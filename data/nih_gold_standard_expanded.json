    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe spike (S) protein decorates the surface of coronavirus (CoV) particles such as SARS-CoV-2 and enables\nCoV's to enter and infect host cells. The S protein is the immunogen in genetic and subunit vaccines against\nCOVID-19, which were critical in controlling the COVID-19 global pandemic. In cells that are infected with CoV's\nor have received a genetic vaccine, the S protein is synthesized in the mammalian cell endoplasmic reticulum\n(ER), and then trafficking via the secretory pathway consisting of ER, Golgi network, and plasma membrane\n(PM). This secretory trafficking of S is bidirectional between ER and Golgi, which are the secretory organelles\nthat provide the enzymatic machinery for post-translational modifications, remodeling, and maturation. This\nincludes enzymes for N-glycosylation, which modulates S folding, viral entry, and interactions with the host\nimmune system. Structure-function investigations have shown that N-glycans modulate conformations of S\ndomains, such as the immunogenic receptor binding domain (RBD). Therefore, S N-glycans play a direct role in\nimmune response modulation. As such, N-glycan maturation changes in S due to tissue-, population-, ethnicity-\n, and age-specific differences in biosynthetic machinery have the potential to dramatically alter infection CoV\noutcomes and genetic vaccine immunogenicity. Yet little is known about the atomic-level consequences of N-\nglycan maturation on S structure-function. This is mainly due to the inability to arrest S in various stages of\ntrafficking and N-glycan maturation. In this grant application, we will use an innovative new methodology to\ncontrol S trafficking. Purified samples of these novel S constructs will be structurally characterized using latest\ncryoEM and computational tools and assayed for interactions with highly potent conformation-sensitive\nantibodies. This will generate unprecedented and the first insights into structural modulation of S conformations\nand epitopes by N-glycan maturation. Collectively, these investigations will be highly significant in providing\nfundamental insights into secretory trafficking and the role of bidirectional trafficking of S in modulating N-glycan\nmaturation and RBD conformations. These data will open avenues for the design of a new generation of S-based\nvaccines with improved immunogenicity. In the future, the insights from this research will serve as a platform to\ninform the design of vaccines against enveloped viruses that pose global health challenges such as HIV and\ninfluenza, which utilize the host cell ER-Golgi-PM secretory pathway to acquire immunity evading glycans.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract:\nThere is an urgent need to develop new approaches to induce broadly protective immunity against rapidly\nmutating viruses. The induction of protective immunity requires the development of memory lymphocytes that\ncan rapidly recognize and neutralize the virus upon re-infection. Virus-specific memory B cells are long-lived\ncells that are critical for the establishment of protective immunity by vaccines. Memory B cells mediate\nprotective immunity by rapidly differentiating into antibody secreting cells upon antigen re-encounter. Memory\nB cells that re-encounter antigen can also undergo further mutation of their B cell receptor to increase their\naffinity for viral antigen. Induction of broadly reactive memory B cells through iterative exposure to cross-\nreactive viral antigens is an emerging vaccination strategy designed to protect against rapidly mutating viruses.\nHowever, efforts to induce broadly reactive memory B cells have been hindered by the relative inefficiency with\nwhich memory B cells diversify their B cell receptor following antigen re-encounter. Better understanding of the\nmechanisms governing memory B cell development is necessary to facilitate the design of vaccines capable of\neliciting a broadly protective memory B cell response.\nAdditionally, effective harnessing of memory B cells to protect against mucosal viruses requires understanding\nhow memory B cells develop and function in barrier tissues. Memory cells are critical for the establishment of\nbarrier immunity, with lung-resident memory B cells recently identified as essential to elicit a rapid and robust\nlocal antibody response following influenza challenge. However, a lack of clarity regarding the pathways\nregulating memory B cells development in barrier tissues remains a significant barrier to designing vaccines\ncapable of inducing tissue-resident memory B cells.\nThis project proposes to characterize how the tissue microenvironment shapes the development of memory B\ncells following viral infection. This project will first determine how viral- and tissue-specific cues influence the\ntranscriptional profile of memory B cells. This proposal will then identify key transcriptional regulators of\nmemory B cell development in barrier tissues and investigate the mechanisms by which these regulators\nfunction. Transcriptional regulators are essential in facilitating memory lymphocyte development and function in\nbarrier tissues. By revealing the developmental pathway of memory B cells in barrier tissues, this study will\nprovide important insight into how vaccines can overcome existing challenges in order to elicit broadly\nprotective immunity against mucosal viruses. The development of vaccines specifically designed to induce\ntissue-resident memory B cells would mark an important paradigm shift away from traditional vaccination\napproaches focused on inducing a systemic virus-specific B cell response.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY. The proposed study responds to NOT-MD-23-008, which calls for community-engaged\ninterventions to increase vaccine uptake among populations experiencing health disparities. We focus on\nCOVID-19 and influenza vaccination, both of which now require annual vaccines. Among those at highest risk\nfor morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality are African American/Black and Latino (ABBL) persons who are not\nup-to-date on these vaccinations. Only 20-28% of adult AABL persons are up-to-date on COVID-19\nvaccination, compared to 31% of White persons, and\nonly 30-40% of AABL persons receive the influenza\nvaccine annually compared to >55% among White persons. AABL experience serious impediments to COVID-\n19 (and to a lesser extent, influenza) vaccination at individual- (e.g., distrust, insufficient knowledge, low\nperceived risk, cognitive biases), social- (e.g., peer norms), and structural-levels of influence (e.g., poor\naccess). Taken together, these comprise multi-level vaccine hesitancy. Factors that promote vaccination\ninclude trusted AABL health educators (peers, nurses), tapping into altruism and collective responsibility,\ncircumventing cognitive biases, and reducing structural barriers. Without efforts to address multi-level vaccine\nhesitancy, rates of COVID-19 and influenza vaccination will remain unacceptably low and racial/ethnic health\ndisparities in infectious disease morbidity and mortality will persist. The proposed study is led by a collaborative\nteam at New York University and the Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation. It uses the multiphase\noptimization strategy (MOST), an engineering-inspired framework, to test effects of individual candidate\nintervention components in a factorial design and then optimize a multi-component intervention made up of the\nmost cost-effective combination of components. Staying up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccination (confirmed with\ndocumentary evidence) is the primary outcome, and influenza vaccination is the secondary outcome. We have\nidentified four promising candidate components, with an emphasis on brevity, low-touch, and future scalability:\nA) nurse-led shared decision making, B) a text message intervention, C) modest lottery prizes for vaccination,\nand D) peer navigation to vaccination appointments. Participants will be N=560 community-residing adult\nEnglish and Spanish-speaking AABL persons who are not up-to-date on COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations\nbut with at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. Specific aims are: Aim 1) identify which of four components\ncontribute meaningfully to improvement in the outcomes; Aim 2) identify mediators (e.g., altruism, norms) and\nmoderators (e.g., sociodemographic characteristics, distrust) of the effects of each component; and Aim 3)\nbuild the most cost-effective intervention package(s). Participants will be randomly assigned to an experimental\ncondition, and assessed at 3- and 6-months post-baseline; N=45 participants will engage in qualitative in-depth\ninterviews. We will also uncover, describe, and plan for implementation issues so the optimized intervention\ncan be rapidly scaled up by community-based and outpatient health organizations.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "A. Summary of Funded Parent Grant:\nFactors Influencing Pediatric Asthma into Adulthood (R01MD019027)\nThe prevalence of asthma among American Indian (AI) children is 9.3% as compared to 5.5% in non- Hispanic\nWhite children. Asthma disparities become even more pronounced into adulthood, with AI adults having the\nhighest prevalence of asthma as compared to all other racial/ethnic groups in the US, with 60% uncontrolled.\nAsthma is influenced by social and environmental factors (SEF) including adverse childhood events (ACEs),\ntobacco smoke, and everyday life stressors that may alter immunological state. ACEs in particular, including\nabuse, neglect, and household challenges have been associated with immune dysregulation, may have\nimplications for clinical outcomes of respiratory viral infections in children that have been linked to asthma and\npersistent respiratory symptoms. For example, Infants who develop severe RSV bronchiolitis in the first year of\nlife are more likely to develop asthma, and children with asthma are at increased risk of experiencing\ncomplications from respiratory viral infections due to SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza,\nand rhinovirus C. In the Factors Influencing Pediatric Asthma (FIPA) study including children from a Northern\nPlains American Indian community, we found children with asthma experienced an increased clinical burden\nfrom RSV infection and had lower levels of serum RSV-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) than children without\nasthma, indicative of immune suppression or dysfunction. However, the complex interplay between social,\nenvironmental and immunological response to viral respiratory infections remains largely unknown, and these\nfactors have not been investigated among AI children with respect to their influence on immunological\nresponse and asthma development and control of asthma symptoms. In this continued AI community-focused\nstudy, we will test the hypothesis that social and environmental factors contribute to asthma susceptibility\nthrough stress-induced immune dysregulation, including the alteration of immunological response to viral\nrespiratory infections. We will also investigate the role of viral respiratory infections and SEF on asthma\ncontrol, including frequency of symptoms, exacerbations, ER visits/hospitalizations, and use of asthma\nmedications.\n Aim 1: Identify social and environmental factors (SEF) that contribute to asthma susceptibility,\nasthma control, and long-term respiratory health in American Indian children. We will follow-up on our\npreviously NIMHD-funded case/control study of 324 children recruited between the ages of 6-17 from 2013-\n2017 as they transition into adulthood (now ages 11-27). We will recontact original study participants,\nevaluating their current asthma status to investigate the role of age and gender on long-term respiratory health\nincluding current asthma and asthma control. We will also expand our study to 400 new participants with and\nwithout asthma between the ages of 6-17, including Tribal members living in Rapid City, SD, and offspring of\noriginal study participants (~30% of original study participants have since become parents). We will obtain\ndetailed measures of SEF, and retrospective information on adverse childhood events (ACE) using an\nestablished screener to evaluate their role in asthma susceptibility and asthma control, including comparisons\nbetween urban vs. rural and multi-generational effects in this community-engaged study. We hypothesize that\ndomains of biological and behavioral influences acting on the individual and interpersonal levels generate\nsocial stress and have an impact on asthma development and control.\n Aim 2: Investigate the role of SEF on immunological response to viral respiratory infections\n(VRIs) in AI children with and without asthma. We will investigate the impact of social and environmental\nfactors measured using validated and Tribally-developed surveys on the immune system of AI children with\nand without asthma, including response to viral respiratory infections (viral-specific serum IgG and IgM\nconcentrations to RSV and other VRI pathogens known to cause long-term respiratory sequelae). We will\nquantify serological measurements of participants\u2019 humoral immune responses including serum biomarkers of\ninflammation (Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines), atopy (serum total IgE), and total immunoglobulins. We will test our\nhypothesis that interactions with detailed survey measures of SEF with immunological and clinical outcomes of\nVRIs, including viral responses in participants with and without asthma are the strongest and most significant\npredictors in our AI participants.\n Aim 3: Engage with an existing Tribal Community Advisory Board (CAB) using continuous\nbidirectional process evaluation to develop an intervention and policy framework of asthma\nprevention. We will engage with the CRST\u2019s dedicated community and Tribal cultural experts and active\nvolunteers in building our local CAB. We will leverage the scientific knowledge gained under this proposal to\nwork with the CAB to create a sustainable, feasible, and Lakota-driven, intervention and policy framework,\nincluding the creation of structures to allow integration of social stressers including ACEs into existing referral\nservices and policy initiatives. We will collect detailed information using questionnaires and semi-structured\ninterviews among CAB members and the community about the study development and processes. We\nrecognize that Tribal children with mild, moderate to severe asthma who are experiencing humoral immune\nresponse alterations and a combination of SEFs need very targeted and specialized preventive measures that\nthis study will be able to develop and support with implementation.\nB. RESEARCH PLAN: Environmental Toxicants and Asthma in American Indian Children\nBackground: Viral respiratory infections in early life have been linked to the development of asthma and\npersistent respiratory symptoms in children 1\u20133, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) of which the majority\nof children are exposed before age 2. Infants who develop RSV bronchiolitis in the first year of life have a high\nchance of developing asthma 4, and children with asthma have an increased risk of experiencing complications\nand lasting respiratory symptoms from infections such as RSV, SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and rhinovirus-C 5\u20138.\nThe prevalence of asthma among American Indian (AI) children is 9.3% as compared to 5.5% in non-Hispanic\nWhite children 9. This is a serious but understudied, pediatric health disparity in the U.S. that becomes even\nmore pronounced into adulthood, with AI adults having the highest prevalence of asthma as compared to all\nother racial/ethnic groups 9. Asthma has been linked to a number of social and environmental factors 10\u201315\nincluding exposure to social stress, tobacco smoke, air pollution, and environmental toxicants including per-\nand perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) 16. There is mounting evidence that PFAS, a \u201cforever chemical\u201d in the\nenvironment has a deleterious effect on many aspects of health 17, including thyroid and immune activity 18,\ninflammation in pregnancy 19, fetal growth 20, immune response to childhood vaccines 21 and viral respiratory\ninfections 22,23. Thus, exposure to PFAS and environmental toxins during childhood may have a lasting effect\non Tribal health. In summary, we propose to address newly emerging chemical exposures including PFAS in\nan at-risk, low income, Native American community in consultation with the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe\n(CRST), including children living in Rapid City South Dakota and the Cheyenne River Sioux and Oglala Lakota\nReservations. In this area of South Dakota, the proportion of children living below the Federal poverty line is\n47% and 57% in Ziebach 24 and Dewey 25 Counties, respectively. The adverse health effects of PFAS and\nenvironmental toxins due to community-level exposure in this area of high childhood poverty has yet to be\ninvestigated, nor their effects on immunological response to viral respiratory infections and immune\ndysfunction.\nPreliminary Research: In the Factors Influencing Pediatric Asthma (FIPA) study we found that AI children\nwith asthma living on the Cheyenne River Sioux and Oglala Lakota Reservations were more likely to reside in\nmulti-unit housing, and in residences with rodent or insect infestation resulting in poor indoor air quality as\ncompared to asthma controls 26. Children with asthma also had higher BMI, total leukocyte counts, %\neosinophils, total serum IgE, and specific IgE to five common indoor airborne antigens 27. We also found\nchildren with asthma to have lower levels of RSV-specific IgG during the winter (Figure 1) and to report\nincreased hospitalizations and RSV diagnoses (Figure 2), suggesting immune dysregulation with clinical\nimplications 28. We hypothesize that exposures to environmental toxins, some of which have been linked to\nimmune dysregulation may play an important role.\nFigure 1: A. Asthma cases recruited during the winter (RSV season) had significantly lower RSV IgG as compared to asthma cases\nrecruited during the summer (p=2.5x10-6). There was no observed difference in seasonality for asthma controls (p=0.60).\nB. More children with asthma have low levels of IgG (<40 IU/mL).\nIn unpublished results, Dr. Erdei (co-PI of parent\nstudy) detected PFAS in 83% of samples from 50\nCRST adults who fish regularly from the Tribe's\nmain public water sources. She has identified an\nassociation between PFAS and a number of tissue-\nspecific and antinuclear autoantibodies, and found\nserum PFAS and other compounds to be predictors\nof autoimmune markers indicative of a\nhyperreactive immune response in adults (Figure\n3). Consuming locally caught fish as part of AI Figure 2: Children with asthma in the FIPA study report a higher\nculture and as a dietary source of protein was also clinical burden from RSV.\nassociated with overall elevation of serum PFAS.\nSimilar investigations among children in the CRST\nwill allow us to learn more about PFAS exposure patterns as it relates to immune dysregulation, viral respiratory\ninfections, and its effect on children\u2019s health in the community.\nFigure 3: Quantile Regression plots in CRST adults showing that A. Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposures are predictive of anti-\nnative DNA response. B. PFOS and C. PFOA exposures are predictive of thyroid-specific (anti-thyroglobulin) autoimmune response,\nwith PFOA having an immunosuppressive effect.\nIn summary, we hypothesize that exposure to environmental toxins, specifically PFAS, contributes to immune\ndysregulation and response to viral respiratory infections in American Indian children with asthma. As\nrecruitment for FIPA2 is starting, this is an opportune time for Dr. Spear to lead a study investigating the role\nof PFAS and environmental toxins on the health of AI children. This opportunity will afford Dr. Spear to narrow\nin on the role of PFAS on immune dysregulation and response to viral respiratory infections in children with\nand without asthma, while making new connections with scientists in the field of environmental research.\nOverall, our study will advance knowledge of the effect of environmental toxins on immune dysregulation of\nchildren to inform future policies and interventions.\nThus, our specific aims for this diversity supplement are:\nSpecific Aim 1: Measure and identify suspect and PFAS chemicals that are present in American Indian\nchildren from Rapid City and the Cheyenne River Sioux/Oglala Lakota Reservations.\nSpecific Aim 2: Perform correlative and predictive modeling between PFAS/suspect chemicals and\nimmunological biomarkers and response to viral respiratory infections in AI children with and without\nasthma.\nApproach: We will perform suspect screening and test for levels of 12 PFAS in serum samples of 52 children\nwith and without asthma and living in urban vs. rural (Reservation) locations (Figure 4). We will identify suspect\nchemicals present in AI children, and perform preliminary correlations with immune biomarkers, viral-specific\nimmunoglobulins, PFAS and suspect chemicals identified. Characterizing the presence and effect of\nenvironmental toxins on the immune system is an essential step for understanding environmental health\ndisparities, which the community has been struggling with for decades.\nFigure 4: Location and summary of serum samples for study to measure PFAS/suspect chemicals in children ages 6-17 years old in\nFIPA2. Recruitment is beginning 5/2024. We also have stored samples for >300 original FIPA participants at -80C (living on\nReservation, only).\nSpecific Aim 1: Measure and identify suspect and PFAS chemicals that are present in American Indian\nchildren from Rapid City and the Cheyenne River Sioux/Oglala Lakota Reservations. We will work with\nthe UCSF Bioassay Facility Core to develop a protocol for PFAS and untargeted suspect screening of serum\nsamples from 52 AI children, including 26 asthma cases and 26 matched controls living in an urban (Rapid City\nSD) vs. rural (Reservation) environment.\nSpecific Aim 2: Perform correlative and predictive modeling between PFAS/suspect chemicals and\nimmunological biomarkers and response to viral respiratory infections in AI children with and without\nasthma. We will test for a correlation of PFAS/suspect chemicals with levels of immune biomarkers and viral-\nspecific immunoglobulins. Immune biomarkers will include cytokines, Creactive protein, CBCs (white blood cell\ncounts), total serum IgE, and viral specific IgG/IgM (SARs-CoV2, RSV, influenza, and rhinovirus C). Results\nfrom this aim will provide insights in to 1) the variability in exposure to environmental toxicants in children living\nin urban vs. rural (Reservation) locations and 2) the role of exposure to PFAS/suspect chemicals on immune\ndysregulation and asthma.\nStatistical analyses: We will examine the distribution of individual PFAS chemicals plus untargeted suspect\nchemicals to determine the relevant statistical test. In general, for commonly detected chemicals we will utilize\nlinear and logistic regression models (or nonparametric tests) to test for associations between PFAS/suspect\nchemicals adjusting for multiple covariates selected through an iterative process (e.g. BMI, sex, household\nsize, asthma medications); we will also contrast models with and without an asthma interaction. For rare\nchemicals we will apply a fisher\u2019s exact test for detected/undetected. ROC curves will be generated for\nindividual chemicals by asthma and location, and cluster analyses will be performed over all chemicals using a\nprincipal component analysis (with UMAP projection) and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)\nfor predictive modeling and Cox regression. Lastly, we will attempt a mediation analysis to evaluate if exposure\nto PFAS/suspect chemicals contributes to asthma via immune dysregulation.\nRelevance to the parent grant: The parent grant is centered on identifying social determinants of the\nenvironment including adverse childhood experiences that contribute to the development of asthma through\naltering the immunological response to viral respiratory infections. However, there is substantial evidence to\nsuggest that exposure to environmental toxicants contribute to immune dysregulation in both the context of\nasthma and general immune function as discussed above. In this proposal, Dr. Spear will focus on the physical\nenvironment, specifically the role of exposure and accumulation of environmental toxicants on immune\ndysregulation in children with and without asthma.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nFamily formation plans (e.g., whether/when to have children) vary by micro-level factors like\nsociodemographics (age, race/ethnicity) and individual- and couple-level influences like finances and job\nsecurity. These micro-level influences do not fully account for variations in reproductive life plans, which are\nalso influenced by macro-level factors like state and local laws and structural inequities. Sexual and gender\nminority (SGM) people's health and wellbeing may be particularly affected by these macro-level factors. Our\nresearch and that of others demonstrate that structural stigma (macro-social conditions like anti-LGBT\nlegislation that negatively impact wellbeing) worsens SGM people's mental and physical health. Given current\nhigh levels of structural stigma in the US, there is an urgent need to understand the potential health and\nwellbeing impacts to halt the widening of already gaping health disparities. One aspect of health and wellbeing\npotentially impacted by anti-LGBT legislation and other forms of structural stigma is having children. Almost\n40% of SGM people are interested in parenting but may face unique barriers in doing so. Being unable to\nfreely plan when, whether, and how to have children excludes SGM people from a health-promoting life stage,\nwhich may drive some SGM-related health disparities (e.g., alcohol use, cardiovascular health, depression).\nThe proposed mixed-methods study will prospectively examine multi-level impacts on SGM couples' family\nformation plans. Aim 1. Quantitatively test multi-level influences on family formation plans through a large-scale\nsurvey of SGM couples. We hypothesize that couples living in states with higher levels of structural stigma will\nbe less likely to plan to have children and more likely to report that state-level policies influence their decision-\nmaking. These associations will be moderated by the racial/ethnic and gender composition of the couple, as\nwell as by SES. Aim 2. Qualitatively describe multi-level factors influencing SGM couples' family formation\nplanning. From the Aim 1 sample, we will recruit couples from states with high and low structural stigma for in-\ndepth dyadic interviews (N=120). We will describe multi-level influences on family formation planning. Aim 3.\nGiven the dynamic sociopolitical landscape for marginalized populations, we will quantify changes in impacts of\nmulti-level factors on family formation plans and well-being over time. We will follow the Aim 2 subsample with\ndyadic pulse surveys (i.e., brief/regular surveys across three years) and a final in-depth dyadic interview. Using\nqualitative trajectory methods and prospective analyses of dyadic pulse surveys, we will test our hypotheses\nthat changes (or lack thereof) in couples' contexts (e.g., moving to another state, legislation changes) will\ninfluence decision-making, mental health, relationship quality, and family formation. This project will produce\nthe first investigation of how multi-level factors prospectively influence SGM couples' family formation plans.\nThis work will have a positive impact by revealing for the first time the multi-level needs of LGBTQ couples as\nthey form families, thereby informing interventions to reduce entrenched inequities.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "CTO1681 to prevent and mitigate cytokine release syndrome in CAR T-cell recipients",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nCytoAgents is developing CTO1681 for the prevention and treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS)\nassociated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. CAR T-cell therapy has emerged as a very\npromising treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) hematologic malignancies. However,\nCAR T-cell therapy can also result in a high incidence of severe and potentially life-threatening immune-mediated\ntoxicity, including CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). CRS is a systemic\ninflammatory response that has been reported as one of the most frequent and dangerous adverse events\nfollowing CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy. CRS is thought to be mediated by an initial release of\nproinflammatory cytokines, which activate bystander immune cells and endothelial cells, which in turn activate\nmore immune cells, culminating in a cytokine storm. Because CytoAgents\u2019 novel approach is focused on\nreducing the transcription of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, its compound is expected to mitigate,\nand in some cases even prevent, CRS. CTO1681 is an orally available, stable compound identical to beraprost\nsodium-314d (BPS-314d), the stereoisomer of the racemate beraprost sodium (BPS) that accounts for nearly all\nof BPS\u2019s pharmacological activity. Because BPS can modulate the release of cytokines from human peripheral\nblood mononuclear cells, CytoAgents has investigated the use of BPS and its active isomer CTO1681 as a\ntreatment for moderate virus-induced CRS, specifically influenza and COVID-19. All of the results to date indicate\nthat CTO1681 has strong potential to reduce the CRS response, leading to better patient outcomes regardless\nof CRS etiology. Overall, BPS, BPS-314d, and CTO1681 formulations have been found to be well tolerated and\nto not completely suppress cytokine levels in healthy volunteers with normal serum levels. CytoAgents is\ncurrently expanding clinical investigation of CTO1681 to the treatment of CAR T-cell therapy-induced CRS.\nCytoAgents\u2019 Phase 1b trial of CTO1681, a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalating safety and pharmacokinetic\n(PK) MAD study in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) receiving CD19-directed CAR T-cell\ntherapy, is scheduled to begin in the coming months. This Direct to Phase II project will support expansion to a\nPhase 2a cohort once the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been determined. The company will\nundertake three specific aims: 1) determining preliminary efficacy of CTO1681 in preventing or reducing CRS\nor ICANS vs. historical or placebo treatment, 2) determining the expanded safety profile of CTO1681 in\npatients with DLCBL receiving CAR T-cell therapy, and 3) investigating the potential impact of CTO1681 on\nantitumor activity of CAR T-cell therapy compared to historical data and placebo.

It is a significant\nchallenge for all of the researchers to maximize the translation efficiency of mRNA vaccine. Multiple factors are\ninvolved to regulate the stability and efficiency of mRNA, including 5' untranslated region (UTR), 3' UTR, codon\net al, and several in silico approaches have been developed to optimize these factors respectively However, as\nthese factors always function together during the translation of mRNA, and individual optimization is insufficient.\nThus, a novel integrated deep learning model for these factors is needed to comprehensively enhance the\nstability and efficiency of mRNA medicine. We propose to develop a platform mRNAdesigner that will address\nthe challenges in design of mRNA sequence to enhance mRNA stability and translation efficiency, and thus\nprovide important information for the development and optimization of mRNA vaccines. mRNAdesigner includes\nthree components: mRNAbase, mRNAoptimizer, and mRNAviewer. mRNAbase is a database to collect high\ntranslational efficiency gene data, the optimized mRNA sequence of ORF, 5' UTR and 3'UTR for any target\nproteins, the energy, secondary structure, and functional annotation of those optimized mRNA sequence of ORF;\nmRNAoptimizer, in silico deep learning optimization of mRNA sequence, provides a fast methodology to\ninvestigate all possible integration of the ORF, 5' UTR and 3'UTR and identify the optimal mRNA sequence; and\nmRNAviewer to visualize the optimized mRNA sequences, the secondary structures and the related functions.\nFinally, the integrated models by designing the 5'UTR, codon, and 3'UTR sequence for representative will be\nexperimentally validate in vitro and in vivo.

    "AWARD_LONG_TITLE": "Understanding the OAS/RNase L pathway during pathogenic viral infections",
    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Understanding the OAS/RNase L pathway during pathogenic viral infections",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n Ribonuclease L (RNase L) is a key component of the mammalian innate antiviral response. For decades, RNase\nL was presumed to reduce viral protein synthesis by cleaving ribosomes to arrest translation. However, we and others\nrecently demonstrated that RNase L-cleaved ribosomes are translation-competent, and that pathogenic viruses can\nsynthesize proteins despite activating RNase L. These observations have revealed a significant gap in knowledge\nregarding how RNase L functions and how viruses evade it. We have demonstrated that RNase L rapidly degrades nearly\nall cellular mRNAs upon activation. This activity regulates three cellular processes that have expanded our understanding\nof RNase L and that have elucidated how pathogenic viruses evade and potentially hijack RNase L functions. First,\nRNase L reprograms translation to an antiviral state by degrading constitutively expressed cellular mRNAs while\nsparing host mRNAs encoding antiviral proteins (e.g., type I interferons), which permits antiviral protein synthesis.\nImportantly, the mRNAs encoded by several pathogenic viruses (e.g., dengue virus) similarly evade RNase L-mediated\nmRNA decay, thus permitting viral protein synthesis. This observation has elucidated how pathogenic viruses synthesize\nproteins despite activating RNase L. This application proposes to characterize the RNase L-mediated mRNA decay\npathway and determine how host and viral mRNAs evade it. Second, RNase L activation triggers the inhibition of nuclear\nmRNA export. This is a critical antiviral mechanism that antagonizes influenza A virus protein synthesis, but it also\ndownregulates the expression of host antiviral proteins (e.g., type I interferons). Importantly, pathogenic viruses (e.g.,\ndengue virus) activate this RNase L-dependent pathway, resulting in sequestration of host antiviral mRNAs in the\nnucleus. This observation suggests that viruses potentially hijack this function of RNase L to limit host antiviral protein\nproduction. This application aims to determine how RNase L inhibits mRNA export, the breadth of viruses it antagonizes,\nhow it impacts host antiviral gene expression during pathogenic viral infections. Third, RNase L regulates the assembly\nof cytoplasmic antiviral ribonucleoprotein complexes. Specifically, RNase L inhibits the assembly of stress granules and\npromotes the assembly of an alternative stress granule-like ribonucleoprotein complex termed RNase L-dependent body.\nRNase L-dependent bodies are the predominant antiviral granule assembled in response to SARS-CoV-2 or dengue virus\ninfection, yet their function is completely unknown. This application aims to determine the function of antiviral stress\ngranules and RNase L-dependent bodies and to determine how their regulation by RNase L alters the antiviral response.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms and functions of these cellular processes will advance our understanding of the\nOAS/RNase L pathway, innate immune antiviral gene induction, and virology. Moreover, it will promote general\nmedicine by broadly characterizing fundamental cellular, molecular, and RNA biology that is relevant to non-infectious\ndiseases, including autoimmune diseases, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Lastly, the proposed research will support the\ndevelopment of promising antiviral, immunomodulatory, and anticancer therapies based on RNase L biology.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nInvestigating the functional aspects of RNA structure is significant as it provides fundamental knowledge of RNA\nbiology and advances emergent technologies that seek to use, and target, RNA therapeutically. Major obstacles\nto such efforts arise from our limited knowledge of the extent of functional RNA structure encoded within human\npathogenic viral genomes. This renewal seeks to advance upon our previous work that developed a\nmethodological pipeline for structured RNA discovery. This approach divides the discovery process into two\nparts: a scanning step, where long sequences are decomposed into overlapping analysis windows from which\nstructure-related metrics are predicted and a folding step, where consensus structures across overlapping\nwindows are generated revealing the most sequence-ordered, thermodynamically stable structures (an\nindication of an evolved property). Our approach has been very successful at identifying highly ordered and\nfunctional structures across an array of human pathogens, e.g., SARS-CoV-2, where discovered motifs were\nused to develop therapeutic leads. Our overarching hypothesis is that many regulatory RNA structures remain\nto be found in the highly restricted space of viral genomes and that they can be uncovered using a holistic\nresearch approach that combines computational and experimental methods. In this renewal, our goal is to make\nimprovements to our discovery pipeline to overcome its current limitations (most significantly to address higher\norder RNA structure) and apply it to medically important viral genomes. The outcomes of this proposal will be:\n(i) the generation of a robust methodological pipeline for functional RNA 2D and 3D structure discovery; (ii)\ninsight into novel regulatory features of pathogenic human viruses; and (iii) leads for future work to\ntherapeutically target RNA structure.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created the greatest infectious threat to global health in 100 years,\nand monumental efforts have been made by the scientific community to combat the SARS-CoV-\n2 virus. This proposal seeks to extend this effort by investigating a mechanism by which SARS-\nCoV-2 hijacks the host cell chaperone system to replicate itself. We have evidence that the\nSARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase (RdRp) co-opts the cytosolic chaperonin containing TCP-1\n(CCT, also called TRiC) to assemble the active polymerase complex. CCT is a large (1 MDa)\nprotein-folding machine that plays a major role in the cellular chaperone network responsible for\nmaintaining the proteome in good working condition. It uses ATP hydrolysis-driven\nconformational changes to assist cytosolic proteins with multiple domains, complex folding\ntrajectories, or obligate binding partners to achieve their native state and assemble into\ncomplexes. In addition to folding cellular proteins, CCT has been shown to bind several viral\nproteins and contribute to viral replication of HIV, hepatitis C, influenza A, rabies, Zika and\nreovirus. These observations show that CCT is a common host chaperone used by diverse\nviruses to fold viral proteins, assemble viral complexes, and support viral replication. Based on\nthese findings, we initiated an investigation of the role of CCT in SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here,\nwe present robust preliminary evidence indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein\n12 (Nsp12), the catalytic subunit of the RNA polymerase, is folded by CCT and that CCT\ncontributes to RdRp complex formation and SARS-CoV-2 replication. In Aim 1, we propose to\nthoroughly test this hypothesis using multiple experimental approaches. In Aim 2, we propose to\ndetermine high-resolution structures of the complex between Nsp12 and CCT. We have isolated\nan Nsp12 folding intermediate bound to CCT and have determined preliminary structures of the\ncomplex by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Further cryo-EM analysis will yield a high-\nresolution structure of the Nsp12-CCT complex, which will be invaluable in guiding the design of\ntherapeutics to block Nsp12 folding by CCT, inhibit formation of the RdRp complex, and disrupt\nviral replication.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY: The goal of this project is to develop a solution that allows for rapid, safe, and\nscalable initial treatment and transport of patients with highly transmissible infectious diseases, including\nCOVID-19 as well influenza, tuberculosis, chickenpox, and measles. This is a necessary innovation because\nresource management and infectious transmission control were two of the greatest challenges healthcare\nproviders faced when fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. When a patient is suffering from highly transmissible\nrespiratory diseases and requires breathing assistance, they are placed in negative pressure rooms.\nHowever, given the limited supply of negative pressure rooms available to prevent virus transmission, and\nthe misperception regarding the safety and effectiveness of negative pressure rooms, a new solution is\nneeded. To help prevent the spread of highly transmissible infectious diseases, start-up company Inspire Rx\nhas developed a personal negative pressure device called the AerosolVE\u2122 BioHelmet. The BioHelmet is\ncapable of preventing the spread of aerosolized pathogens while also enabling the use of non-invasive\noxygen therapies on patients with respiratory diseases such as COVID-19, influenza, tuberculosis, etc. The\nnegative pressure AerosolVE\u2122 BioHelmet immediately isolates patients with any highly transmissible\nrespiratory infectious disease and serves as an instant personal negative pressure environment that is more\neffective than a traditional negative pressure room. The BioHelmet is intended to provide safe transportation\nvia ambulance, airplane, or helicopter, allowing critical transportation staff to remain safe, and it will be\nvaluable in a variety of other healthcare settings. In this project the team will refine and further evaluate the\nAerosolVE BioHelmet, and they will leverage data from their previous in-cabin particle testing to advance the\nBioHelmet as an effective tool at keeping a vehicle/transport cabin free from potentially pathogenic\nrespiratory particles. They will first refine the BioHelmet design to reduce noise and weight, and they will\nfabricate 100 AerosolVE BioHelmets and 20 pump units for follow-on bench testing and clinical user\nevaluations (Aim 1). They will conduct performance and bench testing at FDA-approved labs to ensure the\nsafety and efficacy of the AerosolVE BioHelmet per FDA guidelines (Aim 2). They will deploy the helmet for\nclinical patient use during ground and air ambulance transportation of patients with suspected or confirmed\ncommunicable respiratory illness, including those requiring potential aerosol-generating procedures, and the\npurpose of this will be to obtain user feedback on comfort and east of use from patients and providers (Aim\n3). The BioHelmet will provide a novel, compact, portable, and inexpensive solution that offers a safe\nnegative pressure environment both inside and outside the hospital, which will ultimately save lives by\nallowing for needed patient treatments and protecting healthcare workers.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "The Impacts of Adverse Provider Conditions on Provider Bias and Health Disparities",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nHealthcare disparities that adversely affect patients from racial and ethnic minoritized groups are often attributed\nto provider level factors such as implicit bias. However, efforts to reduce disparities have been hindered by an\nincomplete knowledge of factors that leave providers more vulnerable to bias and their underlying mechanisms.\nThis proposal will address this critical knowledge gap by identifying situations that increase bias among\nhealthcare providers that can be intervened on at the provider and system level. The proposed research\nleverages theory from psychology and psychoneuroimmunology to document the impact of three adverse\nprovider conditions (APCs) that could increase provider bias: (1) workplace demands (e.g., heightened levels of\nstress or burnout), (2) concerns about one\u2019s own health, and (3) increased inflammation occurring during illness.\nWe hypothesize that when providers experience higher (versus lower) workplace demands, are more (versus\nless) concerned about their own health, and experience higher (versus lower) acute inflammation, they will\ndemonstrate more bias against patients from racial and ethnic minoritized groups. We will test our hypothesis in\nthe context of abdominal pain treatment in emergency departments. Participants will be attending physicians,\nnurse practitioners, physician\u2019s assistants, and residents in emergency medicine and internal medicine\nhospitalists who treat abdominal pain for patients who are admitted. We will address three specific aims to\ndocument effects of APCs on quality of care disparities. To address Aim 1, we will use a correlational design to\ndetermine the relationship between APCs and standardized assessments of bias (implicit and explicit bias,\nperception of others\u2019 pain, and social avoidance). To address Aim 2, we will use a randomized controlled\nintervention design; we will use the influenza vaccine to simulate illness by experimentally increasing\ninflammation (indexed by pro-inflammatory cytokine levels). Increases in cytokines are hypothesized to be\npositively associated with standardized assessments of bias. To address Aim 3, we will use a prospective,\nlongitudinal design to tracks provider illness symptoms, stress, burnout, and local cases of infectious illness over\nthe course of a year. These provider data will be correlated with patient data from abdominal pain cases treated\nby the provider on those days. This study has high ecological validity and findings will identify distinct\ncontributions of APCs to lower quality of care, especially for patients from racial and minoritized groups. Overall,\nthe proposed research will have widespread positive impact by outlining paths for novel interventions at multiple\nlevels and domains of influence within the NIMHD Research Framework, such as by engaging administrator and\nclinical management stakeholders in conversations about consequences of staffing policies for health disparities.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nRespiratory viral infections are a prevalent and ongoing threat to global health, as evidenced by seasonal\nInfluenza A infections and the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Notably, the association between allergy and asthma\nand the severity of respiratory viral illness has been long observed but poorly understood. Group 2 innate\nlymphoid cells (ILC2s) and the adaptive counterpart Type 2 CD4 helper cells (Th2) have been extensively\ninvestigated for their role in allergic inflammation. Our group has described the localization of these type 2\nlymphocytes (T2L) in non-lymphoid tissues, such as the lung, at rest and under allergic and mixed type 1-2\ninflammation, observing localization near large airways and vessels at rest and expansion to the tissue\nparenchyma with allergic inflammation. Interestingly, in mixed type 1-2 inflammation, T2L parenchymal\ndistribution is restricted due to Interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) signaling on T2L. My preliminary data demonstrates that\nIFN\u03b3-mediated restriction also occurs following viral respiratory infection with Influenza A virus (IAV, PR8) and\nimpacts mouse body weight and lung function. In parallel, I have demonstrated that loss IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling on\nT2Ls increases body weight loss and impairs lung function in IAV, potentially through a distinct mechanism.\nThese data suggest that IFN-mediated restriction of T2L and T2L topography is critical for appropriate viral\nclearance and/or tissue repair in viral respiratory infection. Mechanisms of IFN-mediated restriction of T2L have\nbeen explored by many groups, including ours, however how this restriction of topography and counter-regulation\nof T1 immunity by T2L dictate the immune response to viral infection remains elusive. I hypothesize that IFN\nsignaling regulates the topography and function of lung T2Ls in pulmonary viral infections. This proposal will\ndefine the topography of T1-T2 cross-regulation in the setting of pulmonary viral infection (Aim 1) and evaluate\nmechanism of interferon mediated restriction of type 2 lymphocytes (Aim 2). Completion of these aims will\nelucidate the role of canonical type 1 and type 2 cytokines in mediating tissue resident lymphocyte function in\ncomplex inflammation, providing novel mechanistic insight into how topography dictates immunity. Completion\nof this study provides a foundation for the development of precision therapeutics to selectively regulate lung\nresident lymphocytes subsets to impact the outcome of diverse lung diseases.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Immunological mechanism of muscle-localizing self-replicating RNA vaccines",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nAs evident in the ongoing \u201ctripledemic\u201d of severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2, Respiratory\nSyncytial virus, and Influenza virus, as well as re-emergence of enterovirus D68, virus infection is an important\nhealth threat and a huge economic burden. Multivalent RNA vaccination is an effective measure for counteracting\nvirus infections and cancerous threats. However, multivalent vaccines need to inject relatively larger doses of\nRNA than monovalent vaccines, which can trigger a potent innate immune response in vivo, causing reduced\ntransgene expression and unwanted reactogenicity. We have recently found that high dose RNA vaccination can\nbe safely achieved in mice by delivering self-amplifying replicon RNA (repRNA) with a family of muscle-localizing\ncationic nanocarriers, LIONTM. In vivo delivery of repRNA by LION restricted the formulation to the muscle and\nlocal lymph nodes without inducing unwanted systemic cytokine responses. Systemic blockade of type I IFN\nsignaling increased transgene expression and the subsequent antibody and T cell responses. Notably, we also\nfound that CD11b+ cells [mostly monocyte dendritic cells (DC)] expand over time after intramuscular injection of\nrepRNA/LION. However, the role of the muscle-infiltrating cells in immunogenicity is unknown. Consequently,\nmany questions remain about how repRNA/LION vaccines induce adaptive immune responses and how\ntransgene expression and adaptive immune responses are inhibited by the type I IFN system. So, Aim 1 looks\nat skeletal muscle DC (SMDC) and characterizes their immunological function both in vitro and in vivo. Aim 2\nfocuses on type I IFN signaling and seeks to identify how type I IFN signaling limits transgene expression and\nadaptive immune responses to repRNA vaccines. Aim 3 spotlights the inflammatory responses to muscle\ndamage and their role in inducing adaptive immune responses to repRNA/LION vaccines. The proposed studies\nwill test the following hypotheses that (1) the muscle plays a critical role in eliciting the immune response to\nintramuscular-based RNA vaccines, and (2) muscle-restricted activation of the immune system is a novel\nstrategy for RNA vaccines to achieve high efficacy with reduced reactogenicity.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "SUMMARY\nInfluenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin (HA) is the canonical example of a class-I viral fusion protein, and thus\nprovides an ideal model system for understanding the fusion mechanisms of many different viruses. Numerous\nother viral envelope glycoproteins, including the SARS-CoV-2 spike, are believed to mediate fusion by a\ncomparable mechanism. Our long-term goal is to establish a complete mechanistic framework of class-I viral\nfusion. We further aim to identify conserved and divergent features of the fusion mechanisms of distinct viruses,\ngenerating specific models that fit within the general framework. HA resides on the surface of the IAV virion and\nfacilitates attachment to the target cell surface through the receptor-binding domain (HA1) engaging SA moieties.\nFollowing endocytosis and trafficking to the late endosome, HA promotes fusion of the viral and endosomal\nmembranes. The model of HA-mediated membrane fusion describes a \u201cspring-loaded\u201d metastable prefusion\nconformation at neutral pH. Dissociation of HA1 from the fusion domain (HA2) allows HA2 to undergo a cascade\nof conformational changes that drive membrane fusion. While extensive structural data exist for HA pre- and\npostfusion, and alternative conformations have been visualized and inferred, the conformational trajectory that\nleads to membrane fusion, including the adoption of anticipated intermediates, has never been explicitly\nvalidated. Nor has the order and timing of conformational changes and membrane fusion been determined. Here,\nwe will utilize a multifaceted approach involving single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer imaging,\nsingle-virion fusion, cryoelectron tomography, and molecular dynamic simulation to directly visualize the\nconformational trajectory undergone by HA during membrane fusion. We will explore the roles of virion\nmorphology, HA density and cooperativity, and target membrane lipid content in mediating HA conformational\nchanges and the mechanism of fusion. We will describe the allosteric connection between distal regions of HA\nthat regulate the timing of fusion, drawing comparison to SARS-CoV-2 S. Finally, we will biophysically\ncharacterize the phenotypic differences between human and avian IAV strains to determine what prevents avian\nIAV strains from entering the human population.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nInfectious disease is a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. Transmission dynamic models have\nplayed a critical role in guiding interventions related to many infectious pathogens, including HIV, influenza,\nSARS-CoV-1, ebolaviruses, SARS-CoV-2, and mpox. Models project how potential interventions (e.g., non-\npharmaceutical measures, therapeutics, and vaccines) may affect disease future transmission. However, they\noften rely on small scale studies to project effects, and there have been growing concerns that models may\nproduce inaccurate, overly optimistic estimates of population-level intervention effectiveness. Observational\ncausal inference models, which measure intervention effectiveness in real-world settings, could help address\nthis limitation, but applying these to infectious disease is not straightforward. Observational approaches, such\nas difference-in-differences and synthetic control methods, estimate the impact of an intervention based on\nempirical counterfactuals: comparing outcomes of interest between treated units or places and similar\nuntreated units. While well-understood with linear outcomes, they can produce biased and misleading results\nin the context of nonlinear transmission dynamics. Even where observational models perform well, it further\nremains challenging to transport estimates to new settings to project the impact of future interventions. To\naddress these issues, this project will develop comprehensive theoretical architecture for synthesizing\ntransmission dynamic models with observational causal inference models \u2013 employing empirical\ncounterfactuals while accounting for complex biological and population dynamics. In the retrospective\nworkstream, I will propose robust specifications for observational causal inference models that can estimate\nunbiased treatment effects in policy evaluations using infectious disease outcomes. I will also develop model\nselection and decision-analytic methods to address potentially significant parameter uncertainty. In the\nprospective workstream, I will develop approaches to generalize estimates from observational causal inference\nmodels to new settings using transmission dynamic models and update projected effects in real-time based on\nlocal surveillance indicators. I will illustrate the implications of our methods by re-analyzing prior studies on\nCOVID-19 as well as applying them to answer new questions about respiratory illness control, in collaboration\nwith partners in state and local public health institutions. Across both workstreams, I will develop and\ndisseminate open-source public tools and software to facilitate adoption of these methods. Overall, this work\nwill produce a suite of methodological innovations to improve understanding of the impact of past policies and\nthe accuracy of future projections, while also supporting their implementation in public health institutions to\nguide planning and priority setting.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary (Abstract):\n Emerging and re-emerging respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and\navian and swine influenza viruses continue to pose a significant challenge to public health. These highly\npathogenic viruses successfully evade host immunity and replicate to high titers, causing excessive\ninflammation, acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and fatal pneumonia.\nHowever, the host and virus factors that facilitate impaired antiviral response and excessive inflammation\n(dysregulated immunity) that lead to ALI and lung pathology are not known. In novel preliminary findings,\nwe identify that toll-like receptor (TLR)-extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 activity is central to SARS-\nCoV-2 and viral-RNA-induced dysregulated lung immunity. Notably, blocking ERK1/2 activity not only\nreduced SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory cytokine production but also enhanced antiviral IFN-I\nresponse. Therefore, based on our strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that myeloid cell-intrinsic TLR-\nERK1/2 signaling promotes pathogenic lung inflammation and suppresses antiviral immunity. The primary\nobjective of the proposed study is to demonstrate the critical role of myeloid-cell TLR-ERK1/2 signaling in\nSARS-CoV-2-induced dysregulated immunity, acute lung injury (ALI), and lung pathology, and to evaluate\nthe therapeutic potential of blocking ERK1/2 activity in suppressing lethal inflammation while enhancing\nantiviral. We will define the role of myeloid cell-intrinsic TLR-ERK1/2 activity in SARS-CoV-2-induced lung\ninjury and pathology (Aim 1), demonstrate the role of myeloid cell intrinsic TLR-ERK1/2 activation in the\ndysregulation of SARS-CoV-2-specific lung T cell response (Aim 2), and test the therapeutic potential of\nblocking ERK1/2 signaling with or without antivirals in reducing lung injury and protecting mice from lethal\nSARS-CoV-2 infection (Aim 3). The results obtained from this study will provide a foundation for identifying\nspecific targets to moderate lung inflammation and injury, which in combination with antivirals, can be used\nto improve ALI, ARDS, and clinical outcomes.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "TMPRSS2 as a potential target for treatments of COVID-19 and respiratory infectious viruses in lung",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\n In early 2020, a new virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), generated headlines due to\nits unprecedented rate of transmission. SARS-CoV-2 caused the first reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nin December 2019 and continues to spread worldwide. As a family of RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is prone to mutate at a rate\nup to a million times faster than its hosts1,2. These rapid genomic alterations have already generated highly transmissible\nvariants, and have raised concerns that the virus will evade vaccine-induced immunity. In addition, a large percentage of\nthe global population remains unvaccinated, due to the challenges of production and mass distribution, vaccine hesitancy,\nand pending approval status for patients under age 12. Therefore, an effective antiviral has the potential to relieve suffering\nfor millions\u2014not only helping individual patients recover and reducing the number of deaths, but also limiting the number\nof positive carriers and thereby curbing the spread of the pandemic.\n This proposal aims to develop an efficient antiviral to impede the virus\u2019 entry into cells, specifically into lung alveolar type\nII (AT2) cells, the stem cells of the distal lung. Thanks to recent studies, we know which \u201cdoor\u201d (a receptor called ACE2) and\n\u201ckey\u201d (a protease called TMPRSS2) the virus uses to enter cells. Our goal is to remove the key so the virus cannot open the\ndoor and enter host cells. We will use a conventional air-liquid interface (ALI) culture that is representative of the in vivo\nairway and a recently developed 3-dimensional (3D) in vitro lung organoid model that recapitulates many aspects of lung\nstructure and the cellular environment and that has been used to study respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. These\nsystems represent tissues better than cell lines, but offers the benefit of being less complex than tissue explants or animal\nmodels. In addition, we have generated a panel of highly sensitive and specific mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)\ndirected against TMPRSS2. In preliminary studies, the lead TMPRSS2 mAb, AL20, shows no signs of cytotoxicity with a trend\ntowards inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry in cell lines and in lung organoids. Furthermore, we have identified at\nleast two serine protease inhibitors (serpins) that form complexes with TMPRSS2, and the presence of these complexes is\ninversely correlated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. These findings lead to our hypothesis that targeting TMPRSS2 can\ninhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and spread.\n To test our hypothesis, we will first test the efficacy of AL20 for blocking the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into AT2 cells in lung\norganoids and in airway epithelial cells in ALI cultures, and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We will then evaluate the\neffects of serpins on TMPRSS2 activity and SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and spread. Finally, to explore the feasibility of advancing\nAL20 to human trials, we will test humanized AL20 in a SARS-CoV-2 hamster model. Syrian golden hamsters are naturally\nsusceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection that recapitulates the clinical, virological, histopathological, and immunological\ncharacteristics of human disease, enabling study of its pathogenesis, transmission, and passive immunization effect.\nTransgenic human ACE2 is not required for SARS-CoV-2 infection, ensuring that the cell types infected are highly relevant.\n These studies will provide critical insights into the mechanisms whereby TMPRSS2 regulates SARS-CoV-2 entry, and suggest\npotential therapeutic candidates against COVID-19. The proposed work has the potential to impact the lives of millions of\nindividuals affected by COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, such as influenza A, that use TMPRSS2 to enter cells.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\n Our laboratory has a long standing interest in understanding the catalytic and regulatory mechanism of\nthe proton pumping vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase, V1Vo-ATPase), a dynamic multisubunit membrane integral\nrotary motor enzyme found in all eukaryotic cells. The V-ATPase acidifies the lumen of organelles and, in\nprofessional acid secreting cells, the extracellular space. Enzyme function is required for fundamental cellular\nprocesses such as endocytosis, bone remodeling, protein trafficking, acid-base balance, sperm maturation,\nand neurotransmitter release. While complete loss of V-ATPase function is embryonic lethal, partial loss or\nhyperactivity is associated with numerous human diseases such as osteopetrosis, diabetes, male infertility,\nneurodegeneration, and cancer. Moreover, some viruses such as influenza rely on the acidic environment\ncreated by the V-ATPase for infection. Fighting these diseases on a molecular level will require a detailed\nunderstanding of the structure, catalytic mechanism and regulation of the eukaryotic V-ATPase. In cells, V-\nATPase activity is regulated by a unique mechanism referred to as \u201creversible disassembly\u201d, wherein the\ncomplex reversibly dissociates into V1-ATPase and Vo proton channel, with both sub-complexes becoming\nautoinhibited. Despite its important role in V-ATPase physiology, the molecular mechanism of reversible\ndisassembly is poorly understood. This gap in knowledge is largely due to a lack of both high-resolution\nstructural information and an in vitro model system to study the process under defined conditions, aspects that\nwe are working to address. An interesting, and technically challenging feature of the mammalian V-ATPase is\nthat most of its subunits are expressed as multiple isoforms. However, as such isoforms display differential\ntissue enrichment, they may provide opportunities for targeted therapeutics. Indeed, several diseases have\nbeen linked to malfunction or upregulation of specific isoform containing V-ATPase. However, how different\nisoform combinations determine tissue localization, and whether these isoform specific complexes have unique\nbiochemical or regulatory properties, is currently unknown. We have started to develop a system to purify wild\ntype and mutant forms of human V-ATPase in an isoform specific fashion for biochemical and structural\nanalyses. Further, we are developing single-domain antibodies (Nanobodies) against specific subunit isoforms\nto serve as research tools, and to explore isoform specific modulation of V-ATPase activity in disease. Our\nresearch program employs the tools of structural biology, cell biology, biochemistry and biophysics to address\nbroad questions of V-ATPase catalytic and regulatory mechanisms. For some fundamental aspects of V-\nATPase structure and regulation, we study the enzyme from yeast, a well documented model system for the\nhuman V-ATPase. We use human tissue culture for questions that cannot be addressed in yeast, such as\nstructure and biochemical properties of specific isoform containing enzymes. The long term goal of our\nresearch is to find ways to modulate the activity of disease causing V-ATPases in an isoform specific way.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nThere are more than 230,000 new cases of lung cancer and over 130,000 deaths due to lung cancer each year\nin the U.S. Approximately 120,000 people each year will present with metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\n(mNSCLC) for the first time, and only 7% of these patients will survive five years or more.\naccurius is developing the first of a kind inhalable agent that will be a safe and highly effective treatment for\nmNSCLC and other cancers metastatic to the lung. The agent is an engineered oncolytic virus based on the\nInfluenza A virus (eIAV) which will selectively infect and destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy cells and\ninduce the body\u2019s own anti-tumor immune response. This treatment will dramatically improve overall survival\nrates for the metastatic NSCLC patient population as well for the 50,000 patients each year with different tumor\ntypes that have their cancer metastasize to the lung.\nPhase I of the accurius project will determine the top two eIAV candidates in the accurius pipeline, each of\nwhich must improve median survival time by more than 50% versus the control arm in animal models while\nshowing significant ability to elicit the natural immune response to the presence of the tumors. Follow-up\ntesting will determine if either or both of the candidates can improve median survival time by an additional 25%\nin combination with an immune checkpoint blocker.\nPhase II will finalize the cell culture-based manufacturing process for the candidate(s) which passed both tests\nin phase I and also optimize their inhalable form. The inhalable forms will then have to pass the same efficacy\nand natural immune response stimulation tests as in Phase I as well as demonstrating safety in animal models\nwithout tumors in order to proceed to further clinical testing in humans.\nThe potential realizable market for accurius\u2019s safe, inhalable, effective eIAV is over 100,000 metastatic lung\ncancer patients annually in the US alone, the vast majority of whom will not respond to currently available\ntreatments and face dismal survival prospects.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY:\n It is being increasingly recognized that changes in chromatin state are associated with a wide spectrum of\nlung diseases, ranging from bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD). However, the mechanisms by which these changes contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases,\nand how to manipulate the epigenome for therapeutic benefit, remains largely unknown. Modulation of chromatin\naccessibility is an important epigenetic mechanism by which gene expression is controlled, even across repeated\ncell divisions. However, as a prerequisite to understanding how altered chromatin accessibility contributes to\ndisease, the mechanisms by which chromatin accessibility patterns first establish and maintain cellular identity\nwithin the lung must be defined.\n This proposal is based on studies from our group that identified the SWI/SNF proteins Arid1a and Arid1b\nas key mediators of the chromatin accessibility changes that occur during development of the SOX9+ lung\nepithelial stem/progenitor cell population. Our data demonstrate that loss of Arid1a or Arid1b led to persistence of\nthe SOX9+ progenitor cell population, impaired alveolar differentiation, and neonatal death due to respiratory\ndistress. In addition, ARID1A directly interacts with NKX2-1 and SOX9. The central hypothesis of the present\nproposal is that ARID1A and ARID1B interact with key lung developmental TFs to direct the SWI/SNF complex to\nremodel chromatin at specific loci, silencing progenitor cell gene expression programs and promoting the\nmaturation and function of the mature alveolar epithelium. The proposed studies will: A) Define the role that\nArid1a/Arid1b, and the larger SWI/SNF complex, play in establishment of mature alveolar cell type identify in\nmouse and human. B) Identify the mechanism(s) by which this SWI/SNF complex remodels chromatin, in\nconjunction with key lung transcription factors, to establish and maintain gene expression modules controlling\ntype I & II AEC identity and function. C) Determine how Arid1a/Arid1b-mediated chromatin remodeling contributes\nto the lung epithelial repair response following influenza infection.\n These studies will provide conceptual advances in our understanding of how mature alveolar epithelial\ncells are established and maintained, how the chromatin accessibility landscape interacts with previously well-\ndefined transcription factor networks, and how chromatin remodeling direct the normal repair process after lung\ninjury. Emerging epigenomic tools and systems biology approaches will be applied to the epithelium for the first\ntime. Taken together, these data will inform future translational studies seeking to understand how alterations in\nthe epigenome contribute to lung disease, and will provide a foundation for future efforts to manipulate the lung\u2019s\nepigenomic code to restore normal lung structure and function.",

We propose an\nancillary study to an NIA-funded trial U01AG076941 (EVERLAST) that we call Impacting inflammation through\nmechanistic Target Of Rapamycin (imTOR). The EVERLAST parent trial will test the ability of low/intermittent\ndoses of the rapamycin analogue everolimus to selectively inhibit mTORC1 but not mTORC2, and thus\nimprove multiple indicators of healthspan, while avoiding the undesirable side-effects of rapamycin.

We will complement primary focus on T\ncells with analyses of myeloid cells, the latter a secondary source of systemic inflammation. Mechanistic\ninsights into everolimus action on immune cells will be analyzed relative to changes in hallmarks of aging\ncollected for EVERLAST. We will compare mitochondrial outcomes between immune cells and skeletal muscle\nto challenge the assumption of similar everolimus impacts on distinct tissue types. Parallel ex vivo\nmanipulations will establish cause/effect relationships amongst everolimus, mTORC1/2 function, cell\nphysiology, cytokine profiles, and the frequency of polyfunctional T cells, a newly appreciated modulator of\ninflammatory disease.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nSignificance. One-third of patients with severe lung infection by influenza A virus (IAV) develop secondary\ninfection by inhaled Staphylococcus aureus (SA). Coinfection by IAV and SA causes about 30% mortality despite\ntherapy. It remains unclear how IAV promotes secondary SA infection, particularly in lung alveoli. This issue is\nimportant because alveoli are the anatomical site of fatal SA-induced Acute Lung Injury (ALI), but alveolar\ndefense mechanisms, including alveolar wall liquid (AWL) secretion, should prevent SA stabilization and\ncoinfection initiation. The long-term objective of this proposal is to determine alveolar responses to IAV that\npromote secondary SA infection in alveoli, resulting in SA-induced alveolar damage, ALI, and mortality. The\nhypothesis is IAV lung infection inhibits AWL secretion, a homeostatic mechanism by which alveoli clear inhaled\nparticles. The inhibition causes alveolar retention of SA and the secreted SA toxin, alpha hemolysin (Hla). The\nretention enhances alveolar contact with SA and Hla, promoting SA stabilization against the alveolar wall and\nHla-induced alveolar fluid barrier loss, leading to alveolar edema and fatal ALI. In addition to directly supporting\nthe hypothesis, preliminary data indicate IAV lung infection caused: (A) dephosphorylation, hence inactivation of\nthe alveolar cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel, the critical protein for\nAWL secretion; and (B) methylation of the CFTR-dephosphorylating protein, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)\ncatalytic subunit (PP2Ac), which may promote PP2Ac-CFTR interactions. Specific Aims are as follows. Aim 1\nwill define the role of CFTR in alveolar retention of inhaled SA. Aim 2 will define the role of PP2Ac methylation\nin IAV-induced inhibition of AWL secretion. Since our preliminary data suggest CFTR and the PP2Ac-\nmethylating enzyme, leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (LCMT1) may represent new therapeutic targets to\nrestore AWL secretion in IAV-infected lungs, Aim 3 will test the therapeutic potential of CFTR- and LCMT1-\ntargeted approaches to protect against coinfection-induced alveolar damage, ALI, and mortality. These Aims\nwill be achieved using our established methods, which include cell culture, mouse models of ALI, and real-time\nconfocal microscopy of live, intact mouse and human lungs. Determinations in IAV-infected mice will include\nmeasures of: (1) alveolar retention of SA; (2) AWL secretion; (3) alveolar CFTR phosphorylation status;\n(4) alveolar PP2Ac methylation status; (5) SA- and Hla- alveolar epithelial damage and alveolar barrier loss; and\n(6) SA-induced pulmonary edema and mortality. We will use: (i) wild type mice treated with inhibitors of alveolar\nPP2Ac-CFTR and PP2Ac-LCMT1 interactions, including drug inhibitors, plasmid DNA encoding mutant proteins,\nand siRNA; and (ii) transgenic mice lacking alveolar epithelial CFTR and LCMT1 expression.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT ABSTRACT\nWe aim to increase student\u2019s understanding and interest in science through active participation in the first large-\nscale surveillance initiative targeting avian viruses like influenza viruses (AIV) and avian paramyxoviruses\n(APMV, also known as Newcastle disease virus) ever conducted in an urban area - New York City (NYC) - via\nanalysis of bird droppings. The New York City Virus Hunters (NYCVH) initiative will enable teachers, students\nand interested community members to gain an understanding of the interaction of natural environments and\nhuman health, while increasing their knowledge, confidence, and interest in science.\nThe NYCVH initiative will build on strong collaborations between the Krammer Laboratory at the Icahn School of\nMedicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), a globally leading laboratory in virology, and BioBus, a leading NYC science\noutreach and education institution. NYCVH will develop and provide all the training, equipment, materials, and\ninfrastructure needed to support this large-scale, community-science-driven research effort. NYCVH will be\ndesigned to offer multiple entry points and levels of engagement for interested community scientists - such as\nstudents, teachers or community members - to participate. Trainings will ensure that interested teachers gain an\nunderstanding of modern viral surveillance techniques and have ways to easily incorporate NYCVH program\naspects of their choice into their work. Over the course of the program, 6000 middle and high school students\nwill be led by 100 teachers trained at workshops held at BioBus\u2019s BioBase Harlem inside Columbia University\u2019s\nZuckerman Institute. Workshops will introduce teachers to modern viral surveillance using molecular techniques,\nexperimental design, laboratory and bioinformatics methods, sampling kit components, and detail how teachers\nand students can participate in research to prevent the next pandemic. Through BioBus\u2019 network we will enlist\npartner schools to broaden participation in the program including through large-scale sampling events. In\naddition, and importantly, 25 high school students from historically underrepresented communities in science will\nbe trained to spearhead the initiative as Junior Research Scientists who will join the NYCVH as interns over the\nacademic year and get an intensive training in sampling, nucleic acid detection, sequencing, phylogenetic\nanalysis and virology in general to become the next generation of leading virologists. With ISMMS, BioBus and\nplus a network of scientists from academic institutions and wildlife rehabilitators, those students will be supported\nthroughout their research process \u2013 study design, sample collection, sample processing, analyzing results, and\npresenting their research at symposia.\nThis project will be evaluated using a mixed-methods approach tailored to understanding the impact of program\nparticipation on all individuals. The structure of this program is designed to determine the feasibility and impact\nof large-scale studies at the urban human \u2013 avian interface through participatory research, and influence on\nstudent\u2019s long-term STEM career goals.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Eosinophils as Effectors of Antibacterial Immunity in the Lungs",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Pneumonia results from uncontrolled lung inflammation and injury often triggered by viral/bacterial pathogen\ninsults. Pneumococci, instigating agents of bacterial pneumonia, are independently pathogenic causing lower\nrespiratory tract infections and hospitalizations in adults, including those with chronic pulmonary conditions like\nasthma. Pneumococci are also opportunistic pathogens particularly synergizing with respiratory viruses, like\ninfluenza A virus (IAV), to cause severe morbidity and excess mortality. Our prior work established that IAV\ninfection during heightened eosinophilic allergic inflammation was host protective, recapitulating clinical data\nfrom the 2009 Swine Flu pandemic. Using a laboratory model we developed to investigate mechanisms by which\nthis protection occurred, we identified novel functions for eosinophils as direct mediators of antiviral immunity\nduring early and late phases of IAV infection. Importantly, eosinophilic asthma was also host protective during\nco-infection with IAV and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), an outcome that was lost in eosinophil deficient\nmice. Further preliminary data show that eosinophils, a) internalize Spn in large numbers, b) kill intracellular and\nextracellular Spn, c) undergo physiologic and phenotypic alterations in response to Spn uptake. These data led\nto our central hypothesis that eosinophils in allergic airways promote anti-bacterial immunity against Spn through\ndirect and indirect mechanisms to reduce the bacterial load and safeguard the host. The two overlapping aims\nto be investigated in this project are: (1) To determine mechanisms and outcomes of interactions between\neosinophils and Spn, and (2) To elucidate pathways by which eosinophil-Spn interactions impact surrounding\nleukocytes important in mucosal host defense during co-infection. This project is significant because we propose\nto identify basic immune mechanisms in pulmonary host defense against a prominent human pathogen with an\ninnovative approach of investigating eosinophils as a regulator of local innate immunity and mediator of host\nprotection rather than as an end-stage effector cell. These studies will have a broad impact on eosinophil biology,\non our appreciation of host-pathogen interactions in allergic asthma and may offer novel therapeutic targets to\ntreat bacterial co-infections during influenza in allergic hosts.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nVaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal disease, and shingles lead to significant rates of illness,\nhospitalization, and death among older adults. In the United States, vaccination rates have been mostly unchanged for a\ndecade with lower rates among racial and ethnic minority groups. New and scalable approaches are needed to address this\nimportant public health issue.\nNudges are changes to the way choices are offered or information is framed that can have outsized effects on behavior.\nFor example, default options are the path of least resistance and the action that takes place if no alternatives are selected.\nActive choice is a method that prompts a decision-making now, rather than waiting for stakeholders to recognize the need\nto make the decision on their own. Our groups at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Medicine) and the University of\nWashington (UW Medicine) have formed behavioral design teams embedded within the operations of our health systems\nand have demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic\nhealth records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, this scalable technology platform is\nan optimal environment to implement and deploy these types of nudges.\nIn this study, we propose to design, test, and implemented personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target barriers\namong high-risk subgroups to improve vaccination rates. We will pilot this at two health systems and then implement a\npragmatic trial at those health systems and sites in the VA Health System. In the R61 phase, we will focus on the\nfollowing aims at Penn Medicine and UW Medicine. Aim 1: To use EHR data and analytical methods to identify high-risk\ngroups of older adults with suboptimal vaccination rates for influenza, pneumococcal disease, and herpes zoster. Aim 2:\nTo assess the feasibility of implementing different types of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target the\nidentified groups to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 3: To pilot test ways to personalize promising\nnudges to clinicians and patients for improving vaccination among older adults.\nIn the R33 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine, UW Medicine, and the VA Health System. Aim\n1: To conduct a 12-month, multisite, cluster randomized, pragmatic trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized\nnudges to clinicians and patients relative to control to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 2: To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the intervention on reducing disparities in vaccination rates related to race/ethnicity and\nsocioeconomic factors. Aim 3: To evaluate heterogeneity in treatment effect across clinician, patient, and practice\ncharacteristics to further tailor approaches in future intervention design.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Most quantitative models in biomedical research have been formulated by ordinary differential equations \n(ODEs). Despite the great contributions ODEs have made to biology and beyond, the high-dimensional, \ntime-dependent factors of the immune system still pose a significant challenge to the predictive value of \nODEs as it would require several hundred equations and thousands of parameters to be estimated. The \nrecent rise of machine learning as a powerful computational tool to integrate large datasets presents a \nspecial opportunity to deal with the inherent complexity of biological systems. However, machine learning \napproaches do not consider the mechanistic knowledge of the underlying interactions. Preliminary studies \nthat combine ODEs and machine learning highlight that these computational algorithms could be on the \ncusp of a major revolution. Remarkably enough, however, no parameter estimation theory exists to \nintegrate simultaneously both approaches. We propose to create new hybrid models and test their \npredictions in a mouse viral coinfection system to address a central vexation for infection biology which is \nhow and when to modulate immune responses to mitigate mortality during lethal respiratory viral infection. \nAt the interface between mathematical and life sciences, we will develop and analyze a novel suite of \ncomputational models that will integrate the underlying biological mechanisms to manage ill-posed \nproblems and explore massive design spaces, allowing for robust predictions from complex biological \nsystems. To validate and test our novel and foundational mathematical approaches, we will generate the \nbiological data from a mouse infection system with a mild viral pathogen (rhinovirus) two days before \ninfection with a lethal viral pathogen (influenza) that results in reduced disease compared to single infection \nalone. We hypothesize that this system can train our mathematical models in a natural way how the innate \nimmune system can be manipulated to reduce mortality to lethal infections and beyond. Key model \npredictions will be tested by targeted immune system manipulation during lethal infection, paving the way to \nunderstanding the role of complex immune interactions in respiratory viral disease pathology.",

During the course of\nan immune response, antibodies will increase affinity to their antigens through somatic hypermutation. The\nhuge diversity of antibodies enables human immune system to confer protection against various pathogens by\nrecognizing a wide range of antigens and epitopes. Detailed molecular characterization of antibody-antigen\ninteraction is crucial to vaccine and therapeutic development, as well as the fundamental understanding of the\nhuman immune system.\n The binding specificity and epitope of an antibody are determined by its structure, which in turn is\ndetermined by its amino acid sequence. As a result, information on the binding specificity and epitope of an\nantibody are encoded in its amino acid sequence. However, accurately predicting the epitopes of antibodies\nfrom their sequences is an extremely difficult task because our understanding of antibody sequence-function\nrelationship is far from comprehensive. This proposal aims to develop a library-to-library screening approach to\ncharacterize antibody-antigen interaction in a high-throughput manner, with a focus on influenza A\nhemagglutinin (HA) as a proof-of-concept. Specifically, we will determine the HA-binding specificity and\nconformational epitope of hundreds of thousands of antibodies in a single experiment. Subsequently, antibody\nsequence features that are associated with different epitopes on HA will be systematically identified. We further\naim to use these antibody features to identify HA-binding antibodies from publicly available antibody repertoire\nsequencing datasets as well as predict their epitopes on HA. While this proposed project focuses on influenza\nHA, our approach can be easily extended to any antigen of interest. This proposal will open up the possibility\nfor antibody sequence-based epitope prediction and provides new perspectives to the understanding of human\nantibody repertoire.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAn ideal \"universal flu vaccine\" should have the ability to trigger broadly protective antibody and humoral memory\nresponses against both existing and future influenza viral strains. However, a major obstacle in achieving this\ngoal is immunodominance in B cell responses, which tend to prioritize dominant epitopes at the expense of\nconserved yet subdominant epitopes. In the case of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA), the variable globular head\ndomain is highly immunodominant over the stem epitope that is much more conserved. To address this challenge,\na Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist-based nanoparticle (NP) adjuvant (TLR7-NP) has been developed to induce\nprolonged and localized TLR7 signaling in the draining lymph nodes. In contrast to TLR7 agonist formulated with\nalum (TLR7-alum), the TLR7-NP adjuvant has demonstrated a remarkable ability to overcome\nimmunodominance and stimulate a broad antibody response targeting the subdominant HA stem epitope. There\nis a critical need to understand the precise mechanisms controlling B cell immunodominance and the breadth of\nhumoral responses. The goal of this research is to gain mechanistic insights into how adjuvant formulation\ninfluences B cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors that shape immunodominance and the breadth of humoral\nresponses. The overarching hypothesis is that the interplay between B cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors,\nprompted by prolonged TLR signaling through nanoparticle formulated adjuvant, facilitates the recruitment,\nselection and effector differentiation of germinal center (GC) B cells specific for the subdominant epitopes. This\nhypothesis will be tested through two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine how TLR7-NP impacts\nimmunodominance, breadth and tolerance across different stages of B cell memory development. The goal of\nthis aim is to identify the \u201cbottleneck\u201d that has the greatest influence on the immunodominance and breadth of\nthe humoral response. Aim 2 will elucidate the interplay between extrinsic factors and B cells underlying the\nenhancement of antibody breadth by TLR7-NP. In this aim, we will use genetic models to manipulate the\nsurrounding cell types as well as the microenvironment to investigate how these specific pathways contribute to\nthe altered B cell immunodominance, a crucial mechanism underlying the breadth induced by TLR7-NP. This\nresearch proposal is innovative because it makes a conceptual advance in understanding the mechanisms\ngoverning the breadth of humoral responses, linking it to the spatiotemporal regulation of signaling through\nadjuvant formulation. This research proposal is significant because these insights will not only advance our\nunderstanding of how vaccine adjuvants work but also will empower us to refine vaccine strategies to precisely\nmanipulate the breadth of B cell response. Ultimately, this will unlock new opportunities for the rational design of\nuniversal influenza vaccines.\n1",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary:\nRegulation of immune responses in the lung is a critical determinant of health. While the immune system must\nrespond to viral and bacterial pathogens, these responses must be finely tuned so as not to reduce organ\nfunction. Aberrant immune responses to viral pathogens in the lung can result in significant morbidity and\nmortality.\nControl of maladaptive host immune responses occurs through a number of mechanisms including input from\nthe nervous system. Reciprocal communication between these two systems throughout the body has emerged\nas a mechanism to detect pathogens and coordinate host-protective immune responses and control\ninflammation. Although neuro-immune circuits in the lung are known to exist, the contribution of these to the\nregulation of inflammation caused by virus-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns is unknown.\nBuilding on our preliminary data showing the regulation of lung inflammation by a unique neuro-immune circuit,\nthe overall goals of this project are to precisely determine the role of vagal afferent neurons, the neuro-immune\ncircuitry, signaling used, and how immune cell function is regulated.\nBy using complementary and unique tools, the role of vagal afferent neurons and the processes these neurons\nevoke to suppress lung inflammation will be determined. To achieve this, we will use selective activation of\nvagal afferent neurons, perform identification of lung-specific vagal afferents, and confirm the role of \u03b22AR and\nthe source of catecholamines that regulate acute lung inflammation induced by a TLR agonist. Finally, we will\nassess if this novel anti-inflammatory pathway can be evoked to control inflammation during influenza infection\n(SA1). Understanding of the endogenous reflex triggered by lung inflammation will be performed using a\ncombination of optogenetic silencing of the vagal afferents, pharmacological antagonists, and novel mice with\nconditional TLR7 deficiency in vagal afferents, to deduce if neurons sense viral components, and the\nmechanisms of immune regulation elicited. Finally, the role of sympathetic lung innervation will be assessed,\nand the requirement for specific neurotransmitter receptors tested (SA2). Together, these proposed studies will\ndecipher the contribution and components of a novel lung anti-inflammatory pathway that limits acute lung\ninflammation.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nThe global control of TB is compounded by co-infection with HIV. Those infected with HIV are at high risk of\nreactivating latent TB infection (LTBI). Decades of research has not yielded a successful vaccine for the TB/HIV\nsyndemic. While therapeutics control Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and HIV burden, they have a potential\ndisadvantage of selecting for resistance and not rescuing from the immune dysfunction. Targeting the host\nimmune response via a host-directed immunotherapy (HDT) provides an opportunity to augment immunity during\nthe short-window of acute HIV-1 co-infection of Mtb. Treatment of LTBI in people living with HIV (PLHIV) reduces\nthe risk of active TB by only 35% and is dependent on the CD4 counts at the time of initiation.\n Though combinatorial antiretroviral therapy (cART) concurrently given with anti-TB therapy improves the\nclinical and microbiological parameters, it leads to insufficient reconstitution of protective TH1, TH17 and CD4+ TEM\nlevels in the lungs and fails to rescue from virus-driven immune activation. Additionally, the long-term sterilization\nof bacteria and immune reconstitution in the lungs has not been shown in the individuals treated concurrently\nwith cART and 3HP. HIV infection depletes IL-21 producing CD4+ T cells and cART only partially restores IL-21\nin humans. We hypothesize that supplementing cART and once-weekly, three-month isoniazid and rifapentine\n(3HP) treatment with IL-21-IgFc fusion protein in Mtb/SIV co-infection will result in a long-term reconstitution of\nTH1 response and functional CD4+T effector memory (TEM) response in the lung. Further, IL-21-IgFc fusion protein\nadjunctive to cART and 3HP, will augment cytotoxic function of NK cells, thus significantly reducing the likeliness\nof LTBI reactivation in Mtb/SIV co-infection.\n Hence, we aim to explore a HDT that utilizes IL-21-IgFc fusion protein supplementation of cART+3HP\nto mitigate virus-driven immune dysregulation and thus reduce incidence of LTBI reactivation. By concurrently\ntreating Mtb/SIV co-infected macaques with cART+3HP+IL-21-IgFc fusion protein, our goal is to significantly\nreduce LTBI reactivation by providing long-term immune reconstitution concurrent to bacterial control by i)\ninduction of an adequate TH1 response via STAT1, ii) generation of CD4+ TEM cells, iii) maintenance of TH17\nresponses via STAT3 and iv) promotion of cytotoxic function of NK cells.\n The significance of our novel, translational approach is underscored by our strong preliminary data, and\na reproducible, human-like model system. The data from the proposed study will be critical to the development\nof an immune-based intervention along with cART and anti-TB therapy to control dysregulated immune\nresponses generated during early events of HIV co-infection of LTBI and provide long-term immune\nreconstitution. This will lead to the future clinical testing of such host-directed therapeutic approaches to control\nTB/HIV co-infection related mortality and morbidities.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "PRC2 independent role of Ezh2 in regulation of basal cell dynamics post-influenza virus infection",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary:\nInfluenza is a major global health threat causing over half a million deaths each year. Certain virulent strains,\nsuch as H1N1, can cause extensive lung damage, leading to dysplastic repair and the formation of Krt5+ basal\ncell pods in the damaged alveolar. Despite their temporary barrier restoration capabilities, these basal cells fall\nshort in facilitating full tissue repair, resulting in the accumulation of dysplastic tissue and compromised lung\nfunction. The abnormal repair process mirrors patterns seen in chronic lung diseases like idiopathic pulmonary\nfibrosis (IPF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), accentuating the urgency to understand the\ncellular and molecular mechanisms governing lung remodeling and repair. Using mouse models exposed to the\ninfluenza A virus strain PR8, we and others have demonstrated that these nascent basal cells predominantly\noriginate from a rare subset of migratory airway cells. Furthermore, we found that Enhancer of Zeste 2 (Ezh2) is\nmarked upregulated in the hyperplastic basal cells post-PR8 infection. Conventionally, Ezh2, as the catalytic\nsubunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), has been recognized for its ability to repress gene\nexpression via the trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3). However, these basal cells post-PR8\ninfection showed lower H3K27me3 levels compared to nearby cell types, aligning with low expression of other\nPRC2 components like Eed. This implies a potential PRC2-independent function for Ezh2 in controlling basal\ncell hyperplasticity. Additionally, Ezh2 deletion in airway epithelial progenitor cells led to marked reduction Krt5+\npod after PR8 infection. Moreover, we also observed a significant upregulation of Sox9 in the hyperplastic basal\ncells post-PR8 infection. Sox9 deletion also led to reduction of the Krt5+ pod area mirroring Ezh2 deletion\nphenotype after PR8 infection. Furthermore, inhibition of Ezh2 resulted in suppressed Sox9 expression in basal\ncells both in vivo and in vitro, suggested Ezh2 may serve as a transcription activator for Sox9. Based on these\ndata, our central hypothesis is that Ezh2 functions in a PRC2-independent manner to regulate basal cell\ndynamics post-PR8 infection. In Aim 1, we will investigate whether the phosphorylation-mediated non-canonical\nrole of Ezh2 plays a regulatory function in basal cell dynamics following PR8 infection. In Aim2, we will identify\nthe unique gene targets of non-canonical Ezh2 and ascertain whether Sox9 serves as an integral downstream\neffector in basal cells post-PR8 infection. In Aim3, discern the interacting partners external to the PRC2 complex\nwith which Ezh2 associates to exert its non-canonical role in basal cells post-PR8 infection. Additionally, we seek\nto identify the factors that initiate these interactions and changes. Completion of these aims will provide\ntransformative insights into the mechanisms underpinning lung tissue remodeling post-influenza and the broader\nimplications for pulmonary medicine.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT: Pre-existing T cell responses have been correlated with decreased disease severity and positive\nclinical outcomes during the influenza pandemic of 2009 and the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore,\ndiversifying T cell responses, particularly targeting conserved internal viral proteins such as the influenza virus\nnucleoprotein (NP), could confer protection against both epidemic and pandemic strains of influenza A virus\n(IAV). We have designed a mosaic nucleoprotein (MNP) composed of 9-mer epitopes derived from the complete\nset of 7,422 NP sequences from human, swine, and avian IAVs. We have strong evidence that a vaccine\nformulation consisting of MNP and a combination adjuvant (Adjuplex + TLR-4 agonist glucopyranosyl lipid A\n[GLA]) elicits T cell responses that protect against epidemic and pandemic strains of influenza A virus in mice.\nAvian influenza viruses have decimated poultry in the US and many parts of the world, and most concerningly,\nthese viruses have spilled over to infect multiple mammalian species, including cats and cows. Most notably, the\nH5N1 avian influenza virus in cows is rapidly spreading to multiple states in the US. Currently, there is serious\nconcern about the possibility of the rapidly spreading avian influenza virus in cows mutating to gain the potential\nto infect humans, cause severe disease, and efficiently spread by airborne transmission. Therefore, it is critical\nto develop vaccine strategies to protect humans, and contain avian influenza virus infection and transmission in\ncows. Significantly, the MNP we generated exhibits close homology to the NP of the H5N1 virus affecting dairy\ncows in the ongoing outbreak. We hypothesize that the MNP will be immunogenic and that T cell responses\nelicited by the MNP-based vaccine will provide effective protection against the currently circulating strains of\navian influenza virus isolated from cows.\nThe aims of this administrative supplement are: (1) Test the hypothesis that mosaic nucleoprotein (MNP)\nformulated in the combination adjuvants (Adjuplex+GLA or Adjuplex+CdN) will elicit diverse antibody and T cell\nresponses in circulation and mammary gland of ferrets and cows; (2) Test the hypothesis that mosaic\nnucleoprotein (MNP) formulated in the combination adjuvants (Adjuplex+GLA or Adjuplex+CdN) will protect\nferrets against H5N1 in lungs, upper respiratory tract, and the mammary gland. The proposed studies will have\nimplications in the development of effective vaccines to protect humans against avian influenza, break the\ntransmission cycle in cows and mitigate spillover into humans.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Pre-Clinical Evaluation of IRE1beta as a Novel Therapeutic Target for Cystic Fibrosis Airway Mucus Production",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) lungs exhibit mucoinflammatory responses soon after birth, likely triggered by viral\ninfections and/or aspiration. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes bronchiolitis leading to airway muco-\nobstruction in young CF children, who exhibit increases in MUC5B and MUC5AC mucins in their airways.\nBecause no treatments are available for CF airway mucus overproduction, there is a clear unmet medical need\nfor therapies that target mucin synthesis in CF airways. CF airway epithelial inflammation triggers endoplasmic\nreticulum (ER) stress and activates the inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), which exists in two isoforms, \u03b1 and\n\u03b2. IRE1\u03b1 is ubiquitous, but IRE1\u03b2 is only expressed in mucous cells of the respiratory and GI tracts. We have\nshown that IRE1\u03b2 (but not IRE1\u03b1) is required for airway mucin production. IRE1 is an ER transmembrane protein\nwith a lumenal domain (sensor of unfolded proteins) and a cytoplasmic domain (effector) with kinase and RNase\nactivities. It is unknown whether the IRE1\uf062 lumenal domain senses unfolded mucins and whether its cytoplasmic\ndomains mediate mucin production; however, our previous studies suggested that mucin production triggers ER\nstress and activates IRE1\u03b2 kinase-induced RNase activation. Because the activated IRE1\uf062 RNase splices the\nmRNA of X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1s), a transcription factor that up-regulates mucin production, this may\nprovide a mechanism for CF airway epithelial mucin overproduction. In non-mucous cells, IRE1\uf061 kinase activates\nJNK, p38 MAP kinase and NF-\uf06bB via protein interactions, but it is unknown whether the IRE1\uf062 kinase activates\nthese pathways, which are relevant to CF airways because they can promote mucin production. Our preliminary\ndata indicate that IRE1\u03b2, MUC5AC and MUC5B levels are up-regulated in native CF human airways and in\nfreshly isolated CF human distal airway epithelia. Over-expression of wild type IRE1\uf062 in primary human bronchial\nepithelia (HBE) increased mucin production, whereas over-expression of IRE1\uf062 mutants that lack kinase and/or\nRNase activities decreased mucin production. IL-1\uf062 and TNF\uf061, predominant CF airway cytokines, differently\naffected XBP-1s (only IL-1\uf062 increased XBP-1s) and mucin production (IL-1\uf062 > TNF\uf061) in HBE, suggesting that\nthey up-regulate mucin production via IRE1\u03b2 RNase-dependent and independent mechanisms. KIRA6, an IRE1\nkinase + RNase inhibitor, blunted IL-1\uf062-increased XBP-1s and mucins in CF HBE. Notably, a combination of\nCFTR modulators (VX-445, VX-661 and VX-770) had no effect on mucin production. RSV infection of HBE\nincreased XBP-1s and mucin production/secretion, and these responses were blunted by KIRA6. Finally, murine\nparainfluenza virus type 1-infected mice developed viral bronchiolitis and airway muco-obstruction, modeling the\nbronchiolitis in CF infants infected by RSV. Our aims will test the role of IRE1\u03b2 protein domains in CF airway\ncytokine-increased mucin production in CF HBE. We will also evaluate the therapeutic effect of IRE1\u03b2 inhibition\non respiratory virus infection-induced mucin production in CF HBE and murine airways, including a CF mouse.\nOur studies may lead to the generation of IRE1\u03b2 inhibitors as novel therapeutics for CF airway muco-obstruction.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract:\nSeasonal influenza causes a significant burden of disease in low-middle income countries, specifically in some\nof the most vulnerable populations such as infants, pregnant women, and the elderly. Influenza spreads\nprimarily within households and while this has been extensively studied in the high-income countries, there\nremains a significant gap in the literature around household transmission of influenza in low-middle income\ncountries. Differences in population structure, household membership, vaccine availability, and contact\npatterns make it difficult to apply knowledge from high to low-middle income countries. Understanding\nhousehold transmission of influenza in this setting will help to generate key epidemiologic parameters of\ninfluenza such as secondary attack rate and help to model potential interventions to decrease transmission.\nThis K23 offers an outstanding opportunity to leverage respiratory and serologic samples from a household-\nbased cohort with self-reported and sensor-based social contact data who were followed prospectively for any\nrespiratory illness in three low-middle income countries: Guatemala, Mozamique, India. Our approach will be to\nuse established molecular techniques including hemagglutination inhibition assay and RT-PCR to calculate\nseroprevalence curves, the force of infection, and with-in household secondary attack rates. We will the\ndevelop a heterogenous chain binomial model of within household transmission by incorporating household\ncontact data and risk of infectious between pairs of individuals in the household. Aim 1 is to quantify the spread\nof with-in household transmission of influenza. Aim 2 is to develop a heterogenous chain binomial model of\nwithin household transmission with the hopes of projecting how effective different interventions such as\nvaccination and masking are in mitigating intra-household influenza transmission. To complete this project, I\nwill require additional training in infectious disease modeling, advanced methods in infectious disease\nquantification, influenza epidemiology and emerging infectious diseases. To help ensure this projects success,\nI am surrounded an international team of experts in influenza epidemiology and infectious disease modeling\nwith whom I have established relationships. This K23 award would provide the crucial link in my career from\nhaving a foundation in infectious disease epidemiology to having an expertise in infectious disease modeling.\nAt the end of this award period, I will be prepared to submit a strong NIH R01 application focused on modeling\nemerging infectious diseases transmission in low-resource settings.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nWith recent advances in structural biology and supercomputing technology, all-atom molecular dynamics\n(MD) simulation technique has gained momentum as a prominent tool for the study of protein structural\ndynamics. Brute-force MD, however, is not capable of adequately sampling most functionally relevant\nbiomolecular processes such as large-scale protein conformational changes. Various approaches have been\ndeveloped over the last three decades to address the \u201ctimescale gap\u201d that hinders the use of MD in real-\nworld applications. Free energy calculation methods, enhanced sampling techniques, and path-finding\nalgorithms are examples of umbrella terms that describe many of these methods. This project specifically\naims at employing, tailoring, and fine-tuning state-of-the-art enhanced sampling and path-finding\nalgorithms to address important biological and biomedical questions. The overall aim of this project is to\ndevelop and employ robust and practical sampling and analysis protocols to study functionally relevant\nconformational changes of various proteins from fibroblast growth factor to coronavirus spike protein. Our\nproposed methodological framework specifically takes advantage of (1) robust theoretical formalisms\nrooted in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and differential geometry; (2) system-specific enhanced\nsampling protocols that are tunable for the specific problem at hand; and (3) and integrative and synergistic\napproach to experimental (specifically smFRET) and computational (specifically MD) techniques. Some\nof the systems proposed to be studied here include proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters, influenza\nhemagglutinin, ATP-binding transporters, coronavirus spike proteins, mechanosensitive channel of large\nconductance, membrane insertase YidC, serotonin transporter, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) protein.\nThe common theme in all of these projects is the large-scale conformational changes involved in the\nfunction of these proteins. The successful use of the methodology proposed in this project will allow the\ncharacterization of these conformational changes at the molecular level and pave the groundwork for the\nroutine application of state-of-the-art enhanced sampling techniques in the study of real world biological\nproblems.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nRespiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) causes a substantial burden of hospitalizations and deaths among older\nadults, comparable to that of influenza. The new and effective RSV vaccines have the potential to dramatically\nreduce RSV morbidity and mortality, yet their full public health impact will not be realized if the racial and ethnic\ndisparities in RSV vaccine uptake mirror those observed in other respiratory virus-vaccines, from COVID-19 to\ninfluenza. We have the opportunity to adapt community-based interventions from the COVID-19 pandemic to\nproactively address disparities in RSV vaccine uptake. However, evidence-based data, conducted in\npartnership with impacted communities, are essential.\nThis project will focus on increasing RSV vaccine uptake among Latinos, a community disproportionatly\naffected by respiratory vaccines and RSV. We will leverage our well-established community-academic\npartnership, Unidos en Salud, to adapt two components of our \u2018Motivate, Vaccinate, Activate\u2019 intervention\u2014\nCHW counseling and text message nudges. This multi-component intervention was originally designed to\nincrease COVID-19 vaccine uptake among Latinos and to activate people to recommend vaccination to people\nin one\u2019s social network. Our overall study objective is to adapt this intervention to inform effective and\ncustomizable community-based strategies to increase RSV vaccine uptake. In addition to a rigorous\nrandomized trial design, we will collect detailed implementation outcomes to aide in generalizability and\nadaption to other vaccines and settings. Our primary hypothesis is that language-and culturally-concordant\nCHW motivation and activation counseling sessions, coupled with text message nudges, will increase RSV\nvaccine confidence by adressing trust, knowledge, and access-related barriers. The proposed study has three\naims. In Aim 1 we will use the ADAPT-IT framework to adapt two intervention components: CHW counseling\nand text-message nudges to increase RSV vaccine uptake among Latino older adults (>60 years) (Aim 1a)\nand enable younger adults (18-50 years old) to discuss RSV vaccination with older adults in their social and\nfamily networks (Aim 1b). Then in Aim 2 we will conduct a two-arm type-1 effectiveness implementation trial to\ndetermine the effectiveness and implementation of a CHW counseling and text-message intervention on RSV\nvaccine uptake in Latino adults >60 years. In Aim 3, using a parallel trial design and social network analytic\ntechniques, we will test the effectiveness of CHW counseling and text-message nudges on activating Latino\nadults to discuss RSV vaccination with the older adults within their social networks.\nThe proposed work will provide timely, rigorous, and adaptable data to directly inform community-based\napproaches to increase RSV vaccination. In addition to providing timely data to reduce RSV vaccine\ndisparities, these data will also advance our scientific understanding of the effectiveness of text-messages from\ncommunity-based organizations and community-based interventions aimed at activating cross-generational\nsocial networks to boost vaccine uptake.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nPseudomonas aeruginosa is a major respiratory pathogen in the pathogenesis of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and the\nineffective immune response to this pathogen is thought to cause the majority of the lung damage characteristic\nof this disease. In the later stages of CF, P. aeruginosa reside in biofilm communities in the lung, accounting for\ntheir resistance to antibiotic therapies. To date, little is known about host factors that promote the transition of P.\naeruginosa from acute to chronic infection in CF. CF patients show a reduced ability to clear P. aeruginosa\nacquired during respiratory viral infections and frequently new pseudomonal colonization in people with CF\nfollows a respiratory viral infection. We have shown that virus co-infection, and the subsequent antiviral interferon\nresponse, promote biofilm conversion by P. aeruginosa. Interferon has potent antiviral activity, but in addition,\ninterferon stimulated gene (ISG) effector functions have been reported to promote pathogen replication,\nsuggesting that pathogens have evolved to subvert and even benefit from the interferon response. Decades of\nresearch demonstrate metabolic reprogramming as part of the host response to acute viral infections, with\ninduction of aerobic glycolysis being a common observation. Our preliminary data suggest that the innate antiviral\nimmune response through IFN signaling induces aerobic glycolysis during RSV infection, while still maintaining\noxidative phosphorylation in the respiratory epithelium. Using an improved model to culture P. aeruginosa\nbiofilms in association with human CF airway epithelial cells and a RSV mouse infection model, we will examine\nmechanisms by which antiviral interferon signaling promotes biofilm conversion by P. aeruginosa through a\nmechanism of metabolic reprogramming. To this end, we will determine how metabolic reprogramming of the\nrespiratory epithelium facilitates viral-bacterial co-infection, define how secreted metabolic products from the\nvirus-infected respiratory epithelium promote P. aeruginosa persistence and chronic infection by impairing\nantibacterial function in recruited macrophages and promoting bacterial biofilm growth. Our goal is to elucidate\nthe molecular mechanism for virus-stimulated bacterial biofilms and thus, identify new targets that could delay\nacquisition and chronic bacterial colonization, or work in conjunction with existing therapies, to eradicate P.\naeruginosa in CF patients.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "The COVID-19 pandemic has presented new challenges to individuals world-wide. Since the first reports of\ninfections in the US more than 90 million individuals have become infected and more than 1 million have died.\nSARS-CoV-2 genome has various open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs), 4\nstructural proteins and several accessory proteins. The genome of RNA virus can easily generate mutations as\nvirus spreads. The constant emergence of new mutations in SARS-CoV-2 is the major challenge for the ongoing\ndevelopment of antiviral drug and broad neutralizing antibodies. The two mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech\nand Moderna are moderate effective, 45 to 75 percent at protecting people from in preventing infection from the\ndelta variant, and both of them have received emergency use authorization. More seriously, the omicron variant\nwas first detected in southern Africa and quickly expanded to the whole world. According to a recent study,\ntraditional dosing regimens of COVID-19 vaccines available in the US do not produce antibodies capable of\nrecognizing and neutralizing the Omicron variant. The global data shows the coronavirus pandemic is far from\nover. Thus, more variants are expectable and some of them may escape the immune response produced after\nvaccination. How to keep the efficacy of existing mRNA vaccines on variants is challenging us. Aside from SARS-\nCoV-2, mRNA medicines against cancer and other infectious disease, such as Ebola, Zika virus, and influenza,\nare advancing through clinical trials.\n The goal of this project is to develop an integrated deep learning model to optimize 5'UTR, codon usage, and\n3'UTR at same time that enables users to design the optimal mRNA sequence to enhance protein expression\nlevel, thus to improve the efficacy of mRNA medicines. mRNA medicines hold great promise for the treatment of\na wide variety of disease, extending from prophylactics to therapeutics for infectious diseases, cancer, and\ngenetic disease. mRNA medicines have several beneficial features: safety, efficacy, production, and speed.\nMultiple factors are involved to regulate the stability and efficiency of mRNA, including 5' untranslated region\n(UTR), 3' UTR, codon et al, and several in silico approaches have being developed to optimize these factors\nrespectively However, as these factors always function together during the translation of mRNA, and individual\noptimization is insufficient. Thus, a novel integrated deep learning model for these factors is needed to\ncomprehensively enhance the stability and efficiency of mRNA medicine. In silico optimization of mRNA vaccine\nprovides a fast methodology to investigate all possible integration of the ORF, 5' UTR and 3'UTR and identify\nthe optimal mRNA vaccine. The interdisciplinary team proposed to develop the following aims: (1) developing\ndeep learning models for 5' UTR, codon, and 3' UTR respectively, and integrated model for systemic optimization\nof 5' UTR, codon, and 3' UTR; and (2) experimentally validate the integrated models by designing the 5'UTR,\ncodon, and 3'UTR sequence for representative.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (NHL/CLL) patients have immune system deficits\nthat arise from the cancer and are aggravated by lymphoma therapies, placing them at higher risk of morbidity\nand mortality after infection with viruses like influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\n(SARS-CoV-2). Patients are strongly recommended to get vaccinated and boosted with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA\nvaccines, but antibody responses after vaccination in these patients are often impaired. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines\nalso elicit T cell responses in healthy individuals that may be protective but previous studies indicate that T cells\nfrom NHL/CLL patients are also dysfunctional.\nUnder the mentorship of Drs. Rafi Ahmed and Jonathon Cohen, I have assembled a cohort of over 600 NHL/CLL\npatients with over 1,300 longitudinal blood samples paired with clinical data that I have used to study the immune\nresponses in this patient population. Using this cohort, I showed that most patients have lower antibody\nresponses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination than otherwise healthy individuals and that antibody responses\ncorrelate at least partly with lymphoma therapies. I have also shown that some patients produce spike-specific\nCD4+ and CD8+ T cells after vaccination. The longitudinal, antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses\nafter vaccination and infection have not been well characterized in NHL/CLL patients. I hypothesize that these\npatients have alterations in their CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses after antigen stimulation, which are dependent\non the underlying lymphoma subtype and lymphoma therapy.\nThis proposal has 3 goals: 1) To evaluate the generation, differentiation, breadth, and persistence of SARS-\nCoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell responses in NHL/CLL patients after vaccination and infection using functional\nassays and single cell sequencing technologies; 2) To define the primary and memory SARS-CoV-2-specific\nCD8+ T cell responses after vaccination and infection through functional assays and single cell sequencing\ntechnologies; and 3) to support my transition from a trainee in Dr. Ahmed\u2019s laboratory to leading an independent\nresearch program.\nSuccessful completion of these studies will provide in-depth knowledge of the generation, evolution, breadth,\nand persistence of antigen-specific T cell responses in NHL/CLL patients after vaccination and infection. This\nknowledge will facilitate the design of interventions that may improve vaccine responses in these and other\nimmunosuppressed patients, protecting them from potentially life-threatening viral infections like SARS-CoV-2\nand influenza. Moreover, the insights on the generation and maintenance of adaptive immune responses against\nnovel antigens obtained from these studies could help fuel the development of better cancer immunotherapies.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nBroadening the spectrum of vaccine platforms that confer protective, durable and broad immunogenicity is\nimportant for pandemic preparedness. Here, we aim to create essential preclinical data to characterize a novel\ngenetic vaccine platform called PARVAX to increase its clinical acceptance. Our previous studies show that a\nsingle dose of PARVAX candidates for COVID-19 elicits sustained humoral immunity, near-sterilizing upper\nand lower airway protection from a SARS-CoV-2 challenge, and potent and durable cellular responses. These\nqualities combined with established commercial and low-cost manufacturing processes, make this platform\nimminently feasible, scalable and affordable for vaccine applications. In this proposal, we will investigate the\nmechanism behind the potency and durability of PARVAX, which we hypothesize is correlated with antigen\nexpression kinetics (Aim 1). We also use rational engineering approaches to enhance the potency of the\nPARVAX platform, which will enhance safety and applicability for other pathogens (Aim 2). Finally, we propose\nto generate proof of the potency of PARVAX as a vaccine platform beyond COVID-19 by exploring the serum\nand mucosal immunity and protection from influenza viruses in two preclinical models of influenza infection\n(Aim 3). The proposed work is highly relevant for pandemic preparedness, since it will enable the rapid design\nof new and preclinically derisked PARVAX candidates for existing and future pathogens, and has the potential\nto provide clarity on the means to improve the durability, breadth and mucosal immunity of other platforms.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\n Diversifying the biomedical workforce is a priority of the US government scientific funding agencies. To\nfulfill these priorities, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other minority serving institutions\nhave continued to play an outsized role in training underrepresented minority (URM) students. Specifically,\nMeharry Medical College (MMC) has been a leader in training URM students in basic, translational, and clinical\nresearch. Our graduate, medical and dental students are often first-generation college students, and first from\ntheir community to pursue training in biomedical research. Importantly, our trainees are role models for the next\ngeneration and often mentor and educate URM students post-graduation. Consistent with our history of providing\ncare to the underserved since 1876, MMC is playing a vital role in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. As\nevident with other infectious diseases, COVID-19 disproportionally affects minority health, specifically African\nAmericans and Hispanics. A key strategy to combat these evolving pathogens is to train the next generation of\nvirologists from diverse backgrounds. The urgent need for a diverse workforce in virology is acutely felt during\nthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that has ravaged the World and disproportionately affected the minority\npopulation in the US. Furthermore, increasing the number of virologists from URM backgrounds is also critical\nto fight against deadly diseases caused by viruses such as HIV, Influenza, Ebola, and others. To address this\nunmet need, we propose the \u201cEnhancing Virology Training (ENVIT) through Summer Research\u201d program.\nThe goal of this program is to prepare and increase the number of URM students in virology-focused\ncareers. This 10-week program will provide an intensive research experience for graduate, medical and dental\nstudents. A local, regional, and nationwide recruitment strategy will be employed to attract URM students. We\nwill provide classroom teaching and hands-on laboratory training in basic virology, lectures/seminars on career-\ndevelopment, scientific writing, communications skills and networking. Each student will work under the\nmentorship of a faculty mentor from Meharry Medical College (MMC) and/or Vanderbilt University Medical Center\n(VUMC) on a research project that focused on virology. The participants will attend seminars that allow\ninteractions with virologists and expose students to career opportunities in virology. The program will end with a\none-day Virology Mini-Symposium where students will showcase their research. This mini-symposium will also\nfeature a keynote lecture from a national/international leader from the virology field. Finally, the ENVIT program\nwill track the career path of participants to evaluate the extent to which program goals were met, and identify\nareas for improvement. Evaluations from research mentors will also be used to assess and improve the program.\nThese focused research experiences and career development activities will meaningfully increase engagement\nof URM students in the area of virology and diversify the biomedical workforce specifically needed to fight the\nexisting and emerging viral pathogens.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "The innate antiviral response in airway epithelium: a cell type-resolved, functional genomics approach",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nBeyond its role in conducting the air required for respiration, the airway epithelium plays a critical role in host\ndefense through its physical and immunological properties. Specialized secretory cells present in the epithelium\nsecrete airway mucins, which form a viscous hydrogel protecting the epithelial surface, and the coordinated\nbeating of multiciliated cells propels this surface liquid and trapped foreign material away from the lower airways.\nTP63+ airway basal cells serve as the progenitor cell to replenish all other epithelial cell populations. Additional\nrare cell types with as-of-yet incompletely defined functions include FOXI1+ ionocytes and POU2F3+ tuft-like\ncells. All epithelial cell types constitute a selectively permeable physical barrier by forming cell-cell junctions with\nneighboring cells, such that an electrochemical gradient can be maintained across epithelial boundary. Besides\nthese physical functions, airway epithelial cells participate in both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms\nthrough pathogen sensing, release of cytokines, and crosstalk with immune cells. The type I interferon (IFN-I)\nresponse is a broad-spectrum, first-line innate immune defense against viruses. While traditionally viewed as\nrelatively uniform across cell types, preliminary data from our lab and collaborators show that IFN-I induces\ndistinct gene expression programs across airway cell types, hinting at possible functional heterogeneity in the\nIFN-I response on a per-cell type basis. However, it is unclear whether these altered gene expression patterns\nand associated transcriptional regulators have functional significance in the context of respiratory virus infection.\nA diverse group of respiratory viruses infect the airway epithelium, including influenza viruses, rhinoviruses,\n\u201ccommon-cold\u201d coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2. These can be important triggers for acute exacerbations of\nchronic airway disease states. The proposed project will develop state-of-the-art CRISPRa/i functional genomics\napproaches to perturb IFN-induced regulators and effectors of innate immunity in a human, physiologically\nrelevant model of the human airway epithelium. This will enable precise functional profiling of the IFN-I response\nin individual airway epithelial cell types. Altogether, this work will shed light on how the airway epithelium functions\nas an integrated unit to mediate host defense against respiratory viruses and strike a balance between effective\nhost defense and immune homeostasis (using influenza A virus as a clinically relevant model respiratory\npathogen), with the ultimate goal of developing novel host-directed antiviral therapeutic strategies. More\ngenerally, I anticipate the proposed experimental system developed here will be broadly valuable for precise\ngenetic characterization of other airway disease states and their interaction with respiratory virus infection,\nincluding COPD, cystic fibrosis, and asthma. This project also presents a unique opportunity for training in both\nexperimental and computational research approaches relevant to airway biology and respiratory virus infection.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Respiratory viral infections (RVI) have changed the world. RVI are a leading cause of infectious morbidity and\nmortality in children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and solid organ transplantation (SOT).\nRVI diagnosis by qualitative PCR screening is sensitive, but unfortunately does not distinguish disease from\npresence of viral nucleic acid or predict risk for progression from upper to the more severe lower respiratory tract\ndisease (LRTD). In the COVID-19 era, many centers now use pre-transplant RVI screening, but the implications\nof detection in an asymptomatic host are unknown. Integrating quantitative viral load, viral sequencing, and/or\nhost immune (T cell and antibody) responses could provide novel predictive tools to stratify the risk of developing\nan RVI and the progression to LRTD. Our objective is to establish a comprehensive RVI diagnostic and disease\nprogression predictive model in children undergoing transplantation. We propose a prospective multi-center\nepidemiologic study of 2000 pediatric transplant recipients, with a nested case-control immunologic and virologic\nsubstudy. This will be the largest study on RVI in any age group of HCT and SOT recipients. We will leverage\nthe Pediatric Transplant ID Network (PIDTRAN), a consortium of 21 nationwide sites and the only group\ndedicated to pediatric transplant infectious diseases. We will obtain pre-transplant blood and nasal samples in\nall 2000 transplant participants at enrollment and also blood at day +100 post-transplant. In Aim 1, we will\ndetermine the prevalence of viral nucleic assay positivity using qualitative PCR and then perform quantitative\nPCR (qPCR) and viral sequencing (metagenomics) on positive specimens. We hypothesize that the quantity of\nrespiratory viral nucleic acid or certain viral genotypes will identify patients at risk for RVI or disease progression.\nIn Aim 2, we will develop and validate an immunological classifier to predict risk of RVI and progression to LRTD\nin a nested substudy focused on three major pediatric viruses: RSV, parainfluenza virus 3, and human\nmetapneumovirus. We will characterize pre-transplant humoral and cellular immune responses in the subset of\npatients who develop those RVIs compared with pre-transplant immunologic and day +100 post-transplant\nimmune responses from uninfected matched controls. The combination of host response and virologic data\n(qPCR and viral metagenomics) will also be compared between RVI cases who do or do not progress to LRTD\nto identify biomarkers. We hypothesize that patients with specific qualitative or quantitative antibody responses\nand/or specific T cell repertoires to RVI will have superior clinical outcomes. Characterizing a comprehensive\nviral and host response pre-transplant, we will learn to predict who is at risk of RVI and LRTD and needs early\nintervention vs. delay of transplant, and when PCR positivity is indicative of potential disease.

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Mechanisms of regulatory T-cell mediated endothelial repair following viral pneumonia in aged hosts",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nThe broad objectives of this K08 proposal are two-fold: 1) to facilitate development of the necessary skills that\nwill allow the candidate to achieve her long-term goal of becoming a successful physician-scientist focusing on\ndeterminants of recovery from viral pneumonia in aged hosts, and 2) to investigate the mechanisms that direct\nthe Tregs to orchestrate resolution of severe lung injury throughout the lifespan. The candidate and her mentors\nhave designed a detailed training plan tailored to the candidate's specific needs and goals. The plan includes a\nrigorous research component that will afford the PI new knowledge and research skills to better examine the\nlinks between a critical immune cell population and the endothelium during recovery from viral pneumonia. The\nproposal concerns viral pneumonia, specifically influenza-induced lung injury, its clinical counterpart the acute\nrespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and how they both disproportionately affect the elderly population. Despite\ndecades of dedicated research, there are only a few anti-viral therapies with limited efficacy to manage severe\nviral pneumonia. Tregs have been shown to decrease inflammation and promote tissue repair in diverse murine\nmodels of lung injury. Tregs also increase in the lungs of patients with ARDS, suggesting that they may play a\nrole in the human adaptive immune response to lung injury. However, the specific mechanisms that cause Tregs\nto execute their pro-repair program following lung injury remain unknown. Our preliminary data shows that the\nyouthful reparative Treg cell program following influenza-induced lung injury is dominated by biologic processes\nlinked to the development and repair of blood capillaries. This reparative program is lost in aged hosts in a cell-\nautonomous manner. Thus, we hypothesize that aging results in Treg cell-specific downregulation of important\npro-angiogenic factors expression such as VEGFA, leading to impaired alveolar endothelial repair and recovery\nfrom viral pneumonia. The long-term goal of the proposal is to identify novel small molecule- and cell-based\ntherapeutics to control inflammation and promote tissue repair in our increasingly older population. To test this\nhypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) determine whether age-related alterations in the pro-\nendothelial repair function of Tregs results from cell-autonomous or microenvironmentally-driven changes, 2)\ndetermine whether Treg cell-generated VEFGA is necessary and sufficient to restore the pro-endothelial repair\nfunction present in youth that is lost with aging, and 3) determine whether age-related VEGFA expression in\nalveolar Tregs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is associated with 30-day mortality in patients with severe viral\npneumonia. We will use standard techniques to assess severity of lung injury, endothelial repair, heterochronic\n(age mis-matched) adoptive Treg cell transfer, multiple transgenic murine strains for loss-of-function and gain-\nof-function experiments, flow cytometry, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and transcriptional profiling with\nRNA-sequencing as the primary methods to support the experimental design of this proposal.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "SUMMARY\nViral Immunity and Vaccination (VIVA) Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) will carry out a\ncomprehensive program for assessing the dynamic human immune responses to vaccination. The VIVA HIPC\nwill leverage recent advances in human immune profiling methods to characterize the diverse states of the\nhuman innate immune system before and after vaccination against these infectious diseases using novel\nimmune phenotyping and genomics strategies that generate data and tools to be used for downstream data\nanalysis and functional investigations. We will generate human immune profiles and signatures for vaccinations\nagainst SARS-CoV-2 (Project 1), seasonal influenza (Project 2) and dengue viruses (Project 3). We will use\nholistic approaches to provide cutting-edge standardized and qualified `omics' assays to assess cellular and\nserological Immune responses to vaccinations, genomics/transcriptomics, including scRNAseq, CITEseq and\nspatial tissue transcriptomics, and experimental vaccinations in primary human tonsillar histocultures in Projects\n1, 2 and 3. We will perform data mining, bioinformatics analyses across data sets, and modeling for integration\nof the `omics' datasets to identify the network components and infer their interactions and correlations important\nfor outcomes. The VIVA HIPC will make the data available for use by the research community and provide the\nanalyses and immune profiles generated to the scientific community. We will couple our local data infrastructure\nto ImmPort to ensure full and timely release of clinical, sample, and experimental meta-data in synchrony with\ngenomic data releases to standard data repositories. The multi-disciplinary team of investigators with\ncomplementary expertise in viral immunology, viral pathogenesis, vaccinology, genomics and data analysis, will\nensure the success of the VIVA program.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nEvery winter, seasonal influenza infects over 10,000,000 US children, hospitalizes 50,000, and kills 300\u2010500.\nBlack children are 2\u20103 times more likely to get sick, be hospitalized, and die than children of other races and\nethnicities. These disparities are associated with influenza vaccination disparities, which are in turn associated\nwith historical exploitation, access to care, health illiteracy, and vaccine hesitancy. The long\u2010term objective of\nthe candidate, Joshua T.B. Williams, MD, is to reduce vaccination disparities by partnering with minority\nstakeholders to co\u2010create interventions that improve vaccination equity in pragmatic trials. This objective will\nfurther the mission of the National Institutes of Child Health and Development to ensure all children have an\nequitable chance to grow and fulfill their potential free from diseases. Dr. Williams is well\u2010suited for this work\nas a general pediatrician with prior health services research training who has received 4 competitive grants\nand first\u2010authored 15 papers on vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, and vaccine\u2010preventable diseases since 2019.\n To achieve this objective, Dr. Williams will pursue formal coursework, mentored experiential training,\nand directed learning in three specific areas: (1) health disparities and disparities research, (2) community\nengagement, and (3) implementation science, including the design and conduct of pragmatic trials. To support\nhim, Dr. Williams has identified a primary mentor with national expertise in vaccine hesitancy, intervention\ndesign, and pragmatic vaccination trials (Dr. Sean T. O'Leary). He has assembled a team of three co\u2010mentors\nwith expertise in health disparities (Dr. Romana Hasnain\u2010Wynia), community engagement (Dr. Donald\nNease), and implementation science (Dr. Amy Huebschmann). Moreover, he has an established partnership\nwith the Center for African American Health (Ms. Deidre Johnson) and support from 6 other distinguished\nexperts. Dr. Williams proposes 3 sequential projects that build upon his training goals and prior work, which\nuncovered a stakeholder recommendation to improve vaccination confidence through personal stories.\n Digital stories are personal narratives that synthesize images, video, voice, or text to create compelling\naccounts of human experience. In pilot pragmatic trials, digital stories have improved hypertension control in\nBlack adults and increased self\u2010report of Human Papillomavirus vaccination in Korean women. The 3 specific\naims of this proposal are to (1) explore diverse stakeholders' perceptions of and priorities for a digital\nstorytelling intervention through qualitative interviews, (2) co\u2010create a digital storytelling pediatric influenza\nvaccination intervention through novel community\u2010engaged methods, and (3) assess the feasibility,\nacceptability, appropriateness, and pilot effectiveness of the intervention in a pragmatic trial involving 200\nBlack parent\u2010child dyads in two safety\u2010net clinics in Denver, CO. The outstanding research environment at the\nUniversity of Colorado and Dr. Williams' expert mentorship team will ensure his success, enhance his training,\nand advance our understanding of engagement methods and interventions to promote health equity.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nRespiratory viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality,\naccounting for approximately 2 million deaths per year and an even higher healthcare burden during\npandemics. Individuals over the age of 65 in particular, are susceptible to adverse outcomes during acute\nrespiratory illness. In addition to increased severity of acute disease, aged individuals are at higher risk of\ndeveloping chronic pulmonary sequelae \u2013 termed \u201cpost-acute sequelae of COVID-19\u201d (PASC) in the context of\nSARS-CoV-2 infection. Depending on the study criteria, 27-80% of convalescents have been found to develop\nchronic disease and thus PASC is quickly developing into a major burden on healthcare systems worldwide.\nNotably, this phenomenon is not only limited to SARS-CoV-2 and has been reported following several other\nrespiratory viral infections including influenza, SARS-CoV-1, MERS, RSV and rhinovirus. Increased\nsusceptibility of aged individuals to chronic pulmonary sequelae and adverse long-term outcomes remains a\nconsistent feature across all viruses. However, we have limited insight into the age-associated features\nresponsible for the development and maintenance of chronic pulmonary sequelae following acute viral injury.\nOur lab and others have previously reported persistent dysregulation of immune responses following\nrespiratory viral infections during aging. Long-term maintenance of tissue resident CD8+ memory T- (CD8+ TRM)\ncells was found to contribute to chronic pathology in aged lungs. The molecular mechanisms underlying this\npathological activity were previously unknown, but I now present data that CD8+ TRM cells persisting in aged\nlungs contribute to impaired alveolar regeneration post viral injury. Upon depletion of CD8+ TRM cells in the\npost-acute phase of infection, I observe a reduction in the long-term maintenance of Krt8+ transitional cells \u2013\nan intermediate state adopted by alveolar epithelial type 2 (ATII) cells prior to differentiation into ATI cells.\nCoupled with the observed increase in ATI cells, these data indicate that CD8+ TRM cells impair the complete\ndifferentiation of Krt8+ transitional cells into mature ATI cells, thereby compromising pulmonary function. I also\nfound that CD8+ TRM depletion results in reduced IL-1\u03b2 levels, a cytokine known to regulate Krt8+ transitional\ncell activity. Thus, my overall hypothesis is that CD8+ TRM cells persisting in aged lungs following viral\npneumonia contribute to chronic IL-1\u03b2 release and thus impair Krt8+ transitional cell differentiation to promote\ndysplastic lung repair. To address my hypothesis, I propose to 1) determine the contributions of CD8+ TRM cells\npersisting in aged lungs to impaired alveolar regeneration and 2) elucidate the pathological mechanisms driven\nby CD8+ TRM cells to promote dysplastic repair of aged lungs. Understanding this immune-epithelial progenitor\ninteraction would deepen our fundamental understanding of the role of the immune system in alveolar\nregeneration and lung repair. Moreover, the proposed studies would pave the way for developing therapeutic\nstrategies to promote functional repair of aged lungs following severe viral pneumonia.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nLymphatic vessels are a critical component of the immune response to pathogens because they transport\nleukocytes carrying antigens to lymph nodes (LNs) to facilitate antigen presentation. Now known to actively\nshape the innate and adaptive immune responses, lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) express chemokines and\nreceptors, secrete mediators such as sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and C-C motif ligand 21 (CCL21),\nmodulate dendritic cell (DC) function, and regulate trafficking of immune cells into LNs. Lymphatic dysfunction\nalso plays a significant role in many diseases, yet little is known about how lymphatic dysfunction impacts\nresponse to infection. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) is a G-protein coupled receptor highly\nexpressed on lymphocytes and endothelial cells that is important for angiogenesis, barrier function, and immune\ncell trafficking. Others report decreased S1PR1 on lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) is associated with\nlymphedema and skewed CD4 T cell activation in mice and humans. Our collaborators in the Srinivasan lab\ndiscovered that mice lacking S1PR1 on LECs (S1pr1\u0394LEC mice) have enhanced VEGF receptor 3 (VEGFR3)\nsignaling that, in multiple organs, leads to increased lymphatic vessel density and spontaneous formation of\ntertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs), which are organized accumulations of immune cells that form in non-lymphoid\ntissues with infection or inflammation. The impact that these altered CD4 T cell responses and aberrant TLOs\nfound with deficiency of LEC-expressed S1PR1 have on the immune response to infection is unclear. I\nhypothesize that, in S1pr1\u0394LEC mice with influenza A infection (IAV), increased VEGFR3-mediated\nlymphangiogenesis will enhance the lymphatic CCL21 gradient and increase dendritic cell (DC) migration from\nthe lung to the draining mediastinal lymph node (mLN) and that pulmonary TLO formation will enhance viral\nclearance compared to infected controls, but deficient S1PR1 signaling in LECs will alter mLN architecture and\nimpair generation of B and T lymphocyte memory. To test this, I will infect S1pr1\u0394LEC mice with IAV in the following\naims. In aim 1, I will examine viral clearance, lymphatic branching, pulmonary TLO formation, DC migration from\nthe lungs to the mLN and spleen, and the transcriptome of S1pr1-deficient LECs. To determine whether\nphenotypes in S1pr1\u0394LEC mice are due to excess VEGFR3, I will also perform these studies in S1pr1\u0394LEC mice\nwith a reduced gene dosage of Vegfr3. In aim 2, I will investigate lymphocyte memory responses in S1pr1\u0394LEC\nmice with IAV by quantifying antigen-specific T cells and memory B cells, measuring IAV-specific antibodies,\nexamining mLN architecture, and studying response to challenge IAV infection. Preliminary data from my studies\nshow S1pr1\u0394LEC mice have reduced morbidity, increased pulmonary TLO formation, altered DC migration, and\nimpaired antibody production following IAV infection. The successful completion of these studies will provide\nnovel insight into the interactions of immune cells with the lymphatic endothelium during infection and have\nimplications for development of therapeutics that act on lymphatic pathologies.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Point-of-Care RT-PCR System to Inform COVID-19 and Respiratory Illness Decisions",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\n The ongoing COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlights the need for simple, rapid, and cost-effective\ntesting for respiratory infections at the point-of-care, including physician\u2019s offices, urgent-care settings,\nambulatory procedural centers, and low-resource environments. The need is particularly notable for respiratory\ninfections, such as COVID-19 and influenza, which can present with similar symptoms yet require distinct\nmanagement strategies. With its high sensitivity and specificity, RT-PCR is the gold standard for the molecular\ndiagnosis and differentiation among respiratory pathogens. Traditional RT-PCR workflow requires significant\ncontrol over specimen contents and reaction conditions, with current methods requiring nucleic acid extraction\nprior to amplification and detection. The net result is increased complexity, cost, and/or turnaround time for\ndiagnosis. In this context, we have observed in recent influenza studies that outstanding analytic performance\ncharacteristics can be achieved without RNA extraction, by applying our novel workflow and Adaptive PCR\ntechnology. Unlike traditional RT-PCR, Adaptive RT-PCR incorporates mirror-image L-DNA enantiomers\u2014\nidentical in sequence to PCR primers and targets\u2014that modify cycling conditions to match the biochemical\nsample contents, thus eliminating the need to monitor reaction temperature. The direct monitoring of reaction\nconditions overcomes many of the limitations of traditional PCR, facilitating direct amplification within the original\nspecimen matrix, simplifying instrument design, and enabling single-tube analyses.\n SARS-CoV-2 and influenza are both enveloped RNA viruses, with specimens collected in the same\nmanner (i.e. nasopharyngeal swab) and using the same viral transport medium. Therefore, we hypothesize that\nwe may eliminate RNA extraction for this virus, like we have done for influenza, by performing Adaptive RT-PCR\ndirectly on clinical specimens. We propose to enable a simplified methodology through Adaptive RT-PCR,\ncreating diagnostics for COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens without RNA extraction. As a collaboration\nbetween biomedical engineers and a COVID-19 diagnostic laboratory, we seek to develop a workflow and\ninstrument that are simple-to-use, cost-effective, and suitable for point-of-care settings, tools that can rapidly\ninform treatment and management strategies. To achieve this goal, Aim 1 will evaluate the performance of RT-\nPCR directly \u2013 that is, without RNA extraction \u2013 using both traditional and Adaptive RT-PCR instrumentation.\nAim 2 will develop multiplexed amplification reagents to create a sensitive and specific respiratory panel that\ndetects SARS-CoV-2, four other viruses, two bacteria, and one control target. Ultimately, Aim 3 will design and\nfabricate a self-contained Adaptive RT-PCR instrument suitable for point-of-care settings, while validating this\nsystem using characterized human specimens in a CLIA-accredited lab environment. Completion of this project\nwill result in a novel point-of-care tool for both the established and emerging respiratory infections that threaten\npublic health, facilitating rapid treatment, follow-up, infection prevention, and epidemiologic containment.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nNext generation structural biology experiments look to move beyond static observations of structure to a\ndynamic, time-resolved understanding of function. These next-level experiments are enabled by serial\ncrystallography at X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) and microfocus synchrotron beamlines but are limited by\nissues of sample consumption. The long-term goal of this project is to democratize studies of protein structural\ndynamics by developing robust fixed-target mounting strategies for light-, chemical-, and electrically-triggered\ntime-resolved protein crystallography experiments while maximizing sample utilization. This effort leverages the\nexpertise of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the BioCARS facility at the Advanced Photon Source\nfor testing and validation of new mounting strategies. These relationships will also enable rapid translation of\ndeveloped technologies to the larger structural biology community. We have four initial aims to do this:\nAim 1: Develop fixed-target strategies to facilitate the study of macromolecular crystallography targets\nwhile maintaining biological activity. We will design and fabricate X-ray compatible sample holders that\nmaintain the stability of protein crystals over time while also allowing for easy sample loading, robotic handling,\nand in situ spectroscopy. A particular focus will include enabling data collection in a fully anaerobic environment,\nand the technologies developed here will serve as a basis for efforts in subsequent Aims.\nAim 2: Develop fixed-target platforms for photo-triggering of reactions for analysis via time-resolved\nserial crystallography. We will develop X-ray compatible sample holders that take advantage of hydrodynamic\nforces to create large-scale arrays of crystals for use in serial crystallography experiments. The polymer-based\nfabrication strategy will enable fast, low-cost device fabrication, as well as allowing for direct imaging of samples,\nin situ spectroscopy, and laser-based triggering of reactions for time-resolved X-ray crystallography studies.\nAim 3: Develop fixed-target platforms for chemical triggering of reactions for time-resolved serial\ncrystallography analysis. We will develop strategies to enable the controlled addition of a chemical species\n(i.e., substrate, pH change) to enable the chemical triggering of reactions in crystals.\nAim 4: Utilize graphene-based devices to study structural dynamics based on high voltage triggering.\nWe will integrate graphene-based circuitry into our microfluidic devices to enable the use of a voltage-jump as\nboth a general strategy for triggering protein motions and to control electron transfer reactions.\nThe team is well qualified, merging expertise in microfluidics, X-ray science, and structural biology, with an\nestablished history of developing new technology to address challenges within the structural biology community.\nThe impact will be improvements in the ability to perform time-resolved studies of protein structural dynamics\nthat will immediately enhance the research capabilities of a large base of NIH-supported and other researchers.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nLung diseases such as acute lung injuries (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are leading\ncauses of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are traditionally thought of as critical\nnegative regulators of systemic immune responses; however, their local roles in tissues such as the lung are\nbeing increasingly appreciated, where they can promote lung epithelial regeneration in both ALI and ARDS.\nSubsets of tissue-resident Tregs (tTregs) are found to express transcription factors T-bet, Gata3, ROR\uf067t, and\nBcl6, and have enhanced suppression towards their Th1, Th2, Th3/17, and Tfh immune \u2018flavors,\u2019 respectively.\nAlthough tTreg function are beginning to be understood, how lung tTregs are regulated, positioned, and\nmaintained within their respective tissue niches remains unknown. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are\nimmune regulators and have been highlighted to play a role in tTreg biology. Production of IL-33 by a subset of\nMSCs promotes the expansion and maintenance of visceral adipose tissue tTregs and human MSCs can induce\nTregs from conventional CD4+ T cells in vitro. Our group identified a stromal cell niche within the lung where\nadventitial fibroblasts (AFs), an MSC subset, regulate type 2 effector lymphocytes (e.g. ILC2s and Th2 cells), in\npart via the secretion of IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Using 3D thick section imaging, I have\nshown that lung type 2-like tTregs (i.e. Gata3hi ST2+, KLRG1+) also localize to this niche, indicating AFs may\nregulate lung tTregs and their subsets. When co-cultured with lung AFs, lymphoid Tregs significantly increased\nproliferation, survival, and expression of type 2-like Treg markers ST2 and KLRG1 in a contact-dependent\nmanner. Additionally, AFs preferentially support ST2hi Tregs, as evidenced by higher proliferation, survivability,\nand ST2 and KLRG1 expression. Using CellphoneDB V2.0, I identified extracellular matrix (ECM)\u2013integrin\nligand\u2013receptor pairings, such as ICAM, VCAM, and CD49d, that may mediate interactions between AFs and\nTregs. Upon blocking all three in a co-culture system, I found a significant decrease in Treg proliferation and ST2\nand KLRG1 expression. I hypothesize that AFs regulate the maintenance and differentiation of lung Treg subsets,\npreferentially supporting type 2-like lung Tregs, which play critical roles in post-injury lung repair. This proposal\nwill define the topography of type 2 lung tTregs and their role in na\u00efve and inflammatory settings (Aim 1) and\ndetermine the role of adventitial fibroblasts in the regulation of lung Treg subsets (Aim 2). This work utilizes\nmurine models of inflammation, as well as genetic ablations to dissect the local type 2 tTreg response in the lung.\nHigh-dimensional flow cytometry, advanced imaging, and lung function measurements will be used to quantify\nimpacts on immune cells and functional lung recovery. Completion of these aims will elucidate the role of AFs in\nthe function and regulation of lung type 2 tTregs, providing novel mechanistic insight into the role MSCs play in\nregulating immune subsets. Completion of this study provides a foundation for the development of precision\ntherapeutics to selectively regulate lung tissue Tregs subsets to impact the outcome of diverse lung diseases.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract\nNeonates have the highest infection-related mortality of any age group with viral pneumonia\ncausing the majority of these estimated 1 million deaths per year. A majority of neonates in the\nneonatal intensive care unit (NICU) receive empiric antibiotic therapy. This antibiotic exposure\ndysregulates the development of immunity, including influenza-specific CD8+ T cells, although\nexactly how early-life antibiotic exposure affects the formation and function of tissue-resident\nCD8+ T cells is unclear. With their canonical role as adaptive responders to viral infection, CD8+\nT cells are key effector immune cells in both immediate and long-term host defense against\nserious viral pneumonia. It is essential to better define how exactly early-life antibiotic exposure\ndisrupts tissue-resident CD8+ T cell formation and function in order to lessen the substantial\npneumonia-related mortality in neonates. Preliminary flow cytometry data in this proposal shows\nthat early-life antibiotic exposure reduces the formation of influenza-specific CD8+ T cells, which\nleads to higher viral burden and morbidity. Preliminary single cell RNA (scRNA-) and single cell\nAssay for Transposase-accessible Chromatin sequencing (scATACseq) data shows a similar\nreduction in lung CD8+ T cells that is controlled by specific alterations in gene regulatory networks.\nThis data drives the overall hypothesis of this proposal that early-life antibiotic exposure\nleads to a decrease in the formation and functions of tissue-resident CD8+ T cells following\nboth primary and heterotypic Influenza A infection. This proposal will test this hypothesis by\ndetermining the effect of early-life antibiotic exposure on the formation and function of CD8+ T\ncells in the lungs following challenge with Influenza A (Aim 1) and determining regulatory\nmechanisms governing how this early-life antibiotic exposure affects the functions of CD8+ T cells\n(Aim 2). Collectively, this work will provide novel, mechanistic insights into how early-life antibiotic\nexposure is affecting the functions of influenza-specific tissue-resident CD8+ T cells. These Aims\nexpect to show an antibiotic-mediated reduction in CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity, cytokine production,\nand proliferation, as well as changes in specific gene regulatory networks underlying the\nfunctional dysregulation. The candidate driving this proposal is currently an MD/PhD student at\nCincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital in the laboratory of Dr. Hitesh Deshmukh, who will use this proposal\nto set a foundation for an independent career as a physician-scientist. The candidate will use this\nproposal to support his future in the clinic as a pediatric intensivist, where findings from this\nproposal will uncover new strategies leading to better outcomes for the most vulnerable neonates.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nNewly emerging and long-standing infectious challenges, including arboviruses, Ebola virus and pandemic\ncoronaviruses (CoVs), among others, pose serious public health concerns. Additionally, the potential use of\nbiological agents as weapons of mass destruction poses an ongoing threat to humanity. All of these issues\nhave in common the need for development strategies that allow for the rapid design, screening and\nformulation of potential vaccine candidates. We have developed a \u201cdesigner nanoparticle\u201d platform based on\n\u03bb phage-like particles, or nanophages (NPs), that can display multiple antigenic biomolecules alone and in\ncombination in rigorously defined ratios. The NPs can be rapidly modified to screen and evaluate potential\nvaccine candidates against newly emerging threats. Herein we propose to develop tools and technologies for\nrapid screening of multivalent vaccine candidates effective for current and emerging SARS-CoVs and pre-\nemergent SARS-like CoVs. We will engineer \u201csecond generation\u201d nanophages (NPs) that display the spike\nreceptor binding domain (RBD) for these pathogens, the primary target of neutralizing antibody (Ab)\nresponses. Physiochemical and structural characterization of the preparations will be employed to ensure\nthat they possess properties that are appropriate for a pharmaceutical preparation. We will also employ a\nnovel atomic layer deposition technology to generate thermostable, timed-release, single-shot vaccine\nformulations that reduce or eliminate onerous \u201ccold-chain\u201d requirements for their distribution. We further\npropose to determine the immunogenicity and protective capacity of mosaic NPs engineered to\nsimultaneously display multiple antigens. These studies will identify vaccine candidates that elicit potent,\ndurable, and broad neutralizing Ab and T cell responses and protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2\nvariants and pre-emergent SARS-like bat CoVs. In addition to developing this powerful platform and\nimplementing novel formulation strategies, these studies will help define mechanisms of immunogenicity and\ndevelop a platform for the rapid engineering of vaccine candidates for existing and untoward emerging\nbiological threats.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Defects in mitochondrial function and subcellular trafficking along neuronal subcompartments are\nhallmarks of genetic and idiopathic Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Neurons rely heavily on proper\nmitochondrial function and localization, as mitochondria play a dual role: buffering calcium and also\nproviding the energy required for synaptic transmission and local translation. Mitochondria maintain\ntheir own extrachromosomal genome and must coordinate gene expression programs with the nuclear\ngenome (mitonuclear coordination) to correctly assemble oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)\ncomplexes that make up the electron transport chain. This coordination is vital for proper cellular\nfunction, as mitonuclear imbalance leads to orphan OXPHOS subunits that can overwhelm proteostasis\npathways. How mitonuclear balance is affected in AD and the collective effects of AD pathology in\nsubcellular transcriptome dynamics \u2014from transcription to degradation and localization\u2014, for both\nnuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded transcripts are unknown. We hypothesize that neuronal\narchitecture predisposes mitochondria located distal to the soma to mitonuclear imbalance, making\nthem prone to malfunction in neurodegenerative disease states. Recently, we developed a technique\n(subcellular TimeLapse-seq: STLseq) that simultaneously quantifies the kinetic rates of transcription,\nnuclear export, ribosome association, and degradation for each transcript, a process we refer to as\nRNA-flow. This method combines RNA metabolic labeling and subcellular fractionation with Bayesian\nmodeling and has been adapted to capture mitochondrial-encoded genes, enabling quantitative\nanalysis of mitochondrial transcriptome dynamics and of mitonuclear co-regulation. Here, we will\nanalyze RNA-flow dynamics in AD by adapting STL-seq to neurons harboring AD-related mutations,\ncombined with the isolation of soma and neuronal projections. The overall goal of this proposal is to\ndetermine the effects of AD in subcellular transcriptome dynamics and in mitonuclear coordination in\nthe soma and neuronal projections. In Specific Aim 1, we will use STL-seq to analyze the subcellular\ntranscriptome dynamics in AD and identify key regulatory factors. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine\nthe soma and neurites translatome, the mitonuclear coordination differences in soma and neuronal\nprojections, and how AD influences mitonuclear balance. The expected outcome from this grant will be\nan understanding of AD pathology at the transcriptome, the translatome, and the mitonuclear\ncoordination levels in the soma and neuronal projections. These results will positively impact our\nunderstanding of mitochondrial gene regulation in healthy neurons and in AD, exposing putative new\nareas for therapeutic intervention.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nDementias lead to disability and dependency and are the leading cause of death among all diseases. While\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, genetically inherited dementias are epidemiologically\nrelevant and may provide insight into the pathogenic pathways and therapeutic targets for common dementias.\nHere, we focus on an autosomal recessive microgliopathy, known as Nasu-Hakola Disease (NHD), which is\ncaused by rare homozygous loss-of-function mutations in either TREM2 or TYROBP (encoding DAP12). In\ncontrast to AD, which manifests with aging, NHD progresses quickly, often resulting in death by the fifth decade.\nWe recently examined specimens of brain occipital cortical tissues from three rare DAP12-deficient patients with\nNHD by single nucleus RNA-seq. This analysis showed that lack of DAP12 is associated with a unique\ntranscriptome microglia profile indicative of enhanced RUNX1/2, STAT3 and TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways that\nmediate tissue repair functions. We postulate that DAP12 attenuates the RUNX, STAT3 and/or TGF\u03b2 pathways.\nIn the absence of DAP12 (or TREM2), unrestricted signaling of these pathways may cause maladaptive\nresponses of microglia to stimuli normally received from the brain microenvironment, leading to exaggerated\ntissue repair reactions, widespread tissue alterations, microvascular alterations, and neuronal loss. In this grant,\nwe aim to investigate whether the lack of DAP12 in microglia leads to heightened signaling of RUNX/STAT3 in\nvitro. Furthermore, we will explore whether excessive RUNX/STAT3 signaling in microglia, independent of\nDAP12 influence, disrupts the expression of genes responsible for microglial functions, including phagocytosis,\ncytokine production, and wound repair. Ultimately, we seek to understand how these mechanisms contribute to\nbrain pathology. In Aim 1, we will investigate the impact of DAP12 deficiency on the expression of RUNX1/2 in\nhuman iPSC-derived microglia (iMGL). Regardless of whether DAP12 directly regulates these factors, we will\nexplore the consequences of RUNX1/2 overexpression on transcriptome and functionality of iMGL. Additionally,\nwe will assess the repercussions of altered microglial expression of RUNX in vivo using a mouse model where\nRUNX2 is selectively induced in microglia. In Aim 2, we will focus on STAT3, which drives macrophage\nresponses to IL-6 family cytokines and IL-10. Our preliminary data show that NHD microglia exhibit a\ntranscriptional signature resembling that of IL-10\u2013STAT3-stimulated macrophages. We also found that DAP12-\ndeficient macrophages contain more phosphorylated and total STAT3 than do wild-type macrophages. We will\ninvestigate whether lack of DAP12 increases STAT3 activation in human iMGLs and delineate the molecular and\nfunctional changes induced by a gain-of-function mutant of STAT3 in human iMGLs. Furthermore, we will\nevaluate the impact of STAT3 gain-of-function on glial phenotype and brain pathology using in an vivo knock-in\nmouse model. Overall, this project will elucidate the role of RUNX1/2 and STAT3 in driving the expression of\ngenes which, if dysregulated, may alter microglial functions inducing brain pathology and dementia.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nThe objectives of this application are to characterize how age-related changes (1) in gene expression in niche\ncells and (2) in the niche microenvironment impact the process of spermatogenesis. It is known that decreased\nstem cell function with age is due at least in part to a decline in niche cell function and number. However, niche\ncell aging is poorly understood in most tissues. This proposal uses the adult Drosophila testis as a model for\nidentifying age-related intrinsic and extrinsic processes in niche cell function. The work will capitalize upon the\npowerful genetics available in flies, as well as the ability to unequivocally identify all cells in the testis. The fly\ntestis stem cell niche is formed by 12 quiescent niche cells (termed \u201chub\u201d cells), which supports germline stem\ncells and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs). The number of hub cells significantly declines during aging as they\nlose quiescence and transdifferentiate into fully-functional CySCs. The PI's published work shows that Activin\nsignaling controls hub cell quiescence (and hence hub cell number) during aging. In young testes, Activin are\ninhibited by the secreted antagonist Follistatin (Fs). In older testes, there are more Activin mRNAs and less Fs\nmRNAs, leading to an increase in free local Activin proteins, which trigger the Activin receptor on hub cells.\nAutonomous Activin signaling causes hub cells to exit quiescence and transdifferentiate into new CySCs,\nresulting in the age-related decline of hub cells. These results support the model that age-related changes in\nActivin-responsive genes induce the cell cycle in aged hub cells. State-of-the-art transcriptomic techniques will\nbe used in Aim 1 to identify genes differentially expressed in young and aged hub cells and genes whose\nexpression is dependent on Activin signaling. Validated genes will be used to test the model that the differentially-\nupregulated genes causes hub cell proliferation, hub-to-CySC conversion, and, ultimately, hub cell loss.\n Other published work from the PI's lab shows an age-dependent change in the niche microenvironment: an\nextracellular matrix (ECM) surrounds the niche in aged but not young testes. When this ECM is inhibited, there\nis a significant increase in the number of hub cells in aged testes. These results support the model that the ECM\nin aged testes binds Activin, increasing the chance of Activin binding to its receptor. However, there are no\nreagents to monitor Activin or Fs proteins or pathway activity in vivo in flies. To overcome this barrier, new tools\nto monitor Activin components and signaling in flies will be developed in Aim 2.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nAdult human cardiomyocytes have poor capacity for proliferation and functional recovery after heart attack, thus\nleading to the high morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, there is great need to under-\nstand the underlying mechanisms of adult cardiomyocyte turnover and maturation. While screening for modula-\ntors of TEAD1, a core component of the cardiac transcriptional network, my lab identified a novel factor\u2014\nC5ORF51/RIMOC1\u2014as a potential cardiomyogenic modulator. C5ORF51 (hereinafter referred to as C5x) is a\npreviously uncharacterized protein of nearly unknown function, which appears to play critical roles in the regula-\ntion of cardiomyocyte homeostasis and heart size. The overarching hypothesis is that C5x, as a novel TEAD1\ncofactor, regulates cardiomyogenesis by functioning as a modulator of core cardiac transcription factors. The\nrationale for the project is that both the ex vivo and in vivo C5x knockout models demonstrate significantly ac-\ncelerated cell cycle activity and cardiomyocyte endowment. Importantly, C5x-cardiomyocyte-knockout mice de-\nvelop massive cardiomegaly and premature mortality, demonstrating a critical role of C5x in maintaining normal\ncardiac function. RNA sequencing analysis suggests C5x as a gatekeeper for the fetal gene program. We pro-\npose two aims to address our hypothesis: [Aim 1] Determine the mechanisms by which C5x modulates tran-\nscription in cardiomyocytes. [Aim 2] Investigate the role of C5x in adult cardiomyocyte proliferation and matura-\ntion. Under the first aim, we will investigate the molecular interactive model between C5x and TEAD1. We will\nfurther determine the interacting partners of C5x in cardiomyocytes to understand its regulatory network. Under\nthe second aim, we will determine proliferation in the sub-aim 2A and function in sub-aim 2B. Specifically, we\nwill test whether C5x loss is sufficient to induce cell cycle reentry and fetal gene program reactivation in adult,\nwe will also test whether C5x loss is able to induce more cells to enter cell cycle in the cardiac injury models. We\nwill determine the necessity of C5x in cardiomyocyte maturation and function. The research proposed in this\napplication is innovative because this is the first study demonstrating the nonredundant role of C5x in vivo and\nin heart and illustrating a novel transcriptional modulator in cardiomyocytes. The proposed study is significant\nbecause it will uncover a novel regulatory mechanism leveraging cell cycling and maturation. Ultimately, this\nknowledge has the potential of offering new opportunities for the development of innovative treatment modality\nto induce cardiogenesis.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Recent technological advances that allowed for the mapping of selected RNA modifications on a transcript-wide\nscale have revealed a wide-spread distribution of N6-methyladenosine (m6A), pseudouridine (\u03a8), 5-\nmethylcytosine (m5C), ribose 2\u2019-O-methylation (Nm), and adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing on mRNA.\nThe m6A is the most abundant base modification in RNA (over 118,000 m6A peaks in human transcriptome),\nand controls a plethora of systems, including stem cell proliferation and differentiation, cellular heat shock\nresponses, spermatogonia differentiation, maternal-to-zygotic transition, X-chromosome inactivation, UV DNA\ndamage response, neurogenesis, and tumorigenesis. A variety of illnesses have been further linked with m6A\nmethylation disorder, including acute myeloid leukemia, gliomas, breast cancer, and lung cancer in humans.\nDespite widespread recognition of the important functions of RNA modifications, the availability of technologies\nthat can monitor and image site-specific RNA modifications are lacking. Novel tools for the site-specific\ndetection of RNA modifications in cells and other biological samples are urgently needed. The overall goal\nof this project is to develop novel, easy to use fluorescence-based methods and reagents for sequence\nspecific imaging of RNA modifications. The goal of Phase I was to establish the feasibility of novel m6A\nantibody-based imaging reagents. In Phase I, we have developed the first-in-class and the best-in-class\nhomogeneous antibody-based novel assays to determine the extent of site-specific m6A RNA modifications.\nFurthermore, we greatly exceeded the original goal of Phase I by developing an additional novel \u201cno antibody\u201d\nmethod which entirely avoids the use of m6A antibody, reducing reagent\u2019s complexity and cost. With these two\nnovel methods established in Phase I, we are ready to move into a Phase II project. Our aims include Aim 1.\nDevelop optimal protocols for staining fixed cells using the methods established in Phase I. Aim 2. Test methods\nto increase sensitivity of detection. Aim 3. Evaluate and compare the performance of all method variants using\ncell culture systems. Aim 4. Expand and validate the methods to measuring other RNA modifications such as A-\nto-I RNA editing and m5C. In addition, all the methods, reagents, and protocols developed and validated\ninternally by Mediomics will be sent to a leading laboratory in this field for third party validation to ensure that\nMediomics' newly developed assays work well in any laboratory that may have an interest in epitranscriptomics\nand the quantification of RNA modifications. Successfully validated assay kits will be ready for commercialization.\nThese novel methods could become the first standard approach for analyzing RNA modifications in any sample\nand will enable researchers to perform fluorescence-based imaging for RNA modifications in important biological\nsamples, including brain and cancer samples. It may further serve as an important diagnostic or prognostic\nclinical tool for detecting altered modification levels in the mRNA of tumors.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract\nIn development, the embryo generates many cell types with distinct gene expression programs, leading to\nheterogeneity across cells. In cancer, mutation generates heterogeneity, with a growing recognition that non-\ngenetic (epigenetic) mechanisms contribute to tumor heterogeneity and treatment failure. The ability to take the\nsame genetic template and form different cell states, exhibiting cell-to-cell variation in gene expression and\nbehavior, is fundamental to many cell systems across problems in human health including stem cells, cancer,\nand immune cell function. Yet, the mechanisms by which cell systems encode heterogeneity in gene expression\nare unclear. Pluripotent embryonic stem cells give rise to all the cells of the adult mammal, and primary\nembryonic stem cells are genetically stable in culture, making them an ideal system for studying the emergence\nof non-genetic heterogeneity in cell systems. Cell-to-cell variation in gene expression that arises in the absence\nof environmental signals has previously been termed `noise', or attributed to stochastic processes of gene\nexpression. However, gene expression heterogeneity is reproducible, suggesting regulation. The goal of this\nproposal is to identify regulatory mechanisms by which the genome encodes non-genetic heterogeneity in cell\nsystems. We will use embryonic stem cells as a model system for gene expression heterogeneity. First, we will\nidentify transcription factor pairs whose combined activity at enhancers leads to transcriptional heterogeneity of\nthe regulated gene. In order for heterogeneity to result in forming distinct states with the potential to prime stem\ncells into different lineages, heterogeneity must be heritable. Second, using a modified Luria-Delbruck fluctuation\nanalysis, we will identify memory loci capable of heritable transmission of non-genetic heterogeneity across cell\ngenerations. Motifs such as autoregulation, whereby a gene's product can regulate its own production, may\ncontribute to the formation of different cell states and therefore to heterogeneity across a cell population. Third,\nwe will manipulate a single factor within or outside of an autoregulatory loop to determine how it impacts\nheterogeneity. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage an assay we have developed which allows the\nidentification of actively transcribed regulatory regions and genes in small subsets of cells. Completion of these\ngoals will address longstanding questions about the origins of heterogeneity in cell systems and will advance a\nsystems level approach for understanding cell state. If successful, the proposal may unlock future studies\napplying similar approaches to identify non-genetic drivers of tumor heterogeneity and treatment failure.\nTherapeutic targeting of these mechanisms may unlock new treatment strategies for cancer.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT ABSTRACT\nNager syndrome (OMIM#154400) is a rare craniofacial and limb disorder characterized by midface retrusion,\nmicrognathia, absent thumbs, and radial hypoplasia. This disorder results from mutations in the SF3B4\n(splicing factor 3b, subunit 4) gene, which encodes SAP49, a protein that is a component of the spliceosome.\nThe spliceosome is a complex of RNA and proteins that function together to remove introns and join exons\nfrom transcribed pre-mRNA. While the spliceosome is present and functions in all cells of the body, many\nspliceosomopathies \u2013 including Nager syndrome \u2013 are often cell/tissue-specific in their pathology. In Nager\nsyndrome patients it is the neural crest (NC)-derived craniofacial skeletal structures that are affected. The\nmechanisms underlying Nager syndrome pathology, as well as its tissue-specificity, are poorly understood.\nInterestingly, other craniofacial spliceosomopathies, such as craniofacial microsomia (SF3B2), mandibulofacial\ndysostosis Guion-Almeida type (EFTUD2), Burn-McKeown syndrome (TXNL4A), and Verheij syndrome\n(PUF60) share similar clinical features with Nager syndrome, however it is unclear if they are caused by the\nsame underlying mechanisms. In this application, I will combine use of a Xenopus tropicalis sf3b4 mutant line\nand Nager syndrome patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to tease apart the mechanisms\nunderlying Nager syndrome. This combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches will provide novel insights into\nthe mechanisms driving craniofacial defects in the context of Nager syndrome, which can then be translated to\nother craniofacial spliceosomopathies to determine if they share a common root cause. The proposed\nexperiments will test the hypothesis that SF3B4 has NC-specific targets and/or binding partners, and upon\nmutation these interactions are disrupted or lost, leading to abnormal NC development and subsequent Nager\nsyndrome-associated craniofacial defects. I have crafted three specific aims to test this possibility. Specific Aim\n1: Using preliminary data from RNA-seq analyses performed on a Xenopus tropicalis sf3b4 mutant line, I\npropose to identify the biological pathways disrupted in Nager syndrome by testing candidate genes via gain-\nand loss-of-function experiments in Xenopus tropicalis. Specific Aim 2: In collaboration with the Columbia Stem\nCell Core, I propose to generate and characterize a Nager syndrome patient-derived iPSC line, and use this\nline to characterize NC in the context of Nager syndrome. Specific Aim 3: In the R00 phase of the application, I\nplan to use the knowledge and experience from modeling Nager syndrome and develop in vivo and in vitro\nmodels of other craniofacial spliceosomopathies in order to determine their root cause. Altogether these\nstudies will provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying Nager syndrome craniofacial defects, which\ncan be used to inform work on other craniofacial spliceosomopathies, establishing a unique view on\nunderstanding craniofacial development and disorders.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Developing programmable RNA writing tools with the novel RNA-guided RNA-targeting CRISPR effector Cas7-11",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary: While gene editing technologies have revolutionized the ability to programmably edit DNA\nwith high efficiency in diverse tissues, there remain several challenges with DNA editing, including permanent\noff-targets, concern for permanent correction of certain diseases, and some diseases being better targeted by\nother modalities than gene editing. For example, treatment of triplet repeat disorders with gene editing remains\ndifficult, due to the difficulty of targeting repeat regions in the genome and the need to make large and precise\ndeletions, without causing off-target genome rearrangements and other undesired effects on the genome. RNA\nmodifications, however, may offer a better approach with notable features: 1) temporal and reversible\nmodification of genetic diseases, 2) minimal off-targets which are reversible and less harmful, and 3) more\nversatile editing beyond genome editing. For example, with triplet repeat disorders, an RNA writing strategy\ncould allow for collapse of the repeats to the exact desired number, an approach that would be more\nsuccessful than gene editing or RNA knockdown strategies that have failed. To accomplish RNA writing, which\ninvolves all possible base edits (transitions and transversions), small or large insertions, and small or large\nreplacements (e.g. exon swapping), some approaches have been developed, such as trans-splicing, but with\nlimited success. Trans-splicing relies on the recruitment of an RNA template to a pre-mRNA without any active\ntargeting domains and involves competition with the cis target. As a result, programmable trans-splicing has\nhad low efficiency. We hypothesized that combining trans-splicing with programmable RNA guided CRISPR\nsystems could help boost the efficiency of the trans-splicing mechanism, enabling any potential type of RNA\nedit, insertion, deletion, or replacement to be incorporated into endogenous transcripts. While we and others\nhave characterized novel programmable RNA targeting CRISPR systems, such as Cas13, and developed tools\nfrom these systems, use of these tools have been limited in cellular systems due to a non-promiscuous\ncleavage activity known as collateral activity. While Cas13 has been shown to have specific RNA cleavage\nactivity in some cell types, other cell types have had significant collateral cleavage of cellular RNAs, leading to\ntoxicity in cell models. The proposed work will address these needs by combining biochemical characterization,\nstructural characterization, and enzyme engineering to develop new RNA targeting CRISPR nucleases\nwithout collateral activity, such as the novel CRISPR-Cas7-11 enzyme, for specific RNA writing tools in\nconjunction with trans-splicing to enable any possible RNA edit. Beyond optimizing the RNA writing technology\nvia trans-splicing optimization using RNA and protein engineering, we will showcase RNA writing\u2019s therapeutic\npotential by correcting triplet repeat disorders in iPSC-derived human neurons. The developed technologies in\nthis proposal will accelerate the pace of biomedical research and enable treatment of many genetic disorders,\nmany of which are not treatable with gene editing, bringing more therapies to patients.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of death among the elderly community in the United States.\nThe socio-economic burden of the disease is steeply escalating as the number of AD patients is projected to nearly\ntriple to 14 million by 2060. Memory loss is a core clinical phenotype results from irreversible damage of\nneuronal circuits in the brain. Although advances in science have made remarkable strides in understanding the\ndisease, the currently approved drugs focus primarily on alleviating symptoms, not stalling disease progression.\nNeuroinflammation due to the aggregation and inappropriate clearance of fibril amyloid-beta (fA\u03b2) by glial cells\nis a hallmark of AD. Glial cells including microglia and astrocytes communicate through signaling pathways\nand an ensemble of receptors including scavenger receptors (SRs). In AD, the recognition of fA\u03b2 by SRs triggers\nglial activation, attenuates glial clearance of fA\u03b2 and exacerbates neuroinflammation.\nOur labs have advanced a library of synthetic amphiphilic macromolecule (AMs)-based nanoparticles (NPs) that\ncan be targeted to ensemble SR receptors. Our preliminary data show that SR-specific AM-NPs counteract the\nfA\u03b2-mediated inflammatory microglial activation. In line with this, the internalization of fA\u03b2 through SRs is\nblocked by AM-NPs in microglia. Furthermore, AM-NPs arrest the in vitro formation of fA\u03b2 from monomers.\nInterestingly, our AM-NPs stimulate fA\u03b2 lysosomal clearance in microglial. Finally, our AM-NPs prevent the\nneurotoxic effect of fA\u03b2-induced microglial inflammatory cytokines.\nGiven these findings, we hypothesize that the utilization of SR-selective NPs is a neuroprotective multimodal\napproach to interrupt fA\u03b2-SRs complex formation and arrest inflammatory cascade of glial communication. This\nhypothesis will be addressed in the following specific aims: (1) to elucidate the role of SR-targeted NPs in the\namelioration of fA\u03b2-mediated pathological glial communications; and (2) to evaluate the longer-term\nneuroprotective effects of SR-specific AM-NPs within an AD pathological model based on 3D multicellular\nhuman organoid cultures.\nIn summary, this exploratory study seeks to develop an innovative nanotechnology to abrogate the\nneuroinflammatory crosstalk that exacerbates AD progression using state-of-the-art technologies of\nnanoparticles, stem cells, and brain-like mimetic human organoids.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Indoles from commensal microbiota promote mobility during aging",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract: Aging is associated with loss of mobility and infirmity, which accounts for 23% of the total global burden of\ndisease in people aged 60 years and older and will only increase over the next 20 years. Frailty is associated with dysbiosis\n23, 41-43, but it is unclear what microbiota products contribute to health or frailty. We identified indole and its derivatives as\nmolecules secreted by benevolent commensal bacteria that act across diverse phyla (C. elegans, Drosophila and mice) to\naugment healthspan and allow animals to live better for longer1. Indoles derived from commensal bacteria act via the Aryl\nhydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) to promote healthy intestinal homeostasis20, augment intestinal barrier integrity and limit\nsystemic inflammation1, 20, 23, as well as promote DNA repair and genome integrity in stem cells and germ cells22.\nPreliminary and published data1 also suggest that as animals age, indoles limit the loss of muscle proteins concomitant\nwith loss of mobility. Citing our work as the starting point1, a recent metabolomic study was initiated using samples from\nthe Arivale and Osteoporotic Fractures in Men [MrOS] cohorts and found that loss of indole producing bacteria and\nreduced plasma indole levels correlated with decreased mobility in aged humans44, 45. We hypothesize that indoles act via\nAhr to (i) promote stability of muscle proteins essential for the contractile apparatus by promoting chaperone-mediated\nrefolding of damaged proteins, and by regulating proteasome activity to promote loss of irreparable proteins and limit\naggregation of damaged proteins. We have identified other indole-regulated process in muscle that may act in\nconjunction with proteostatic mechanisms to promote mobility in the aged. These include regulation of genes associated\nwith mitochondrial respiratory function and efficiency, which fuels muscle activity but declines with age46, 47. Together, we\nhypothesize that these mechanisms maintain muscle mass and function and thereby promote mobility in the aged. Aim 1\nwill determine the mechanism by which indole limits age-dependent loss of existing assembled myofibrils via upregulating\nthe levels of the myosin chaperone UNC-45 and additional chaperones and proteasome components. Aim 2 will develop\naddress whether indole affects additional cellular pathways by using genetic approaches to identify which indole-\nregulated genes are critical for maintaining mobility during aging. Gene ontogeny (GO) analysis to date has shown that\nindole upregulates genes essential for mitochondrial function in aging animals. Thus, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that\nindole maintains or improves mitochondrial function in aged animals so as to fuel muscle activity and/or limit production\nof factors that disrupt proteostasis (e.g. ROS). We use genetic and biochemical analysis in the nematode Caenorhabditis\nelegans, whose striated muscles exhibit significant structural conservation with mammals. Importantly, as C. elegans age,\nthey exhibit loss of mobility and changes in proteostasis, including loss of the contractile apparatus and mitochondrial\nfunction, characteristic features of sarcopenia in mammals. Here, we also propose to corroborate our worm results in\naged mice. Together, these studies will provide mechanistic information on how indoles derived from commensal bacteria\ncounteract sarcopenia during aging. These mechanistic studies are essential to developing indoles as biomarkers for frailty\nand health, and as possible therapeutics to treat muscle wasting, including sarcopenia in elderly people.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), the most common cause of progressive dementia in adults over the age of 65, is a\ndevastating disorder without effective treatment options. Available drugs treat late-stage symptoms rather than\naddressing disease-causing pathways. There is an urgent need for new protein targets that potentially act via\npreviously unexplored mechanisms to halt AD progression. Human protein kinases represent a highly tractable\nclass of targets that have largely been examined with respect to oncology, but which hold great promise in areas\nsuch as neurodegeneration. Protein kinase casein kinase 2 (CK2) is highly expressed in the mammalian brain\nand has many validated substrates that are critical in neural cell homeostasis and signaling processes across\nsynapses. These roles have indicated that CK2 is a key regulator of neuronal function and that it may represent\na novel target to treat neurodegenerative diseases like AD. Through extensive evaluation of our first library of\npyrazolopyrimidines, we identified SGC-CK2-1 as a potent, selective, and cell-active CK2 chemical probe.\nRemarkably, despite years of research pointing to CK2 as a key driver in cancer, SGC-CK2-1 did not elicit a\nsignificant antiproliferative phenotype when tested in nearly 180 cancer cell lines. SGC-CK2-1 also does not\ndemonstrate toxicity in human stem cell-derived neurons/microglia at doses required for CK2 inhibition. Guided\nby crystal structures and published data, we have developed a medicinal chemistry plan to address the metabolic\nliabilities of SGC-CK2-1 and develop it into a probe that is suitable for in vivo use. Part of this strategy involves\nalso adding functionalities into our CK2 inhibitors that improve their blood\u2013brain penetrance. Calculations and\npredictive software models will aid medicinal chemistry efforts and help prioritize compounds to be made. Many\nof these simulations will be corroborated with experimental data, including kinetic solubility, lipophilicity,\nmicrosomal stability, and CNS pharmacokinetic data, which will increase our confidence in their utility. Optimized\nCK2 inhibitors will be profiled in stem cell-based assays that model key pathogenic signaling pathways in AD\nrelated to neuroinflammation, a process we have shown to be at least partially regulated by CK2. Our lead CK2\nchemical probe candidates will be dosed in a 3xTg mouse model of AD to validate CK2 target engagement in\nvivo. All publications that have attempted to characterize CK2 function using a CK2 inhibitor have used a sub-\noptimal compound, most often CX-4945 or TBB, that suffers from potent inhibition of off-target kinases and other\nliabilities, including broad antiproliferative activity, that preclude its use in AD. Despite these issues, CX-4945\nhas been dosed systemically in humans for oncology indications, which confirms that clinical inhibition of CK2 is\ntolerated. Development of a potent and selective in vivo probe targeting CK2 that lacks broad antiproliferative\nactivity will enable confirmation of its putative role in AD for the first time.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nThe placenta performs important functions to ensure proper development of the fetus, including oxygen and\nnutrients exchange, waste product removal and hormone secretion. It also acts as a barrier to protect the fetus\nfrom harmful substances and pathogens that might be present in the maternal circulation. Despite its short\nlifespan, the placenta plays a critical role in the survival and growth of the fetus. Implantation failure and\ninadequate placental development can lead to pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia, miscarriage,\nand fetal growth restriction. However, our understanding of human placenta development is quite limited due to\nscarcity of fetal tissues, ethical restrictions and lack of practical experimental tools.\n Our preliminary studies show that human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) possess an intrinsic self-\norganization property. When a colony of hTSCs starts to cluster, they spontaneously form an organoid with\ncavities resembling trophoblastic lacunae, and can continuously develop into a multicellular tissue resembling\nfirst-trimester placental villi under a neuregulin 1 (NRG1) stimulation. In this proposed research, we will\nundertake an exploratory, high-risk but high-reward study to generate a microfluidic human placenta model.\nSpecifically, we will derive hTSCs from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) through a na\u00efve\npluripotency stage. We will then use these hTSCs to generate microfluidic placenta organoids. The role of YAP\nsignaling in regulating spontaneous syncytiotrophoblast (STB) differentiation will be examined. We will further\ninduce the development of placental villus-like tissue by modulating timing and concentration of NRG1, and\nexamine morphologies and cell composition of the resultant placenta organoids. Important, we will conduct\nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on the resultant placental villus-like tissue at different times\nand perform transcriptome-wide comparisons with published in vivo human placenta scRNA-seq datasets.\n This hTSC- derived human placenta organoid system will offer the first-of-its-kind experimental platform\nfor studying previously elusive stages of human placental development.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n The promise of human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hSC-CMs) opens doors towards the feasibility\nof personalized medicine against cardiac diseases and for performing more accurate drug discovery studies.\nMoreover, hSC-CMs overcome the issue of species differences when using animal models for high throughput\nscreening studies. However, one of the bottlenecks for scaling up the use of hSC-CMs is their ability to accurately\nreflect the native structure and function of adult human cardiomyocytes. Current efforts to address this critical\nchallenge involve maturation protocols that use biophysical cues such as electrical stimulation or substrate-\ninduced tissue alignment. Methods for electrical stimulation often utilize electrode contacts for field stimulation,\nbulky instrumentation for combining electrical stimuli delivery with mechanical or sustained chemical stimulation,\nor genetically modifying cells to be light-responsive. Although we have seen successes through these induction\nand stimulation approaches, the field would benefit from a stimulation approach with minimal culture contact to\nreduce risk of infection during long-term cultures, as well as a light-based approach with higher spatiotemporal\nresolution than electrode-based stimulation. Here, we propose a new paradigm for stimulating hSC-CMs towards\nmaturation by interfacing these cells with peptide-based substrates that can induce tissue anisotropy and\nare engineered to convert light to stimulatory cues. Our team will develop peptides functionalized with\nchromophore units and cell-binding epitopes as materials that can be used for light-based stimulation of hSC-\nCMs, in combination with induction of tissue alignment, towards maturation. The long-term goal of this project is\nto establish light stimulation via engineered peptides as a viable method to stimulate cardiomyocytes and\npromote hSC-CM maturation in an electrodeless and non-genetic manner. We hypothesize that transient\ncharging and other associated light-induced processes at the cardiomyocyte-biomaterial interface can influence\nextracellular potential, resulting in the photostimulation of hSC-CMs towards maturation. Our rationale for\nproposing a materials-based approach for stimulating hSC-CMs stems from previous reports of conjugated\npolymers being used as a photoactive substrate for triggering action potentials of other excitable cells. To test\nour hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: (1) establishing design parameters for engineered\npeptide substrates with optimal photostimulation efficiency; (2) test the cellular- and tissue-level impact of\npeptide-mediated photostimulation in combination with anisotropic cues; and (3) elucidate the effect of the\nproposed photostimulation method, along with anisotropy cues, on hSC-CM maturation. By establishing the\ndesign rules for the proposed photoexcitable peptides for eliciting combinatorial cues to stimulate hSC-CMs and\nensure their capability to excite cardiac cells, this innovative approach offers a new strategy for a \u201cwireless\u201d\nstimulation of cardiac tissues towards maturation, and can therefore significantly contribute towards addressing\nthe grand challenge of immaturity of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAlcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), caused by excessive alcohol consumption, is a growing public health\nproblem with a significant impact on the global population. In the United States, ALD is now a cause of rising\nliver-related mortality, especially among younger patients.\n Despite this severity, there are currently no FDA-approved therapies. The absence of consensus on\noptimal drug targets or strategies underscores gaps in our mechanistic understanding of disease drivers.\nWhile animal models have greatly contributed to our understanding of ALD pathogenesis, their utility and\nclinical relevance remain a subject of debate. To enhance diagnostic capabilities and advance effective\ntherapeutics, it is imperative to establish reliable human-relevant models that mimic the liver's response to\ndisease-specific challenges. The increasing number of genetic variants associated with ALD susceptibility\nfurther underscores the necessity for human-relevant systems.\n To address these limitations, we devised a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived model\nfor ALD research, capitalizing on a multicellular in vitro liver culture system recently pioneered in our lab.\nWithin this multicellular setup, we co-cultivated hiPSC-derived hepatocytes, macrophages, and hepatic\nstellate cells (HSCs), mirroring the intricate dynamics of liver physiology in both health and disease. Our\ninvestigations unveiled that subjecting the liver culture to clinically relevant blood-alcohol concentrations\nsuccessfully replicated many pivotal alcohol (EtOH)-induced and endotoxin (i.e., LPS)-mediated ALD features.\nDeeper scrutiny of hepatocytes over time revealed a macrophage-mediated upregulation of hepatic progenitor\nmarkers, a dedifferentiation phenotype frequently observed in ALD patients. Furthermore, the liver cultures\nexhibited a heightened reaction to EtOH/LPS than EtOH or LPS alone, especially in terms of HSC activation.\nSubsequent investigation unveiled that EtOH exposure sensitized HSCs to LPS stimulation and TGF\u03b2-\ninduced activation, revealing a previously unexplored mechanism underlying ALD pathogenesis.\n Across three aims, employing cell and molecular approaches, we capitalize on the unique features of\nthis platform to address questions that cannot be sufficiently explored through existing ex vivo human-relevant\nsystems. We focus on our working hypothesis, postulating that activated macrophages induce hepatocyte\ndedifferentiation through the secretion of soluble factors (Aim 1), and that EtOH exposure elicits changes in\nspecific genes and pathways, contributing to the heightened sensitivity of HSCs to LPS and TGF\u03b2 (Aim 2).\nAim 3 seeks to unravel the roles of a genetic risk factor (i.e., rs738409 C>G variant in PNPLA3), in ALD\ndevelopment. These efforts will pave the way for more precise therapeutic interventions and targeted\ntreatments. A better comprehension of the genetic influencers of ALD risk has the potential to enhance the\nidentification of at-risk populations and fortify disease prevention strategies.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Advances in next-generation sequencing are enhancing the routine detection of human genetic variants,\nparticularly in clinical settings. Yet, the ability to interpret the functional consequences of these variants has\nlagged far behind. While the identification of clinically actionable and pathogenic mutations has revolutionized\nthe field of precision medicine, these unfortunately represent a small minority of reported human genetic variants.\nA large fraction of patients (~30-70%) who undergo diagnostic genome sequencing are found to have variants\nof unknown significance (VUS), for which a clinical impact cannot be assigned. Multiple computational methods\nhave been designed to score the severity of a particular protein-coding mutation. While informative, predictions\nfrom these methods are imperfect and do not give mechanistic insights into a variant\u2019s impact. On the other\nhand, laboratory-based functional genomics approaches have been used to characterize individual pathogenic\nvariants in human cell lines or model organisms, but these methods are low-throughput and can only focus on a\nhandful of mutations. Given the sheer volume of identified (and as-yet undiscovered) genetic variants in need of\nclinical interpretation, there is a pressing need for high-throughput technologies to address this challenge. Here,\nwe describe complementary experimental and computational strategies for high-throughput\ncharacterization of the impact of genetic variants in key regulatory and DNA repair genes. We focus on\nmutations in \"trans-acting factors\u201d such as chromatin regulators, transcription factors and DNA repair genes,\nwhich are widely implicated in human disease. Mutations in these genes have the potential to induce widespread\ntranscriptomic, chromatin or genomic changes, and thus are most amenable to the strategies described in our\nproposal. Notably, while these categories represent only a subset of clinically actionable genes, they nonetheless\nencompass thousands of potential gene targets. We interrogate two classes of phenotypes: global\ntranscriptomic/chromatin changes induced by mutations to key transcription factors or other regulatory proteins,\nand mutator phenotypes induced by disrupting proteins involved in DNA repair processes. We first develop\nscBE-seq (single cell base editor sequencing), which combines pooled, high-precision genome editing with\nsingle-cell sequencing assays to interrogate effects of hundreds of variants simultaneously. scBE-seq leverages\nchemical base editing (BE) to introduce specific single nucleotide variants (SNVs). In parallel, we develop\ncomputational approaches leveraging genomics datasets from large biobanks to identify genes harboring high-\nimpact variants which can be followed up using scBE-seq. Overall, our proposal brings together complementary\nexpertise spanning computational human genomics, molecular biology, genome editing and\ndevelopment/implementation of genomic technologies. We envision the proposed experimental and\ncomputational strategies will make important advances in the ability to interpret the impact of individual variants\nin a variety of contexts and provide insights for predicting the effects of previously unobserved genetic variants.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nAdvances in sequencing technologies provide new opportunities to interrogate biological systems from multiple\nperspectives. However, the introduction of new technologies highlights a problem many researchers face:\nmissing data. Missing observations across technologies and biological states is a frequently observed problem\nin the field of computational biology. This missingness can be a result of limitations in the technology, the rarity\nof a biological state, or because the technology has not been widely adopted. While one technology may have\nhigh sparsity in biological observations, there is an opportunity to leverage existing, complementary data from\nan established technology to impute the missing biological observations.\nWe address these issues by utilizing new methodological advances in machine learning, primarily focusing on\ndomain adaptation techniques. These techniques learn patterns in one dataset that can be adapted to another\ndataset, enabling cross-technology information sharing. Our proposal introduces a general framework in which\ndomain adaptation techniques can be used to unite an emerging technology with a different, but technology. To\nhighlight the broad utility of this approach, we apply this model to three biomedical applications: 1) Predict\ncell-type-specific perturbation response in rheumatoid arthritis; 2) Predict tissue-of-origin from cell-free DNA\n(cfDNA); 3) Predict progenitor-specific gene signatures from cell-free DNA in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\nThe proposed aims not only unite existing and emerging sequencing technologies, but enable the discovery of\nnew biology that is difficult or infeasible to directly observe.\nThe research proposed builds on my experience in using statistical approaches for transcriptomic data. During\nthe K99 phase I will require further training from my mentoring team in deep generative modeling (Dr. Casey\nGreene), modeling of single-cell data (Dr. Fan Zhang), and modeling of cfDNA and chromatin accessibility (Dr.\nSrinivas Ramachandran). The research will be conducted at the University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical\nCampus, in the Center for Health AI.

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Systematic characterization of tandem repeat variants contributing to complex traits",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic loci linked to complex\ntraits, but determining the causal variants, target genes, and biological mechanisms responsible for each signal\nremains challenging. While traditionally GWAS has focused on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the\nadvent of biobank-scale next-generation sequencing datasets as well as advanced functional genomics\ntechniques now enable systematic interrogation of the role of more complex variants in polygenic traits.\n We focus on the role of genetic variation at repetitive regions of the genome. Specifically, we consider\ntwo repeat types: short tandem repeats (STRs), consisting of repeated motifs of 1-6bp, and variable number\ntandem repeats (VNTRs), with motifs of 7+bp, which we collectively refer to as tandem repeats (TRs). TRs exhibit\nrapid mutation rates that render them one of the largest sources of genetic variation in humans. Increasing\nevidence suggests that TRs act as an important source of causal variants for complex traits and may drive some\nof the strongest GWAS signals identified to date. Yet, due to bioinformatic and experimental challenges in\nstudying repeats, the genome-wide role of TRs on complex human traits is only beginning to be uncovered.\n We hypothesize that TR variants are key drivers of complex traits. We recently published the first\ngenome-wide integration of TRs into the GWAS framework. This identified 93 STRs predicted to causally impact\nblood and serum biomarker traits and estimated STRs explain 5-10% of GWAS signals for these traits. We have\nexperimentally interrogated the effects of thousands of promoter TRs by optimizing a massively parallel reporter\nassays (MPRA) to enable studying low-complexity sequences. Using our MPRA we were able to show\nwidespread and cell-type specific TR effects on expression.\n While these findings offer intriguing evidence that thousands of TRs contribute to human phenotypes,\nthey have been limited by the range of TRs that could be accurately imputed into available GWAS datasets and\nthe biological mechanisms by which TRs affect complex traits remains unknown in most cases. Here, we\nleverage (i) newly available whole genome sequencing (WGS) for hundreds of thousands of individuals from UK\nBiobank (UKB) and All of Us (AoU) which will enable direct TR genotyping rather than imputation, (ii) a suite of\ncomputational tools we have developed for population-scale TR analysis and association testing, and (iii) our\nrecently developed MPRA and genome editing frameworks for experimental interrogation of TR effects to\nsystematically evaluate the contribution of TRs to complex traits in humans. Using these, we will develop scalable\nmethods to perform TR-based GWAS in large biobanks to generate a comprehensive catalog of TRs associated\nwith complex traits (Aim 1), use MPRA to investigate the effects of tens of thousands of TRs on gene regulation\n(Aim 2) and perform deep characterization of candidate medically relevant TRs in induced pluripotent stem cells\nand their differentiated derivatives in cell lines originating from ancestrally diverse donors (Aim 3).",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nPulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are sensory epithelial cells that signal to the brain\nthrough sensory neurons and locally through neuropeptides and neurotransmitters. We used\nscRNA-seq to comprehensively profile and analyze mouse and human PNECs, which revealed\nover 40 PNEC neuropeptides and hormones in diverse combinations. Here, we propose to map\nthe innervation and molecular subtypes of human pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and identify\nthe functional subsets in human lung, beginning with an investigation of functionally distinct\nneuroendocrine stem cells. Using precision cut lung slice cultures to establish an injury model\ninducing proliferation, we will identify the location of proliferative PNECs and measure their\ncomplete transcriptomic profiles by scRNA-seq. In parallel, we will use multiplex single molecule\nin situ hybridization methods to localize the human PNEC neuropeptides, identify their\ncombinations in situ, and their cognate receptors in human lung. Collectively, these studies will\ncomprehensively characterize the cellular and molecular features of human PNECs, their stem\ncells and niches. PNEC expansions and ectopic pulmonary neuroendocrine cells are the\ndistinguishing pathologic features underlying a common form of pediatric diffuse lung disease,\nneuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI), which is characterized by diffuse obstructive\nventilatory defect. In adults, a pre-neoplastic condition called diffuse idiopathic pulmonary\nneuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) is also associated with airway obstruction and\nprominent respiratory symptoms thought to be due to bioactive peptides from neuroendocrine\ncells. We will identify the neuropeptide and receptor expression in pathological cell niches\nduring NE stem cell transformation in DIPNECH. This work establishes a molecular foundation\nfor the diverse clinical presentations associated with pulmonary neuroendocrine lesions and\nidentifies panels of neuropeptides and hormones localized to precise anatomic locations that will\nprovide the basis for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Elucidating the Role of TGF-Beta Signaling in Craniofacial Fibrous Dysplasia of the Bone",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY:\nCraniofacial fibrous dysplasia (CFD) is a disabling skeletal disease with no curative medical therapies. It is\ncharacterized by fibrotic, expansile bone lesions that compress surrounding craniofacial structures and cause\nsignificant morbidity, including vision loss, hearing impairment, dysmorphic facies, fractures, pain, and dental\nand jaw abnormalities. Fibrous dysplasia (FD) can affect one or more bones throughout the skeleton, but the\nfemur, ribs and craniofacial skeleton are the most commonly affected sites. FD is caused by a somatic, mosaic\nactivating mutation in GNAS, the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding\nprotein, Gsa, leading to constitutive activation of Gsa and elevated intracellular cAMP levels in affected tissues.\nCFD can occur in isolation or in association with McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS), which is characterized by\npolyostotic FD (FD affecting more than one bone), caf\u00e9-au-lait-skin hyperpigmentation and precocious puberty.\nThere are no approved medical treatment options for FD, and there is a critical need to understand the\npathways that are activated downstream of Gsa to identify potential therapeutic targets for this disabling\ndisease. Our single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data on cells collected from human craniofacial and non-\ncraniofacial FD bone lesions has identified critical signaling pathways that are up-regulated in FD, including\nTGF\u03b2 signaling. TGFb signaling is critical for healthy skeletal development and repair, but when inappropriately\nactivated, it is a significant driver of tissue fibrosis, including pulmonary, renal and systemic fibrosis. Despite its\nestablished role in driving fibrosis of non-skeletal tissues, the contributory role of TGFb signaling in FD bone\nlesions remains unknown. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the role of TGF\u03b2 signaling in driving\nthe fibrotic bone phenotype seen in FD/MAS. Our central hypothesis is that TGF\u03b2 signaling is activated in\nresponse to Gs-GPCR signaling and contributes to the fibrosis and aberrant osteogenesis seen in FD lesions.\nTo test our hypothesis, we will pursue 2 aims. The first aim will elucidate the mechanisms driving TGF\u03b2 signaling\nin response to Gs-GPCR overactivation at a cellular level. We will use our iPSC model of FD/MAS to generate\nneural crest-derived mesenchymal osteogenic lineage cells and test the effect of TGFb stimulation and inhibition\non the fibrotic profile of these cells at different developmental stages. The second aim will use an in vivo murine\nmodel of FD in which GNASR201H is expressed in early osteoblastic lineages to test the effect of TGF\u03b2 signaling\ninhibition on the development of fibrosis and impaired osteogenesis using a pan-TGF\u03b2 antibody. Upon\nsuccessful completion of this project, we aim to shed light on the interplay between Gs-GPCR and TGF\u03b2 signaling\nin the skeleton and apply this knowledge to the treatment of CFD as well as more common diseases of impaired\nosteogenesis such as osteoporosis, heterotopic ossification, and fracture repair. The data generated in this\nproposal will be used in future grant applications to explore the role of metabolic and growth factor signaling\npathways that are dysregulated in response to constitutive Gs-signaling.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Manganese exposure  and genetic diversity in risk mechanisms for neurodevelopmental disorders",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nThe broad, long-term objectives of the grant are to increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying\nthe gene x environment interactions that link developmental manganese (Mn) exposure, dopamine (DA)\ndysregulation and increased frequency of ADHD diagnoses. Through the use of both sexes and varied genetic\nbackgrounds in our testing models (mice and human iPSC lines) we use a rigorous approach to deepen our\nunderstanding of the role of genetics on the strength of the mechanisms under investigation. Strong\nepidemiological and correlation evidence points to a relationship between overexposure to metals, including\nMn, and development of childhood and adolescent neuropsychological disorders. We will use oral exposures\nto mimic exposure to Mn through poorly filtered water such as that obtained from wells, at levels relevant to\nknown human exposures in N. America. We will support our behavioral studies with comprehensive analyses\nof dopaminergic (DAergic) function including post-mortem analyses of brain tissues, electrophysiology\napproaches in live brain slices and in vitro study of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived DA\nneurons. Our first Specific Aim is to Determine the role of sex and genetic background on Mn exposure-\ninduced behavioral change and DAergic transport deficits. Three background strains have been selected for\ntheir baseline differences in DAergic function, Mn metabolism and locomotor activity. Mice will be exposed to\ncontrol, moderate or high Mn through water from weaning to assess the impact of sub-toxic (i.e. no expected\ncell death) Mn levels in brain during development. We will use a range of behavioral outcomes that are\nrepresentative of changes observed in ADHD as well as variation observed in the general public. We will study\nDA metabolism and release/reuptake kinetics through neurochemistry, post translational protein modifications,\nRNA and electrophysiology approaches. In Specific Aim 2 we will Test whether Mn modifies pharmacological\nmodulation of DA transport in vivo. We will use genetic approaches to generate mild disturbances in the\nDAergic system from birth that cause only modestly altered phenotypes (behavioral and cellular). We will then\ntest whether Mn exposure is sufficient to drive these mild presentations towards full expression of abnormal\nphenotypes mimicking a classic gene x environmental exposure model of development of Intellectual and\nDevelopmental Disabilities. We will further test the potential for Mn to impact efficacy of common treatments for\nADHD. Finally, in Specific Aim 3 we will determine whether Mn has an ADHD-related differential impact on DA\nfunctional characteristics of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived DAergic neurons. We will use\ncell lines derived from males and females under baseline conditions, and following genetic mutation of the DA\ntransporter, or exposure to chemical ADHD risk factors. We will assess changes in neurochemistry and post-\ntranslational modifications to test the potential translational relevance of Aims 1 and 2. We will use single-cell\ngenetic pathway analysis to test hypotheses about which pathways are disrupted by Mn.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nElucidating the genetic and environmental drivers of disease is critical to precision medicine. Advancements\nin in vitro human stem cell culture are accelerating disease and therapeutic research across individuals of di-\nverse genetic backgrounds. Cell villages are an e!cient platform, that pools populations of 10-100 genetically\ndistinct, human stem cell lines, to study how genetic variation and environment in\ufb02uence a spectrum of molec-\nular phenotypes. This experimental design allows researchers to apply selection and perturbation treatments to\nlarge, ancestrally diverse cell populations, while simultaneously measuring phenotype di\u21b5erences between donors\nthrough molecular and omics assays. While villages show a lot of promise for uncovering Gene x Environment\n(GxE) interactions and the end e\u21b5ect on disease, two main limitations need to be addressed: (i) experimental\nmethods need to be re\ufb01ned to ensure reproducibility and adequate statistical power and (ii) statistical analysis\ntools need to be built to incorporate the full structure of these data. We aim to address these limitations by \ufb01rst\ndeveloping standards for cell village experimental design through statistical modeling and simulation of village\ndonor growth. Speci\ufb01cally, we will test how di\u21b5erent experimental parameters a\u21b5ect the amount of variation in\ndonor growth rate estimates, the consistency of these predictions and whether experiments can maintain donor\nrepresentation over the desired time frames. These factors will be important as we want to help researchers design\nexperiments that minimize the variance in the growth rate estimates, while maintaining high genetic diversity\nthroughout the entire experiment. Using this experimentally validated simulation framework, we will build a user-\nfriendly tool that enables researchers to input their own preliminary data to project how di\u21b5erent experimental\ndesign choices might impact the signals they are able to detect in the data and if donors might drop out or take\nover the population. In the second aim, we will build a hierarchical model of single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)\ntime series count data. The scRNA-seq pipeline will focus on two main applications: (i) a statistical tool that\naddresses the sparsity in single cell time series count data while accounting for natural variation in villages, and\n(ii) a tool that estimates the sequencing depth and village design needed to optimize statistical power. This\nwork will help researchers conduct reproducible, high powered cell village experiments while fully leveraging the\nstructure of the data. Improving cell village experimental and statistical methods will give researchers a powerful\nplatform for investigating individual disease risk and potential for speci\ufb01c therapeutic interventions.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Investigating the Mechanism of Hair Follicle Placode Induction : A novel approach to understanding establishment of the periodic pattern",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "In the field of regenerative medicine, while much work has been done to grow skin in culture, it has been\nespecially difficult to create cultured skin that is able to autonomously produce hair follicles in a biologically\naccurate fashion. Optimizing a way to grow fully functional skin in culture would revolutionize the way that the\nmedical field utilizes skin grafts and transplants. Especially in instances where there is insufficient transplant\ntissue to sample from, patients with severe burns, slow healing wounds, and advanced forms of scarring alopecia\nwould greatly benefit from being able to receive skin grafts and transplants derived from fully functional skin\nproduced in culture. Somehow, skin possesses an inherent ability to transform itself from a uniform sheet of\ntissue to an elegantly decorated structure with all of its necessary appendages organized in a periodic pattern.\nSeveral studies have been done to generate isolated follicle-like structures and even to stimulate a patch of hair\ngrowth in stem-cell derived tissue. The few instances of induced hair growth that have been accomplished in\nculture fall short of recapitulating hair follicle patterning de novo. We believe that better understanding how hair\nfollicles establish a periodic pattern during development will provide a strong framework for creating a way to\nmimic this phenomenon in culture. In the developmental biology field, the prevailing hypotheses that have been\nproposed to explain periodic pattern establishment rely heavily on local signaling and self-organization. Though,\nthere is insufficient experimental evidence to definitively support these hypotheses, which is also reflected in the\nchallenging feat to produce skin with hair follicles in culture. Data from our lab utilizing live imaging of embryonic\nskin development has uncovered remarkable plasticity in hair follicle placode induction, revealing an underlying\nprogram that ensures robust development of a periodic pattern. Informed by this data, I hypothesize that long-\ndistance migration mediated by Wnt signaling serves as the underlying mechanism for hair follicle placode\ninduction rather than being driven entirely by local activation and inhibition by diffusible ligands. I plan to test this\nhypothesis by utilizing the Cre-Lox system under the control of a K14 epithelial-specific promoter to stochastically\nknock out beta-catenin, an important Wnt signaling transcription factor. In this way, Wnt responsiveness will be\nmosaic in that some cells will be Wnt-responsive and others will not. I will then characterize hair follicle placodes\nin the mosaic Wnt-responsive system (Aim 1), determine the mechanism for how Wnt-responsive cells are able\nto migrate and coalesce to form a placode (Aim 2), and determine how Wnt signaling output is refined from a\nstochastic to periodic pattern in an unperturbed environment (Aim 3). This proposed project will provide\nexperimental evidence that has the potential to both lay the mechanistic foundation for more realistic skin culture\nexperiments and challenge long-standing hypotheses in the field. Through collaboration between Princeton\nUniversity, Robert Wood Johnson, and Weill Cornell Medicine, the proposed project and training plan is designed\nto provide the clinical, basic science training, mentorship, and resources necessary to accomplish this goal.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "High-Content Screen to Identify Small Molecule Therapeutics that Reduce Aberrant Lipid Accumulation in APOE4 Alzheimer's Disease",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary: Genome-wide association studies demonstrate that the top genes associated with\nincreased risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) are involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism, inferring\nlipid dysregulation is pathological. In particular, APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk for late-onset AD.\nIndividuals of European ancestry carrying two copies of the APOE4 allele have a sixteen-fold increase in AD risk\ncompared to a similar individual carrying two copies of the APOE3 allele. APOE is the primary cholesterol and\nlipid transporter in the brain. Studies using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) show that APOE4 alters\ncholesterol and lipid homeostasis across multiple cell types; however, its effects are especially pronounced in\noligodendrocytes\u2014myelinating cells that insulate and protect neurons. Histological and lipidomic profiling of\nhuman post-mortem brains and animal models shows impaired cholesterol transport and vast lipid deposits in\nAPOE4-expressing oligodendrocytes. This aberrant accumulation of lipids impairs myelination, impedes amyloid\nplaque clearance, and increases neuroinflammation. Despite the central role of APOE4 and lipid metabolism\nin AD, no therapeutics target APOE4 or aberrant lipid accumulation. MCM6 Therapeutics\u2019 Chief Science\nAdvisor, Dr. Joel Blanchard, an Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt.\nSinai, has developed a drug discovery pipeline that models APOE4 lipid accumulation in human\noligodendrocytes. In a small proof-of-concept screen, we discovered two mechanistically distinct drugs,\nrosiglitazone and cyclodextrin, both reduce lipid deposits in APOE4 oligodendrocytes. This reduction in\nintracellular lipid accumulation restored myelination in an in vitro neuron co-culture assay and improved learning\nand memory in APOE4 transgenic mice. We will further optimize and apply this high-content screening\npipeline to identify therapeutics that reduce aberrant cholesterol and lipid accumulation in human\nAPOE4 oligodendrocytes. Aim 1, we will adapt our screening assay to 384-well plates, and perform a targeted\nscreen of ~2,500 lipid modifying compounds. Our high-content image analysis platform will be conducted in\ncollaboration with PhenoVista. We expect the focused screening approach in Aim 1 will generate early leads and\ntargets that we will validate and expand on with structure-activity-relationship studies. Aim 2 we will perform a\nlarge unbiased screen of 30,000 compounds. Hits from Aims 1 and 2 will be validated via dose titration, and\nidentity will be confirmed by re-ordering and MS analysis. We will perform off-target analysis, functional validation\n(in vitro myelination), and neurotoxicity assays in iPSC-derived human brain tissue. Through rigorous in vitro\nvalidation of efficacy, selectivity, and neurotoxicity, we will select 3-10 lead compounds for future evaluation in\nour established APOE4 humanized mouse models through extensive histological and behavioral assays,\ndelivering first-in-class lead compounds that restore APOE4 brain lipid homeostasis, opening new therapeutic\nopportunities in AD.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT \nPeriodontal disease remains a significant public health problem. Chronic unresolved inflammation in response to proinflammatory oral microbiome dysbiosis induces host-mediated destruction of the periodontal tissues. Periodontal regeneration efforts have shown limited success due to the inability to resolve inflammation. Resolution of inflammation is initiated by Specialized Proresolving lipid Mediators (SPMs). SPMs include the lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, maresins, as well as their protein conjugates, which exhibit multipronged actions that improve the outcome of inflammation-related pathologies in experimental models and clinical trials. Human periodontal ligament stem cells human (PDLSC) release SPMs to regulate immunomodulatory and pro-healing properties. Among SPMs, Maresin 1 (MaR1) displays potent actions in regulating inflammation resolution and pain, wound repair and tissue regeneration. However, there is no defined mechanism by which MaR1 induces tissue regeneration, including bone. Our proposed research will address this gap by using a systems biology approach with LM-SPM metabolipidomics, and RNA-sequencing of PDLSC to discover possible pathways modulated by MaR1 in PDLSC tissue regeneration. By utilizing the American Yorkshire Pig as a large animal regeneration model, we will test the therapeutic potential of MaR1-enhanced PDLSC therapy for regeneration of periodontal tissues for translation to humans. Three specific aims are proposed: 1) To establish MaR1 biosynthetic pathway in PDLSC. 2) To define the mechanism by which MaR1 controls tissue regeneration. 3a) To demonstrate MaR1-enhanced PDLSC-mediated periodontal regeneration in the Pig. 3b) To elucidate the impact of MaR1 on combined BMP2-PDLSC treatment in the Pig. Results from these studies will address a mission of NIDCR: \u201dto support the development of human disease- and injury-relevant animal models for tissue regeneration of the oral and craniofacial complex, with preference given to large animal models.\u201d \nThe candidate is a dentist-scientist and is currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Texas Health San Antonio. This proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and training plan to advance the candidate\u2019s skills and knowledge in immunology, metabolipidomics, RNA-sequencing and translational science under the guidance of a strong team of NIH-funded scientists; Dr. Kenneth Hargreaves, Dr. Stephen Harris, Dr. Charles Serhan and Dr. George Huang. The proposal builds on the candidate\u2019s previous research in stem cells, BMP2 and periodontium formation by integrating new areas of expertise. The plan includes a mentored phase designed to optimize learning and acquisition of new skills (K99) followed by the R00 phase, which is specifically designed to capitalize on the strengths of the applicant to develop a new path of research that will determine the role of resolution of inflammation and stem cells in BMP2 mediated regeneration. The R00 phase also includes residency training. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will position the candidate with a unique set of cross disciplinary skills that will enable her to transition to independence specializing in stem cell-based periodontal tissue regenerative therapies.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT\nAltered GABAergic interneurons have been documented following genetic and environmental perturbations in Autism\nSpectrum Disorder (ASD) suggesting that GABAergic interneurons might be particularly susceptible and contribute to\nASD pathophysiology. We identified Caspr2, a neuronal protein to be a target of 3 monoclonal IgG derived from\nmothers with anti-brain antibodies (Ab) with an ASD child, and found that ~40% of mothers with anti-brain Ab harbor\nanti-Caspr2 IgG. Caspr2 expression is localized during development to proliferating progenitor cells of pyramidal\nneurons in the ventricular zone and to the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) where somatostatin and parvalbumin\ninterneurons (PVI) arise. It is involved in stabilization of dendrites and synapses and is an ASD risk gene. Its brain\nexpression is similar between females and males throughout gestation. We have demonstrated that exposure in utero\nto either human monoclonal anti-Caspr2 IgG or polyclonal anti-Caspr2 IgG results in male offspring with structural\nand behavioral alterations. Female offspring show no such alterations. Here we focus on the immunization model in\nwhich female mice are immunized with the extracellular domain of human Caspr2 and harbor endogenous polyclonal\nanti-Caspr2 Abs throughout gestation. Male mice exposed in utero to anti-Caspr2 IgG (\u201cAnti-Caspr2\u201d) exhibit a specific\nreduction in PVIs but not in number of other hippocampal interneurons such as somatostatin, calretinin and\ncholecystokinin in the CA1 region of the hippocampus compared to adjuvant immunized control mice (\u201cControl\u201d). The\nreduction in PVIs is evident at postnatal age P21 and is not accompanied by a reduction in total number of GABAergic\ncells. The reduction in PVIs in Anti-Caspr2 male mice is not explained by a reduction in PV progenitor cells or altered\nmigration, as number of proliferating and apoptotic progenitor interneurons in the MGE and the number of migratory\nMGE interneurons is similar between Control and Anti-Caspr2 male mice. Given the contribution of PVIs to gamma\noscillations, we implanted multi-electrodes in Anti-Caspr2 male mice, targeted to the striata oriens and pyramidale,\nand calculated relative power of the gamma band. Anti-Caspr2 male mice exhibit a significant increase in mid and\nhigh gamma oscillations. Taken together, the model permits a study of the impact of PVIs during development as they\npertain to ASD. Our hypothesis is that in utero exposure to anti-Caspr2 Abs has sex specific epigenetic effects on PVI\nmaturation, which contribute to network imbalance in male mice.\n We therefore propose to study:\n1. Whether the reduction in PV expression in the CA1 region of the hippocampus is associated with epigenetic\n changes that disrupt the normal transcriptional profile of PVIs in male but not female Anti-Caspr2 mice.\n2. When abnormal PVIs network patterns develop in Anti-Caspr2 mice and what are the functional consequence\n of disrupting PVI development using ex vivo hippocampal slices.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract\nMany debilitating neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are caused by a deficiency or excess of a specific gene\nproduct. Most of these disorders are treated at the symptomatic level, without targeting the underlying cause.\nMany efforts have been made to systematically find drugs that can modulate the responsible gene product and\ncorrect the imbalance. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, fueled by the vast amount of publicly available data,\ncan prioritize the most promising treatments to test.\nThere are tens of thousands of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) studies from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)\nthat give a quantitative readout of many gene and drug perturbations. If a chemical changes a cell\u2019s transcriptome\nsimilarly or oppositely to the disruption of a specific gene, the drug might support or counteract the gene\u2019s\nfunction. Large-scale analyses of discrete pathway data and transcriptomic studies have been used to discover\nnovel protein regulators, and even successful NDD therapeutics. However, their ability to expedite screens for\nNDD therapies has not been quantitatively tested. This project will use AI to curate and analyze the literature\nand RNA-seq data, and predict the most likely genetic and pharmacologic regulators of single genes.\nAim 1 will assess whether a fully automated prediction pipeline effectively prioritizes regulators of methyl-CpG-\nbinding protein 2 (MeCP2). MeCP2 is an ideal target upon which to systematically validate predictions. It is a\ndosage-sensitive protein that is widely studied and perturbed. Patients with MeCP2 deficiency (Rett syndrome)\nand excess (MECP2 duplication syndrome) are given symptomatic therapies, and treatments for its imbalance\nare being developed, but there is no definitive remedy, and affected individuals continue to die in childhood or\nlive with cognitive and motor defects. Drugs that correct the imbalance could help affected individuals, especially\nif given in their infancy, before all symptoms emerge and set in. This aim will involve using neuronal lines from\nan individual with Rett syndrome to test the top 20 predictions of MeCP2-regulating genes and drugs. Testing\nthe top treatments without any manual filtering will determine whether this predictor effectively prioritizes\nsuccessful MeCP2 regulators.\nAdditionally, parts of a disease signature might be pathogenic, and others protective. There thus remains a need\nto find druggable subnetworks within a gene disruption signature. Aim 2 will establish a network analysis that\ncan find separate network modules surrounding a given gene, and drugs that specifically target those modules.\nThis study will identify promising treatments that can be repurposed to rescue developmental defects in\nindividuals with Rett syndrome, as well as genes that serve as upstream regulators of MeCP2. On a larger scale,\nit will quantitatively assess the ability of AI-guided predictions to expedite the search for undiscovered drug-gene\nrelationships. This will save a tremendous amount of time and resources in the search for therapeutics for\nmonogenic NDDs, and pave the way to making more of these disorders treatable.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Novel brain-penetrant drugs for translation-targeting therapeutics of Alzheimer\u2019s disease",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\n Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia in older adults, is a neurodegenerative\ndisorder characterized by progressive decline of memory and cognition. AD is multifaceted and heterogeneous,\nwhich prevents clear mechanistic understanding of AD pathogenesis and therefore hinders development of\neffective therapeutics. Meanwhile, post-mortem epidemiology indicated that AD onset was associated with\nelevated activity of the histone methyltransferase G9a (EHMT2) in diseased brain,\nimplicating\nG9a activity-\nassociated pathways in AD pathogenesis. Using our c\nhromatin-activity-based chemoproteomic (ChaC)\napproach that enables dissection of AD heterogeneity\n, we (the Chen lab) have discovered a noncanonical,\ntranslation regulatory function of G9a in AD pathogenesis. Further, we deduced the mechanism of action of a\nbrain-penetrant G9a-targetd drug,\nMS1262,\nw\nhere G9a inhibition by MS1262 reversed\nAD patient proteomes,\nparticularly the AD-disturbed expression or phosphorylation of proteins related to cognition and learning, synaptic\ntransmission, synaptogenesis, and hyperactive behavior. Correspondingly, intermittent\nMS1262 treatment\nrestored cognitive and affective functions in mid/late-stage 5xFAD mice to the healthy level (p <0.0027). Thus,\nwe will develop a new mechanism-based AD therapeutics. TransChromix, LLC, a startup company created by\nthe NC Kick-Start program, and Professor Xian Chen at the UNC School of Medicine, will conduct this project.\n Our preliminary results show that MS1262 therapy of AD is clinically practical: Comparison of proteomic\nanalyses of MS1262-treated AD mice with human data from large cohorts of AD patients revealed that MS1262\nreversed the patient proteomic landscapes that were highly correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline.\nThis mouse-to-human conservation of G9a-translated AD proteomes suggests that the therapeutic effects of\nMS1262 in mice could extend to AD patients. Thus, we will test the hypothesis that targeting G9a-mediated\ntranslational mechanisms using brain-penetrant drugs is a specific and effective strategy to prevent and/or\nreverse AD progression. In Phase I, we will test the hypothesis that targeting G9a-mediated translational\nmechanisms using MS1262 is a specific and effective strategy to prevent and/or reverse AD progression.\nSpecifically, in the\nMS1262\n-treated AD mouse models including 5xFAD mice and other established AD mouse\nmodels at different stages of AD progression we will (1) comprehensively determine the long-term efficacy and\nthe specificity of MS1262 on synaptic and cognitive function,\n(2)\nmeasure inhibitor toxicity and brain specificity\nby dose range finding and pharmacokinetic studies, and (3) validate the clinical accuracy of G9a inhibitory\nmechanism. In\nPhase II\nwe will use the Phase I-optimized doses with low toxicity to test the treatment efficacy\nfor AD patients. Meanwhile, we will develop companion diagnostic assays to stratify patients for enhanced\ntherapy with high response rates. The end deliverable of phase II funding will be an FDA IND application.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract/Summary\nThe goal of this application is to further develop a first-in-class therapeutic regimen that attenuates\naging of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Aging of hematopoiesis in older adults often\nmanifests as aging-associated anemia, progressive reduction in the immune response, and/or\nincreased incidence of myeloid malignancy. These aging associated declines are in part attributed to\nthe aging of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic system that sustain our life-long\nproduction of quality red blood cells, immune cells and white blood cells. Previous studies have\nestablished, mostly in murine models, that elevated Cdc42 activity and loss of cell polarity serve as\naging associated biomarkers for HSCs and targeting Cdc42 activity via a lead small molecule Cdc42-\nactivity specific inhibitor, CASIN, can dose-dependently suppress elevated Cdc42 activity and loss of\npolarity of aged animals to functionally rejuvenate or attenuate aging of murine HSCs. CASIN thus has\nthe potential to be further developed towards clinical applications to benefit human aging. The central\nhypothesis of this proposal is that targeting Cdc42 activity with the drug CASIN can restored Cdc42-\nregulated polarity and rejuvenate aged human HSCs ex vivo, which will benefit bone marrow HSC\ntransplant patients. The proposed studies will develop the proof-of-principle of an intervention to\nrejuvenate aged blood forming system and validate CASIN in rejuvenating aged human HSC epigenetic\nclock and function at well-defined ex vivo conditions. The proposal will also test a clinically applicable\nclosed circuit HSC manipulation apparatus for CASIN ex vivo treatment in future commercialization of\nthis technology. Upon completion of the proposed studies, we expect our product will move closer to\nFDA IND filing and clinical trials in preventing or treating aging related functional decline of human\nblood system to benefit the lives of older adults.",

The international meeting on Myogenesis has\nhistorically been viewed as one of the preeminent skeletal muscle meetings, attracting speakers and attendees\nfrom around the world. A major goal of the 2025 Conference is to identify mechanisms that contribute to both\nhealthy physiological function and, when dysregulated, muscle pathology during aging or disease. Leaders in\nthe field will present recent unpublished data to educate conference attendees while stimulating interactive\ndiscussion amongst the group. Additional program events including poster sessions, scheduled social events,\nlocal outings, organized mentoring and networking tables at mealtimes, and informal gatherings in the\nafternoons will ensure maximal levels of interaction between established scientists and junior\nscientists/trainees: this meeting has historically been rated by attendees as extremely informal and collegial\nwith excellent interactions between trainees and more senior researchers. Thus, we expect the 2025\nMyogenesis GRC will provide an ideal scenario to stimulate new breakthroughs in muscle biology and to\nbenefit attendees at every professional level. In addition, four afternoon and evening poster sessions will\nstimulate interactions between all attendees. We will also provide education, networking opportunities, and\ncareer path mentoring to junior scientists through the GRS, a two-day conference program targeting graduate\nstudents and postdocs that takes place immediately preceding the GRC. The GRS will conduct four sessions\nof talks and two poster sessions by graduate students and postdocs. Moreover, during the GRC, 4 sessions of\n\"poster previews\" will provide a forum for junior scientists to highlight their work and receive feedback from\nother participants (approximately 50% of trainees attending will present in this forum). These activities\nrepresent a unique opportunity for the next generation of scientists to present their research on myogenesis,\ninteract with their peers, and form new collaborations. Achieving these aims will place the field in a better\nposition to accelerate the advancement of muscle biology and thus the development of new avenues to\npromote muscle health. The venue of the conference at Il Ciocco Italy offers a relaxing atmosphere conducive\nto creative thinking and the exchange of ideas that will benefit attendees at every professional level. Thus, we\nexpect the 2025 Myogenesis Gordon Research Conference will provide both a stimulating program and an\nideal setting for attendees to advance their understanding of skeletal muscle biology.",

In\nthis proposal, our central focus lies in exploring the LOY-aging nexus. Utilizing both computational and hands-\non experimental strategies, we aim to achieve an integrated understanding of LOY. This encompasses novel\nmethodological innovations, rare variant association studies, and a meticulous probe into the mechanism binding\nLOY with aging. By diving deep into this specific genome irregularity, we aspire to shed light on the intricate\neffects of genetic factors that play out as we age. Our overarching goal revolves around demystifying the\ninterconnections between LOY, genome instability as one ages, and the onset of age-related diseases. Our\nresearch hinges on two foundational hypotheses: first, that rare genetic variants play a pivotal role in LOY's\nmanifestation, shaping its appearance against the backdrop of polygenic risks set by more common variants;\nand second, that LOY isn't an isolated event, but a piece in the larger puzzle of age-associated genome\ninstability. These suppositions draw strength from our preliminary data, garnered using SNP array genotyping\nand whole exome sequencing from the Einstein longevity cohort. This invaluable dataset previously enabled us\nto identify links between rare genetic variants and exceptional human longevity. We now set forth three distinct\naims: to ascertain the extent of LOY mosaicism using sequencing data; to pinpoint genes heightening LOY risk;\nand, most crucially, to decode the relationship between LOY and aging. We firmly believe that a holistic\nunderstanding of LOY's genetic blueprint and the mechanics tying it to aging will serve as a gateway to\nunderstanding age-related pathology. A deeper insight into LOY will not only allow for precise quantification but\nalso pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies, potentially offering a novel approach to mitigate the\nchallenges of aging and age-associated diseases.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Investigating single-T cell atopic gene networks in Asian and Hispanic genetic backgrounds\nProject Summary/Narrative\nImmunomodulatory therapies now robustly improve atopic dermatitis, based on selective targeting of cytokine\npathways. However, no immune cell-specific molecular biomarkers can currently differentiate disease states at\nthe level of individual patients or genetic ancestries, to help guide treatment selection. Our long-term objective\nis to understand causes and effective treatments for atopic dermatitis in Asian and Hispanic genetic\nbackgrounds. The objective of this proposal is to identify genetic biases in, and functionally characterize, a set\nof abnormally elevated transcripts in atopic dermatitis skin T cells, which we recently discovered in a cohort of\nAsian and Hispanic patients. Our central hypothesis is that transcriptional abnormalities in skin-resident T cells\nare upstream, causative drivers in atopic dermatitis and once validated, represent candidate biomarkers for\ndrug response. The rationale underlying this proposal is that prior work suggests that non-European cohorts\ndevelop atopic dermatitis via genetic pathways outside canonical Th2/Tc2 signaling, a model not supported by\nour preliminary data. We will validate our abnormal atopic T cell signature in Asian and Hispanic cohorts and\nexperimentally test our hypothesis that specific genes in this signature can produce a Th2 cell identity. We will\npursue these aims using innovative technical approaches that include both CRISPR/Cas9-based gene\nactivation in primary T cells and single-cell spatial transcriptomics, bringing new capabilities to the skin\nimmunology field. Our proposal is significant because it investigates patient-level biomarkers in atopic\ndermatitis T cells in diverse genetic backgrounds. The expected outcome of this proposal is a population- and\nmechanism-validated set of genetic abnormalities that typify atopic dermatitis in Asian and Hispanic patients.\nThese data will have a positive impact on clinical treatments because they will guide treatments to reduce the\nsubstantial morbidity and economic impact stemming from atopic dermatitis in non-European patients.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\u2014Cell State Network-Directed Therapy\nDrug resistance is a significant challenge in cancer therapy and has historically been addressed from \u201cone step\nbehind\u201d, whereby drug(s) become progressively ineffective, resistance mechanism(s) are studied, and then\ndifferent drug(s) are used. While genetic and other resistance pathways are well-appreciated, so-called cell state\nplasticity is increasingly understood to be a major determinant of resistance. Cell state is typically defined by a\ntranscriptome pattern, and plasticity is mediated largely by dynamic epigenetic transitions that mimic\ndevelopmental or tissue homeostasis programs. The different cell states along with the transitions between them\ncomprise a cell state network. Because different cell states can have unique drug sensitivities and resistances,\nand cells can change state dynamically through the network, cell state networks provide flexible resistance\nmechanisms. This proposal seeks to design therapies based on cell state network dynamics, such that drug\nsensitive states are promoted while limiting transitions to drug-resistant states. However, an agnostic\nexperimental screening approach for drug combinations is extremely challenging, even considering just two\ndrugs and the hundreds of FDA-approved anti-cancer compounds, not to mention inter-patient heterogeneity,\ndoses, and timing/sequence. Computational models that predict how tumor cell populations respond to drug\ncombinations could help fill this gap, but so far this has been a challenging problem, even for modern machine\nlearning methods. Our preliminary work shows combining knowledge of cell state transition network dynamics\nand single drug dose responses could enable computational prediction of how varied drug combinations\ninfluence cell population growth dynamics, and how a sufficient and attainable set of data enables unique\ninference of cell state networks. These motivate our proposal to predict and test \u201ccell state network-directed\u201d\ntherapies, with particular focus on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a brain tumor with poor survival and few\ntreatment options. We propose four Aims to study 3 different patient-derived xenograft models of GBM with in\nvivo-like tumor-chip systems: Aim 1. Develop Glioma Cell State Network Models; Aim 2. Determine How\nMicroenvironmental Factors Alter Cell State Networks; Aim 3. Determine How Glioma Cell State Networks\nRespond to Single Drugs; and Aim 4. Evaluate Model-Predicted Combination Therapies in Cell Culture and\nTumor Chips. We will combine computational modeling with state-of-the-art single cell RNAseq, spatial\ntranscriptomics, and flow cytometry to characterize cell state networks in gliomas and their dynamics, and how\nthey respond to a variety of glioma-relevant chemotherapy drugs. We will then use these models to propose\nefficacious regimens that not only control growth but favorably modulate cell state transitions, and test them\nusing in-vivo like tumor chips. Furthermore, we will study how spatial arrangements of cell types and co-cultures\nwith primary neurons influence glioma behavior. Although the application is GBM, cell state networks are a\nuniversal feature of cancer so findings here may have widespread significance across human cancers.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nBreast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths of women in the United States and worldwide.\nImmunotherapy is a promising approach, but has not proven successful yet in metastatic breast cancer,\nparticularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is the most aggressive subtype among all breast cancer\nsubtypes, with little treatment options available. First-line treatment with pembrolizumab\u2013chemotherapy results in\nbetter overall survival than chemotherapy alone among patients with advanced TNBC. Sacituzumab Govitecan is\noffered as an option for the second line of treatment. Despite these significant progresses, most patients eventually\ncollapse and die without further treatment option. Thus, TNBC remains an unmet medical need for urgent\ndevelopment of novel therapeutics. The rationale for this application is that clinical responses to immune\ncheckpoint therapy rely on the presence of tumor-infiltrating and antigen-specific T cells. Thus, development of\ntumor-specific TCR-T cell immunotherapy is key to the success of immunotherapy in breast cancer. Immunova\nTherapeutics is a startup company with the mission to further develop TCR-T cell immunotherapy for the treatment\nof solid cancers, including TNBC. Due to the nature of tumor heterogeneity, antigen loss or negative tumor variants\nrepresents a key mechanism to develop resistance to immunotherapy. This IMT-422 product is an HLA-DR13-\nrestricted KK-LC-1-specific TCR-engineered CD4+ T cells, and has been demonstrated to completely inhibit or\neven eliminate TNBC in a mouse model. Our finding is also supported by recent studies showing that CD4+ T cells\ncould eliminate antigen-positive and -negative tumor cells. To further improve the therapeutic potential, we\nengineered TCR with three key technologies to increase the pools of stem-like memory T cells and resistance to\nT cell exhaustion and immune suppression. We named the final IMT-422 product as CD4 TCR-STEM T cells,\nwhich could completely reject breast cancer growth in a mouse model. Based on these solid data, we propose to\ngenerate GMP grade Master Cell Bank (MCB) and viral particles of TCR-STEM required for Chemistry,\nManufacturing and Controls (CMC) (Aim 1); and determine the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and\npharmacological toxicity of the IMT-422 (CD4 TCR-STEM T cells) product (Aim 2). Upon completion of the\nproposed studies, we are well positioned to initiate and file an investigator-initiated new drug (IND) application for\na future phase I clinical trial, thus accelerating the development of new breast cancer immunotherapy.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "ACVR1 sensory neuron-specific signaling in neuropathic pain and injury-induced heterotopic ossification",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nDebilitating pain, a hallmark of tissue injury and neuropathy, is an unmet clinical challenge particularly in\nmusculoskeletal diseases, such as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur following orthopedic surgery\nand traumatic injuries, manifests with pathological bone formation in muscle and connective tissues. However,\nlittle progress has been made in developing effective treatments for either HO or its associated pain.\nPersistent neuropathic pain can arise from hyperexcitability of sensory neuron nociceptors in dorsal root\nganglia (DRG), which release neuropeptides, interact with immune cells, and modulate the host response\nafter injury to innervated tissues including bone and muscle. A critical link between bone homeostasis and\nneuropathic pain has been suggested by the impaired ossification and bone loss in mice lacking Trpv1+\nnociceptors. Although the mechanisms that underlie HO formation or HO related pain are poorly understood,\nimportant insights derive from studies of an hereditary HO subset, namely Fibrodysplasia Ossificans\nProgressiva (FOP). FOP is commonly caused by an arginine206 to histidine gain-of-function point mutation in\nthe BMP type I receptor (ACVR1, also known as ALK2) in 97% of patients. We recently found that adult\npatients with FOP have baseline heat and mechanical hypersensitivity, in the absence of an inflammatory\nflareup. Utilizing FOP patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived nociceptive sensory neurons\n(iSNs), we demonstrated that ACVR1R206H is both necessary and sufficient for the hyperexcitability of\nnociceptors, a hallmark of neuropathic pain. To determine whether neuronal ACVR1 hyperactivity is also\nrelevant to more common neuropathic pain conditions, we conditionally expressed activating Acvr1R206H in\nsensory neurons of non-FOP transgenic mice. This led to a remarkable recapitulation of the mechanical and\nheat hypersensitivity in patients with FOP. As Acvr1 expression is profoundly increased in axotomized DRG\nneurons in a traditional preclinical model of neuropathic pain produced by spared nerve injury (SNI), we found\nthat inhibiting injury-induced active neuronal ACVR1 signaling in the DRG by intrathecal (IT) injections of a\nsmall-molecule ACVR1/ALK2 kinase inhibitor prevented injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and, most\nimportantly, reversed persistent pain in the mouse SNI model. Based on our observation that trauma-induced\nHO triggered massive nociceptor sprouting at the injury site in a preclinical mouse model of FOP, we further\nhypothesize that active ACVR1 signaling in sensory neurons is a critical link between neuropathic pain and\nHO. Together, aiming to elucidate the mechanisms downstream of active ACVR1 signaling, mechanisms that\nmay be shared by other chronic pain and musculoskeletal injury conditions; while developing new treatment\nstrategies, we will define molecular targets of sensory neuron-specific ACVR1 that contribute to neuropathic\npain (Aim 1); validate if inhibiting peripheral neuronal ACVR1 reduces hypersensitivity (Aim 2); and determine\nif sensory neuron-specific ACVR1 contributes to injury-induced HO (Aim 3).",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Genome editing holds great promise for the treatment of many genetic diseases; however its application in the\nclinic has been slow due to the lack of the safe delivery tools and significant cost and time investment required\nto custom-develop individual therapies. In our SCGE program phase 1 study, we developed a chemically\nmodified ribonucleoprotein (cRNP)-based gene delivery system that specifically targets neuronal cells\nthroughout the brain after intrathecal (IT) administration. The overarching goal of this application is to apply this\nnovel gene editing technology towards the treatment of two severe neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD):\nAngelman syndrome (AS) and H1-4 syndrome (HIST1H1E syndrome). AS is a devastating neurodevelopmental\ndisease caused by the deficiency of the maternal and brain specific imprinting UBE3A gene in human\nchromosome 15q11-q13 region. The structure of UBE3A is intact in the paternal chromosome in all AS cases\nbut transcriptionally repressed by a non-coding and antisense RNA of UBE3A (UBE3A-ATS) mediated\nmechanism. It has been shown convincingly that reduction of UBE3A-ATS by antisense oligo (ASO),\ntopoisomerase inhibitors, and virus delivered Cas9 gene editing can de-repress the expression of UBE3A and\ncorrect the abnormal neurological phenotypes in AS mouse models. H1-4 syndrome is caused by a gain of\nfunction mechanism due to a mutated protein with aberrant C-terminal frameshift tail (CFT). H1-4 syndrome has\nsimilar but milder clinical features than AS. There is no effective intervention for H1-4 syndrome. Thus, a long-\nterm molecular therapy for AS and H1-4, as well as other NDDs is urgently needed. In our preclinical study using\na well validated AS mouse model, we demonstrated that a single IT delivery of Ube3a antisense-targeting\nRNP/Cas9efficiently de-represses the expression of Ube3a from the paternal chromosome, leading to correction\nof neurobehavioral phenotypes. Similarly, the knockdown of H1-4 CFT rescue the abnormal phenotypes in H1-\n4 humanized mice. We propose our cRNP-based platform for the treatment of AS and H1-4 syndrome utilizing\nthe same genome editor (CRISPR), delivery system (cRNPs), route (IT), target cell type (neurons), therapeutic\nmechanism (genetic inactivation) and overall trial design. We have assembled an outstanding team from Yale\nand Rush University with strong and complementary expertise in the areas of preclinical, IND enabling studies,\nand clinical trials. The success of this study will lead to the first ever gene editing based therapy for AS and H1-\n4. More importantly, it will support a paradigm shift for genome editing; rapidly expanding the number of\nneurogenetic diseases treated by in vivo gene editing and accelerating the transition of genome editing\ntechnology into clinical applications.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "The role of HIV Vif in clonal hematopoiesis and malignant transformation (HIV-Associated Cancers in Aging Populations)",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "We accrue somatic mosaicism with age in many tissues. In the blood system, this is called clonal hematopoiesis\n(CH). CH is a premalignant condition in which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) accrue 1-2 mutations among\n~20 genes such as DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1. The CH clone size and the rate at which clones expand, which\nare promoted by external factors such as inflammation, are strong predictors of malignant transformation of CH\ninto hematologic malignancies. Consistently, inflammation has been shown to promote the progression of CH to\nhematologic malignancies. HIV-infected patients exhibit signatures of enhanced inflammation, such as activated\nimmune cells and cytokine expression, even when the patients are treated with antiretroviral therapies (ART).\nIndeed, people living with HIV (PLWH) have higher incidence of CH, particularly those with ASXL1 mutations,\nthan HIV negative population. Notably, PLWH have a higher risk of developing hematologic malignancies such\nas non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), suggesting an association between\nthe elevated CH prevalence among PLWH and its malignant transformation. The fact that PLWH treated with\nART have high incidence of CH raises a possibility that HIV infection promotes CH independently of viral load or\ninflammation. HIV-infected human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been found in PLWH, further\nsupporting the possibility that HIV infection may alter HSC function cell intrinsically to confer competitive\nadvantages to mutant HSCs. The objective of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underpinning\nthe increased prevalence of CH and its transformation to malignancies among PLWH. In Aim 1, we will study\nwhether Asxl1 mutant HSCs expands upon HIV infection. In Aim 2, we will examine whether HIV infection\ntransforms Asxl1 mutant HSCs to myeloid neoplasms. Completion of this study will provide novel insights into\nthe effects of HIV infection on clonal expansion and subsequent transformation of Asxl1 mutant HSCs.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nPersistent immune activation is the defining feature of HIV-1 infection in vivo and a driver of progression to end-\nstage AIDS. Systemic immune activation in people living with HIV (PWH) has been hypothesized to account for\nhigher incidence of chronic inflammatory diseases, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND).\nImportantly, numerous studies have demonstrated that populations living with opioid-use disorder (OUD) have\na higher occurrence of comorbid HIV infection, suggesting both potential socio-economic and neurocognitive\ninfluence. This comorbidity of OUD and HIV has also been shown to increase neuroinflammation and exacerbate\nthe progression of HIV infection and HAND. The proposal will primarily focus on macrophages and CNS-resident\ninnate immune cell, microglia, which both serve as the primary virus reservoirs in the CNS. While some studies\nhave investigated the interactive effects of OUD and HAND in myeloid cells of non-human origin or transgenic\nrodent models, the molecular mechanisms linking the two conditions in primary human microglia is still largely\nunknown. Hence, we believe, this proposal fulfills a critical unmet need by establishing primary human iPSC-\nderived microglia cultures to systematically interrogate the effect of HIV infection and opioids on inflammasome\nactivation. This application will attempt to delineate the molecular mechanisms by which HIV-1 infection activates\ninflammasome activation in microglia and how opioid exposure degrades auto-inhibitory mechanisms that\nrestrain spontaneous activation of the inflammasome, and is responsive to the FOA, \u201cTargeting\nInflammasomes in Substance Abuse and HIV (RFA-DA-24-003)\u201d. We will utilize detailed molecular and\nmechanistic analysis to identify the microglia-intrinsic pathway that primes and activates NLRP1 inflammasome\nupon co-exposure to HIV and opiates. Specifically, we will determine if HIV-1 intron-containing RNA (icRNA)\nexpression and binding of HIV-1 icRNA by NLRP1 in microglia induces inflammasome activation. We will next\ndetermine if opioid exposure enhances expression of HIV icRNA in microglia and promotes a cellular danger\nstate to erode negative regulatory mechanisms that prevent spurious NLRP1 inflammasome activation in\nmicroglia. We postulate that these proposed experiments will identify a microglia-intrinsic mechanism of NLRP1\ninflammasome activation driven by HIV icRNA expression and opioid exposure that fuels neuroinflammation and\nHAND. Importantly, results from these studies will inform future therapeutic development to prevent HIV and\nopiate-induced neuroinflammation and prevent development of HAND in HIV+ substance use population.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nOverall, the world population is aging and in the era of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) people living with HIV\n(PLWH) live longer. ART has converted HIV infection into a survivable chronic infection; however,\ncomorbidities are a mounting clinical reality, likely related to accelerated immunosenescence. It is well\ndocumented that HIV infection leads to accelerated aging, and HIV-1 chronic infection is considered a good\nmodel for studying immunosenescence. The impact of aging on increased susceptibility to infections and\nreduced responsiveness to vaccines is a well-known clinical problem. Antibodies are one of the first and most\nimportant responses against pathogens and the reason for this dampened immune response with aging may\nbe due to age-related reduced humoral immunity (B cell immunosenescence). Humoral immunity has been\nunderstudied in humans, particularly in lymphoid tissue, due to the difficulty of sample availability. It is not clear\nhow accurately changes observed in blood reflect immunosenescence processes in tissues, especially the\ngastrointestinal mucosa which contains most of the body\u2019s lymphocytes (~60%) and it is a region of high\nantigen exposure. Therefore, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) represents a good model to study\nlymphoid tissue in humans that is highly exposed to antigen stimulation. A growing body of literature has begun\nto reveal the pathophysiological processes driving immune dysfunction of T cells, including work by our team,\nwhich has studied the human mucosal immune compartment. It is not well understood how aging depresses\nhumoral immunity and there are little or no studies on humoral immunity in the mucosal immune compartment.\nCompared to blood, gut mucosa contains fewer na\u00efve cells, more activated memory cell, and more antibody\nsecreting cells, consistent with the high level of antigen exposure. Therefore, in this study, we propose to\nanalyze the individual and combined impact of age and HIV-1 on immunosenescence of humoral\nimmunity, especially in the highly immune active gastrointestinal tract, by quantifying B-cell immune\naging in GALT and peripheral blood in PLWH, as a model of accelerated aging, and in people without\nHIV (PWOH). Our hypothesis is that natural aging and HIV-1-induced-accelerated aging diminishes the\ncapacity of the immune system to produce efficient antibody responses in the periphery and GALT; this will be\na result of inappropriate accumulation of memory-effector T-cells fueled by chronic persistent viral infections,\ncausing ineffective follicular helper T-cells, inefficient recall of cytotoxic responses, and a generalized,\npersistent low-level inflammatory state. The Specific Aims to test this hypothesis are: Aim 1: To determine\nage-related B cell lymphocyte senescence in the GALT versus peripheral blood compartments of PWOH and\nPLWH ranging in age from 18 to \u226560-65 years. We will also study the functional aspects of B cells in terms of\nantibody production and B cell receptor repertoire. Aim 2: To determine if the accelerated B lymphocyte\nsenescence seen in GALT affects humoral responses, using SARS-CoV-2 as a neoantigen challenge model.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nThe combined opioid and stimulant use epidemic is an escalating public health emergency with numerous\nbiological and psychological drivers and consequences, which are amplified in people with HIV (PWH) and other\nmarginalized groups. We and others have described significant immune alterations in PWH and individuals that\ninject opioids and/or stimulants including increased systemic inflammation and lymphocyte dysregulation,\nincluding among B cells. This heighted inflammatory state and distorted B cell function likely contribute to\nincreased risk and severity of infections and inflammatory co-morbidities including cardiovascular, kidney, liver,\nand autoimmune diseases. Although anti-retroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV, its ability to restore immune\nhomeostasis is incomplete, resulting in accelerated immunological aging and associated co-morbidities;\nsubsequently development of adjunctive interventions to mitigate these complications is ongoing. Active\nsubstance use, intoxication, and related behaviors associated with injection drug use can impact HIV viral\ndynamics and immune competency. Among people who inject drugs (PWID) that do not have HIV, there is a\nhigh risk for acquiring HIV, clear indications of reduced effectiveness of HIV vaccines, and altered viral dynamics\nin the acute stage of HIV infection; these unique factors highlight the challenges of HIV vaccine development for\nPWID. There is an unmet need for interventions that can restore immune homeostasis in PWID in order to\nimprove responses to pathogens and minimize inflammatory-related co-morbidities. Metformin (MTF), the most\nwidely prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes (T2D), may be such an intervention. Animal and human studies have\ndemonstrated MTFs ability to reduce inflammation and enhance vaccine responses. Our central hypothesis is\nthat MTF can mitigate the inflammation and immune dysregulation that is prevalent in PWID including among\nPWH, restoring immune homeostasis and responsiveness. This will be addressed through a placebo controlled,\nrandomized clinical trial of MTF in PWH and non-PWH with a history of recent injection drug use including opioids\nand stimulants. Assessment of Hepatitis A/B and pneumococcal vaccine responses during this trial will allow\nexamination of adaptive responses to pathogens of concern within these populations and serve as a surrogate\nfor assessing their potential response to a future HIV vaccine. Vaccine outcomes will provide a metric to\ncomplement the integrated behavioral and high-resolution functional analysis of systemic and mucosal\ninflammation and immunity, providing mechanistic insights relevant to HIV prevention and pathogenesis. Our\nhypothesis will be addressed through the following aims: 1) determine the ability of MTF to mitigate inflammation\nand improve vaccine response in PWID, 2) determine the ability of MTF to normalize B cell phenotype and\nfunction in PWID, and 3) determine the influence of MTF on mucosal inflammation and immunity.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "The impact of antiretroviral therapy on fetal immune system development in SIV-exposed rhesus macaques",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "SUMMARY\n The use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnant women living with HIV is an effective way to prevent\nmother-to-child transmission. However, HIV-exposed, but uninfected (HEU) children experience higher mortality\nfrom common infections and severe respiratory disease. However, the independent and combinatorial effects of\nHIV and ART on fetal immune cell development remain unknown. We propose to utilize the well-established\nrhesus macaque model of ART-treated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection to test our hypothesis that\nmaternal SIV and ART exert differential effects on the development and maturation of the fetal immune\nsystem, resulting in dysregulated functional responses. To address the differential effects of suppressed\nSIV infection and ART, we will study three experimental groups of females. In the SIV/ART group, females will\nbe infected with SIV and then suppressed with ART before undergoing timed-mated breeding. We will have two\ncontrol groups: an ART-only group and an untreated/uninfected healthy pregnancy group. We acknowledge that\nthe ART-only group is not a clinically relevant scenario, but necessary in the context of the proposed studies to\ndistinguish the contribution of ART per se to the fetal immune phenotype exhibited by the offspring of SIV/ART\ndams. We do not have an untreated SIV-infected group, as this is not relevant to the vast majority of pregnant\nWLWH. GD130-135 fetuses will be obtained via Caesarean section and studied as outlined in the following\nSpecific Aims. Aim 1. Determine the effects of maternal SIV/ART or ART on fetal immune system function.\nHEU children exhibit altered lymphocyte function and blunted responses of monocytes to pathogens. However,\nlittle is known about the effects of HIV/ART and ART exposure on lymphoid and myeloid cell activation during\nfetal development. Therefore, we will study the effects of SIV/ART or ART on both the innate and adaptive arms\nof the fetal immune system in circulation and in fetal tissues using a combination of flow cytometry, functional\nassays, and single-cell transcriptomics. Aim 2. Determine the effects of maternal SIV/ART or ART on fetal\nhematopoiesis. SIV/ART or ART may impact fetal immune system development by altering fetal hematopoietic\nstem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Therefore, in this aim, we will isolate HSPCs from the fetal liver and fetal\nbones and determine the transcriptional landscape and functional reconstitution abilities of HSPCs from\nSIV/ART, ART alone, and control fetuses. Given the increasingly prevalent use of ART in women of reproductive\nage, this study will further our understanding of the effect of ART on fetal immune development. The ultimate\ngoal of the proposed studies is to identify fetal immune system developmental pathways that can be targeted by\ntherapeutics and interventions to improve immune outcomes for this vulnerable population of infants.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nKaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a prevalent virus that establishes a lifelong persistent\ninfection in humans and is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and primary effusion lymphomas (PELs).\nDespite the reduction in complications associated with HIV infection due to combination antiretroviral\ntherapy, KS still occurs in individuals with well-controlled HIV infection, in older men without HIV infection\n(classic KS), in sub-Saharan Africa (endemic KS), and in transplant recipients (iatrogenic KS). Despite\nbeing a pressing human health problem, very little research has been conducted to date on potential\nvaccine development against KSHV infection and its associated diseases. This is primarily due to the lack\nof significant interest as well as the absence of an effective animal model that supports in vivo studies on\nKSHV infection. For this reason, recombinant Murine Herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) has been used as the\nmurine counterpart of KSHV in a small, manageable mouse model. The goal of this U01 application is\ntwofold: firstly, to test three different novel vaccine platforms against KSHV infection, and secondly, to\ndevelop chimeric MHV68 carrying the replacement of KSHV glycoprotein (MHV68-K-G) as a surrogate\nchallenge virus for testing the efficacy of KSHV vaccines in an in vivo mouse model.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nFundamental aging processes appear to be root-cause contributors to most of the disorders and diseases across\nthe lifespan that account for the bulk of disability, mortality, and health costs. The goal of the nation-wide\nTranslational Geroscience Network (TGN) is to accelerate translation of geroscience-guided lifestyle, nutritional,\nand drug interventions that target these aging processes from biological discovery and pre-clinical validation to\ntesting in humans. The TGN is motivated by the hypothesis that clinical interventions targeting fundamental\nmechanisms of aging can delay, prevent, alleviate, or treat age-related diseases and disabilities as a group,\ninstead of one at a time (the Geroscience Hypothesis). During the next grant period, the aims of TGN are:\nAim 1) Accelerate development of a diverse portfolio of interventions targeting fundamental aging processes\n(gerotherapeutic interventions) by leveraging TGN expertise and infrastructure in terms of study design, outcome\nmeasures selection, quality control, regulatory compliance, biostatistics, data management, gerodiagnostic\nassays, and biobanking for translational early phase gerotherapeutic clinical studies. The current 81 endorsed\nor planned studies linked to the TGN now include lifestyle and nutritional interventions, metformin, rapalogs, anti-\ninflammatories, MitoQ, senolytics, &/or NAD precursors for several indications as well as observational studies.\nAim 2) Discover, develop, select, optimize, and validate gerodiagnostic measures of aging mechanisms across\nstudies and optimize reference analytical capabilities of the Facilities for Geroscience\nAnalysis (FGA). The >150 gerodiagnostics and indicators of organ & immune dysfunction that are or will be\ntested in response to interventions include analytes in blood, urine, saliva, synovial fluid, buccal swabs, CSF,\nbiopsies, & other samples from TGN clinical studies.\nAim 3) Provide statistical and data management support to select efficient designs, facilitate sample size\nestimates, and incorporate FDA-compliant network-wide data capture, allowing cross-study comparisons.\nSensitive, specific, and reliable phenotypic signatures responsive to interventions that are based on body fluid\nanalytes, questionnaires, exam findings, physical & cognitive function, imaging, and biopsies will be refined and\ncomposite scores/ signatures integrating these analytes, clinical scales, and physical function tests developed.\nAim 4) Expand TGN biobanking of samples from across studies to facilitate reverse translation, exploratory\nanalyses, and new ancillary research as hypotheses develop and assays become available. We will continue to\nwork with the NIA Biobank to ensure sample storage and distribution, even beyond the terms of this award.\nBlood (plasma, serum, PBMCs), urine, buccal swabs (& as available, CSF, saliva, biopsies, aqueous humor,\nsynovial fluid, hair & nail clippings, microbiome), ECG, imaging, medical record (diagnoses, history, physical\nsigns, routine labs), and questionnaires from TGN/FGA minimally invasive & interventional studies are archived.\nThe TGN has enormous potential to impact public health through delaying, preventing, alleviating, and treating\nmultiple disorders and promoting healthspan, the period of life free of disability.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\n One of the most recent and significant public health problems deals with addressing vaccine hesitancy and\nmis/disinformation. As new types of vaccines become effective and available, and bundled together, it\nbecomes increasingly important that researchers and health departments learn how to best communicate to\nthe public the correct science behind vaccines. Black/African American and Latinx populations might be\nespecially impacted by misinformation due to health inequity and low health literacy.\n However, despite extensive exposure to vaccine mis- and disinformation, many Blacks and Latinx are\nresilient to misinformation and still choose to get vaccinated. This application takes a unique approach in\nleveraging that positive outcome by identifying the predictors of Black and Latinx individuals who are frequently\nexposed to misinformation, yet demonstrate broad vaccine acceptance for different vaccine types.\n Many factors play a role in vaccine acceptance/hesitancy, including social media and social networks, as\nwell as traditional multi-level factors such as mental health, political ideology, stigma, access to health\nservices, trust in the healthcare system, and educational opportunities. Our team has conducted extensive\nresearch on the factors influencing attitudes and behaviors among Black and Latinx populations, for COVID-19\nvaccine uptake, as well as ways to use digital data and tools to gain insights and intervene to improve them. In\nthis study, we seek to use similar artificial intelligence methods on social media, social network, and other\nmulti-level data to identify factors influencing vaccine acceptance among Black and Latinx populations.\n We seek to enroll 500 Black and Latinx individuals who are Twitter (X) followers of known vaccine-hesitant\ninfluencers. We will collect baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up data on participants\u2019 vaccine acceptance;\nmisinformation exposure; perceptions about vaccines, including willingness to receive future vaccines or enroll\nin a vaccine clinical trial; digital contextual data (e.g., social media content; social network ties; and other multi-\nlevel factors associated with vaccine knowledge and acceptance (e.g., political ideology, medical distrust,\nstructural factors). We will study the factors affecting acceptance of vaccines. We will also develop a tool to\nvisualize the data to inform researchers about how to add these new data/approaches to surveillance efforts.\nSpecifically, we seek to 1) Identify the relationship between social media data and vaccine acceptance among\nBlack and Latinx followers of influencers spreading vaccine-hesitant information, 2) Examine the influence of\nsocial network factors on vaccine acceptance, and 3) Develop a visualization tool to graph and map contextual\ndata (e.g., social media content and geographic and network location of social network ties).",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nCervical cancer is the fourth most common and third most fatal cancer among women worldwide. Cervical cancer\nis an AIDS-defining illness and the most common cancer among women living with HIV (WLWH) globally.\nOverall, WLWH have a higher risk of HPV acquisition, lower risk of HPV clearance, higher incidence of high\ngrade lesions (HGSIL), reduced regression from HGSIL to normal, and higher incidence of cervical cancer\ncompared to women without HIV. However, little is known about the biological mechanism of cervical pre-cancer.\nIt is estimated that there are 250,000-1 million new cases of cervical pre-cancer each year in the U.S. requiring\ntreatment for these pre-cancerous lesions. Even with the WHO\u2019s 90-70-90 cervical cancer elimination strategy,\nwhere they expect to treat 90% of the pre-cancer women, the unwanted effects of invasive treatment should not\nbe overlooked. Not all pre-cancers progress to cancer and identifying biomarkers associated with progression\ncould help with treatment algorithms (specifically in HIV). One compelling hypothesis is that additional molecular\nevents besides human papillomavirus (HPV) are required for cervical pre-cancer development as well as\nprogression to high grade lesions and biological aging is a likely event at the molecular level. Several studies\nsuggest that HIV induces alterations of the host biology and in doing so these alterations can accelerate\nbiological aging. HIV-related aging potentially results in impairing the immune system so that it can no longer\ncontrol the risk for cancer. Immune cell profiles using methylation-derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR) and\nleukocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) have been shown to be associated with risk of different cancers, including\nHPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer; however, there are no reports of studies in pre-cancer, which is a pre-cursor\nto cancers that will have impactful prevention strategies. In the proposed study, we will examine the association\nof two biomarkers of aging (aging-related inflammation and DNA methylation) with cervical pre-cancer in WLWH\nand compare with HIV-negative women in two races (Black and White). To achieve the goal, we will utilize tissues\nfrom: a) \u201ccoexisting\u201d normal and pre-cancer lesions from each individual and b) pre-cancer progression lesion\nsamples collected longitudinally from the same individual from two different time-points. This design allows\nvalidation of results using two different study designs. We will focus on the different neoplastic tissues and utilize\ncell isolation techniques and nucleotide processing technologies that allow comprehensive methylation assays\nto derive two biomarkers of aging, immune-cell profile (Aim 1) and biological age (Aim 2), using state-of-the-art\ncomputational algorithms. This innovative study will bridge the gap in translating molecular knowledge of cervical\npre-cancer progression and potentially provide insights into development of aging biomarkers. There is potential\ndemethylation mechanism that will significantly advance management and treatment of cervical pre-cancer\nlesions as well as therapeutic vaccine development, specifically in vulnerable populations (HIV status and race).",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nOral HPV is the cause of increasing incidence of HPV-related oropharynx cancer (HPV-OPC) in the\nUnited States and globally, and is expected to continue into the next century despite an effective\nvaccine. The risk of HPV-OPC and HPV-related anogenital malignancies is significantly increased\namong people living with HIV (PLWH). Oral and plasma HPV and E6 antibodies are associated with\nincreased future risk of HPV-OPC and present an opportunity for screening for HPV-OPC. We have\ndeveloped the longest running and largest cohort of healthy people living with and without HIV, with\nbiomarkers of HPV-OPC. This study will combine our existing unique enriched cohort of individuals\nwith HPV16 biomarkers with new participants identified in a screening scenario to develop a larger\ncohort of individuals at-risk for HPV16-OPC (called the MOUTH2 study). We will screen for oral and\nblood biomarkers with the aim to 1) study progression to HPV-OPC and how it differs in those with\nand without HIV; 2) characterize impact of HIV on oral HPV16 persistence, and 3) evaluate\nperformance characteristics of stand-alone vs sequential biomarker screening. This prospective\nobservational cohort will provide the ability to examine questions necessary to understand the long-\nterm natural history of oral HPV in people living with and without HPV and to inform future study\ndesign to elucidate the benefits and harms of screening.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract\nThe COVID-19 pandemic represents the 3rd outbreak caused by zoonotic transmission of a beta-coronavirus\n(beta-CoV) in the last 20 years. Hence there is an urgent need for new vaccine strategies to control the ongoing\npandemic and prevent future CoV outbreaks. mRNA vaccines have emerged as an ideal platform for the\ndevelopment of rapid-response vaccines, but clinical studies have shown that neutralizing antibody titers elicited\nby mRNA vaccines are ~10-fold lower than titers elicited by protein nanoparticle (NP) vaccines. This is a concern\nwith regards to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) that are less sensitive to vaccine-\ninduced antibodies. In addition, less than 25% of the world population is fully vaccinated. Thus, rapid-response\nvaccine technologies are needed that elicit potent antibody responses with a single injection and/or lower doses,\nto ensure lasting protection against VOCs, reduce costs, and accelerate global distribution. Moreover, prevention\nof future CoV pandemics requires the development of a universal CoV vaccine that elicits cross-reactive immune\nresponses against a broad spectrum of CoV strains by focusing responses to conserved epitopes. The scope of\nthe proposed research is to design and evaluate new vaccine strategies to enhance the potency of mRNA-based\nrapid-response vaccines and facilitate universal CoV vaccine development. The proposal is based on the EBR\nNP technology, which modifies membrane proteins such as CoV spike (S) proteins to self-assemble into virus-\nresembling NPs that bud from the cell surface. NP assembly is induced by inserting a short amino acid sequence\ninto the cytoplasmic tail designed to recruit proteins from the endosomal sorting complex required for transport\n(ESCRT) pathway. Initial studies in mice showed that low-dose injections of EBR NPs presenting the SARS-\nCoV-2 S protein elicited 10-fold higher neutralizing antibody titers than soluble S protein and protein-based NPs\nthat displayed the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. The EBR NP technology will be applied to\naccomplish three goals: i) Design a hybrid mRNA vaccine encoding the modified SARS-CoV-2 S-EBR construct\nthat would be expressed at the cell surface and self-assemble into virus-resembling NPs to elicit more potent\nantibody responses than the approved Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, while retaining the manufacturing properties\nand T-cell activation of mRNA vaccines. ii) Engineer S-EBR NPs to package and deliver S or S-EBR mRNA\nvaccines as an alternative to lipid NPs. This delivery approach would enhance mRNA vaccine potency as S\nproteins presented on S-EBR NPs induce potent antibody responses, facilitate efficient intracellular delivery, and\ntarget mRNA vaccines to tissues that are naturally infected by SARS-CoV-2 to induce local immune responses.\niii) Design and evaluate mosaic S-EBR NP-based universal CoV vaccine candidates that present full-length\nmembrane-associated S proteins from multiple CoV strains to elicit cross-reactive immune responses against a\nbroad spectrum of CoVs and protect against future outbreaks. The proposed vaccine strategies could have direct\nimpact on the COVID-19 global health crisis and advance our emergency preparedness for the next pandemic.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT ABSTRACT\nInfants born to HIV-infected mothers are at high risk for HIV acquisition. Additionally, HIV-exposed yet\nuninfected infants display reduced vaccine responses and increased disease susceptibility compared to\nunexposed infants. The development of certain T cell subsets, both in the mucosa and systemically, is\ndetermined by the presence of specific microbes in the gut and may be important in determining adaptive\nimmunity. However, the gut microbiota of HIV-exposed uninfected (iHEU) infants differs from that of HIV-\nunexposed (iHU) infants, since their mothers have altered gut microbiota. The gut virome also plays a central\nrole in modulating both the bacterial microbiota and immune response of adults, yet the association between\nthe infant enteric virome and cellular responses to vaccination has not yet been explored. This study proposes\nthat the enteric virome is one of the factors influencing the morbidity of HIV-exposed infants, either by directly\naltering mucosal immunity or by altering the composition of enteric bacterial communities, as a consequence of\nbacteriophage or other viral dynamics. This proposal will utilize an already funded, ongoing cohort to\nlongitudinally identify interactions between viruses, bacterial microbiota, and cellular responses to vaccination\nin 40 iHEU and 40 iHU (Aim 1). Viral metagenome data will be integrated with bacterial community datasets\nand T cell cytokine responses to BCG vaccination to identify viral and bacterial taxa correlated with BCG\nresponses. The effect of the expanded virome on bacterial microbiota and responses to BCG vaccination will\nthen be assessed for causality in gnotobiotic mouse models (Aim 2). The effect of the expanded iHEU viroem\non mucosa and peripheral gene expression will be assayed using single cell RNA sequencing in Aim 3.\nIntegrative analyses will be used to identify interactions between specific bacterial and viral taxa, as well as\ntheir associated with BCG responses. Together, these Aims will identify mechanisms of gut dysbiosis in iHEU\nand reveal potential therapeutics to restore health to this group. Collectively, this proposal will reveal how\nmaternal HIV infection shapes the enteric microbiome and immunity of associated infants.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nGenital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections\nworldwide. The infection is lifelong: there currently is no cure and no vaccine. In addition, HSV-1 and -2,\nhuman papillomavirus (HPV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are responsible for intersecting\nepidemics, where the disease caused by one virus facilitates the transmission and/or pathogenesis of the\nother. Numerous studies suggest that user-controlled multipurpose products providing HSV prevention \u2013ideally\nalong with HPV and HIV\u2013 in combination with contraception would strongly motivate higher uptake relative to\nsingle-purpose products: women not self-identifying as at risk of HSV infection would use a multipurpose\nproduct to avoid pregnancy, resulting in significantly improved user compliance, and hence effectiveness,\nrelative to single-purpose antiviral products. Many women would prefer a topical (vaginal) nonhormonal\ncontraception method that, unlike vaginal gels, does not require use immediately before or after sex. Our\napplication integrates key innovations in developing a next generation multipurpose technology (MPT)\nintravaginal ring (IVR) comprised of: (1) antiviral peptide lead candidate with activity against HSV, HPV, and\nHIV; (2) small-molecule inhibitors of sperm functions required to reach and fertilize the oocyte; and (3) a novel\nIVR platform for long-acting, controlled delivery of the two-drug combination. We have designed and\nsynthesized a library of small antiviral peptides that disrupt a range of viruses, including HSV, HPV, and HIV, at\nlow \u00b5M concentrations. An existing lead candidate, optimized for vaginal delivery, has been selected for IVR\nformulation under the current application. In parallel, we have designed and synthesized a library of highly\npotent, small-molecule inhibitors of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) that effectively block sperm motility and\nprevent in vitro fertilization at sub nM concentrations. Finally, our team developed an innovative IVR platform\nfor the delivery of drug combinations, including small molecules and biomolecules, at independently controlled\nrates. In Aim 1, we will evaluate our panel of sAC inhibitor late-lead candidates using biochemical, functional,\nand pharmacological assays to select a lead candidate designed specifically for vaginal dosing. In Aim 2, we\nwill formulate and evaluate in vitro human-sized MPT IVRs to deliver our lead antiviral peptide and lead\ncontraceptive combinations at target in vitro rates. In Aim 3, we will assess the pharmacokinetics and\npharmacodynamics (safety and anti-HSV efficacy) of MPT IVR candidates in mice (efficacy and preliminary\nsafety) and sheep (pharmacokinetics and safety). This project builds on an established collaboration of\ninvestigators and will advance our scientific knowledge on vaginal delivery of novel agents in the context of\nHSV prevention and nonhormonal contraception.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT/SUMMARY\nThe human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is a WHO-endorsed, evidence-based tool that can prevent up to\n90% of cervical cancer cases by preventing HPV infection when administered prior to exposure to HPV and it\nis recommended for girls ages 9-14. However, HPV vaccine coverage is low in low- and middle- income\ncountries (LMICS) where risk of dying from cervical cancer is high, especially in Zambia (site of parent grant;\nUO1CA275033). REACH aims to increase access to and uptake of the vaccine using implementation science\nmethods. However, implementation science is a field developed in the U.S. and only recently has started to\nrecognize the importance of explicitly recognizing equity in the implementation process. Transposing\napproaches from high income countries risks failure when misunderstanding contexts, relying on leadership\nand expertise from HICs, and maintaining colonization practices This supplement project, responding to the\ncall for Administrative Supplements for NCI Global Oncology Mentored Research (NOT-CA-24-028), is a\nmethods study aiming to explicitly investigate how equity and decolonization practices can be embedded in\ncapacity building practices and implementation process. This is a methods-focused study aiming to strengthen\nDr. Asante's knowledge and skills on implementation science with a focus on team collaboration. To achieve\nthese goals, we will adapt an evidence-based matrix mentoring model for global collaboration, including self,\nsenior, scientific, staff mentors and sponsors. We conceptualize equity as a process aimed at reducing\ndisparities and its root causes, including social, structural, and political determinants. Centering equity in\nimplementation entails building trusting relationships, dismantling power structures, and investing in strategies\nthat advance equity. We will use methods of reflexivity based on Alexander et al's. model to enhance personal\nand team awareness of their own positionality. The model proposes that three reflexivity practices (reflexivity\nin, on, and underlying action) are tied to five actions from the Ottawa Charter: a) building healthy public policy,\n(b) creating supportive environments, (c) strengthening community actions, (d) developing personal skills, and\n(e) reorienting health services. Based on this model, Dr. Asante will: (1) Center equity in the REACH team\nusing Alexanders' three types of reflexivity, and (2) Center equity in the development of the\nimplementation strategies. The project will produce a needed outline of methods for the field of\nimplementation science on how to explicitly outline reflexivity and center equity during the implementation\nmapping process. This supplement will also strengthen Dr. Asante's skills in global research leadership as an\nimplementation scientist, supporting her to reach her mid-term goal to MPI an R01 in implementing color\ncancer screening in Zambia, further enabling her to reach her long-term goal of launching her own independent\nresearch in CRC prevention.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nWe recently reported that SCCA incidence (particularly advanced-stage disease) and mortality rates are\nincreasing rapidly (>3% per year) in the US with notable (>5%/year) increases in women 50 years and older\nshowing that SCCA is one of the fastest accelerating causes of cancer incidence and mortality among all\ncancer sites. Women with lower genital tract (cervical/vaginal/vulvar) dysplasia or cancer (WLGTN) represent a\nlarge population (>200,000 new cases per year) at elevated risk of developing SCCA. We and others have\nshown that the incidence of SCCA among WLGTN aged 50 years and older is over 20 per 100,000 persons,\nwhich is both comparable to the incidence rate among women with HIV (who are the focus of current screening\nefforts) and is similar to the cervical cancer incidence prior to widespread screening. Furthermore, HPV\nvaccination is unlikely to decrease SCCA incidence in this population both because WLGTN have already\nbeen exposed to oncogenic HPV, and vaccine rates remain low among US women. This highlights an urgent\nneed for studies evaluating possible targeted prevention in the form of anal cancer screening. Our goal is to\nevaluate the benefits and harms of SCCA screening among WLGTN. Screening for SCCA involves the\nidentification of precancerous anal lesions (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or \"aHSILs\") using\ncytologic testing or HPV testing (potentially performed by patients themselves). These lesions (if histologically\nconfirmed) can then be treated, thereby preventing carcinoma development, similar to practices widely\nendorsed for cervical cancer. To inform guidelines, data regarding screening characteristics, natural history,\npatient acceptability, the benefits and harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening for SCCA among WLGTN,\nare urgently needed. We therefore propose a two-site, two-year longitudinal study of 350 HIV uninfected\nWGLTN aged \u226545 years. The results of this longitudinal study will be used to synthesize a mathematical\n(simulation) model that will estimate clinical and population-level benefits versus harms and cost-effectiveness\nassociated with different screening approaches. The Specific Aims are: (1A) To evaluate the respective\nscreening test characteristics of anal cytology, clinician-collected and self-collected high-risk HPV (hrHPV)\ntesting, and cytology/hrHPV cotesting compared to the gold standard of high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) exam\nwith biopsy; (1B): To determine baseline anal hrHPV and histologic aHSIL (haHSIL) prevalence and\nlongitudinal risk among WLGTN; (2): To compare patient acceptability and experiences for anal cancer\nscreening strategies among WLGTN; and (3): To develop a mathematical model determining the potential\nmortality and morbidity benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of anal dysplasia screening and/or hrHPV\ntesting in WLGTN. In summary, the proposed multidisciplinary study will generate much-needed data regarding\nthe optimal SCCA screening approach for WLGTN, necessary to inform national screening recommendations\nfor WLGTN. This study will have direct implications for clinical cancer prevention practices.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nThe early life microbiome plays a significant role in health and disease, including immune development and\nmaturation. Maternal microbiota is a major determinant of infant microbiota. Studies investigating maternal-\ninfant microbiota transmission and its consequent influence on infant immunity have focused on the bacterial\ncomponent. Yet the impact of maternal virome on infant virome is largely unknown, and studies of the virome\nin early life are limited. Infants born to mothers living with HIV are more vulnerable to diseases, have stunted\ngrowth, and have altered immunity, including immune activation, even when they are not infected with HIV\nthemselves. Much work has gone into understanding the reasons for this phenomenon. Given that the enteric\nvirome is expanded in HIV infection, it is not surprising that our preliminary data show that infants born to HIV-\ninfected mothers inherit a wider range of viruses than unexposed infants. Thus, similarly to the bacterial\nmicrobiome, the gut virome could also play an important role in modulating immune responsiveness and\ngrowth of infants. We hypothesize that the infant enteric virome is vertically transferred, and the expanded\nenteric virome of infants born to mothers who are HIV-infected leads to accelerated immune ontogeny and\nactivation, which influences the morbidity of infants exposed to HIV. We propose to:\n1: Determine the influence of maternal virome on the infant enteric virome and compare the virome succession\nin infants exposed and unexposed to HIV through the first 9 months of life. The viromes of matched mother-\ninfant pairs will be determined via metagenomic sequencing of nucleic acid isolated from purified viral particles.\nMaternal fecal and vaginal virome composition will be correlated with that of the infants\u2019 gut in the first week\npostpartum. The composition of the enteric virome will be compared between infants exposed and unexposed\nto HIV during the first week, 4, 15 and 36 weeks of life.\n2: Evaluate the relationship between the virome and the bacterial microbiota in infant stool. We will assess the\nrelationship between bacteriophage and their bacterial targets longitudinally.\n3: Evaluate the relationship between the infant enteric virome and intestinal inflammation, immune ontogeny\nand linear growth. To test the hypothesis that the expanded enteric virome in uninfected infants exposed to\nHIV contributes to greater immune diversity in early life, we will longitudinally assess circulating NK and T cell\nontogeny using CyTOF analysis over the first 9 months of life. To test whether the virome causes altered\nimmune ontogeny, we will feed infant mice with phages with and without their bacterial hosts and evaluate the\neffect on immunity.\nUnderstanding the factors that shape the infant gut virome and its consequent impact on bacterial microbiota,\nimmune ontogeny and linear growth could facilitate the development of interventions to reduce infant morbidity\nand mortality, particularly for those who are exposed to HIV.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nCervical cancer is a highly preventable malignancy caused by high-risk human papillomavirus\n(hrHPV) but is not fully prevented, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).\nWomen living with HIV (WWH) have higher rates of hrHPV infection and 6-fold higher rates of\ninvasive cervical cancer. Sub-Saharan Africa carries the highest burden of cervical cancer\nglobally, as well as the highest global burden of HIV. The Einstein/Rwanda Research and\nCapacity Building Program (ER-RCBP) has been conducting research in cervical cancer\nprevention for Rwandan WWH since 2005, conducting community- and clinic-based research in\nscreening uptake, screening modalities, assessing HPV vaccine effectiveness, evaluating how\nto implement innovative screening approaches, and developing pathology and molecular\nlaboratory capacity. We have enrolled nearly 10,000 women WWH and 3,000 HIV-negative\nwomen in studies of cervical HPV infection and disease. ER-RCBP\u2019s primary partner in this\napplication, and in prior research in HIV services and cervical cancer prevention, is the Rwanda\nBiomedical Center (RBC), the implementation arm of Rwanda\u2019s Ministry of Health for healthcare\ndelivery and research. Rwanda has an extremely effective HIV healthcare program, an equally\neffective program for HPV vaccination of girls, and has recently launched a cervical cancer\nscreening and prevention program with primary HPV testing followed by visual inspection of the\ncervix and immediate treatment with thermal ablation, if indicated, for screen-positive women.\nRwanda is thus an ideal location for testing strategies for effective cervical cancer screening in a\nlow-income country with a high burden of HIV, cervical cancer, and a large unscreened\npopulation. We propose here a clinical trials site in Rwanda as part of the CASCADE Clinical\nTrials Network for Cervical Cancer Prevention. Lessons learned in Rwanda can be generalized\nto many low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nOropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is predominantly caused by HPV 16 and other oncogenic HPV types and\ndisproportionately impacts men and people living with HIV (PLWH). There is no reliable method to detect OPC\npre-cancerous lesions for secondary prevention. Trials assessing efficacy of the 9vHPV vaccine to prevent OPC\nare ongoing by our team: NCI-funded U54 grant, Research on Oral and Cervical Cancer, HPV and HIV in the\nAmericas [ROCCHHA] Trial 201 among men with HIV, and the Merck v503-049 trial among HIV-uninfected\nmen. While HPV vaccination is a promising approach for the primary prevention of OPC, vaccination may not be\navailable to those in greatest need as most countries exclude males in their national programs and may not have\npolicies for PLWH vaccination. Additional methods to prevent OPC and identify PLWH at highest risk for\nsurveillance are urgently needed, particularly given that OPC incidence rates are significantly increasing in the\nUS and Latin America. To inform prevention strategies, the identification of modifiable risk factors and easily\nmeasured biomarkers identifying those at highest risk is needed. Development of HPV-related OPC is multi-\nfactorial. Sexual behavior leading to an oral oncogenic HPV infection is a necessary step. Regardless of\nanatomic site of infection, only a proportion of infections persist and progress to cancer. Multiple interplaying\nfactors influence viral persistence. We are among the few groups that have conducted large oral HPV natural\nhistory studies contributing to this literature. Results from ours and other studies indicate that older age, poor\noral health, immune dysregulation, such as occurs among PLWH, and aberrant DNA methylation influence oral\nHPV persistence. Exacerbating this is the fact that PLWH are living to older ages which results in lifelong immune\ndysfunction that may accelerate biological aging, increase risk of acquiring or reactivating a multitude of\ninfections such as EBV, and ultimately lead to reduced oncogenic viral control. Social factors compound this\nscenario as PLWH have lower utilization of dental care and other services resulting in prolonged untreated oral\ninfections, subsequent chronic oral inflammation, periodontal disease, and tooth loss, factors that potentially\npromote oral HPV carcinogenesis, and have independently been associated with HPV-OPC risk. We are\nconducting two large studies as part of our ROCCHHA grant among PLWH that obtain clinical data and oral\ngargle specimens at bi-annual study visits, which we will leverage to study oral HPV natural history. The goal of\nthis application is to define the natural history of oncogenic oral HPV infection among PLWH. The central\nhypothesis of the Oral HPV Research Among Latin Americans Living with HIV (ORAL H2) Study is that\namong PLWH advanced biological age, dental health, and viral factors are associated with persistent oral\noncogenic HPV. We will estimate oral HPV 16 and oncogenic HPV infection, assess factors associated with viral\npersistence, and determine the optimal combination of biomarkers and behavioral factors that predict oral\noncogenic HPV persistence.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe program will strengthen patient-oriented HIV clinical investigation training of physician-scientists and\nother exceptional clinicians in Mwanza, in northwestern Tanzania. The program builds upon two decades of\ncollaboration and capacity building by the partner institutions. The primary research institution in Tanzania will\nbe the Mwanza Intervention Trials Unit (MITU), which is a unit of Tanzania's National Institute for Medical\nResearch (NIMR). MITU was established in 2006 as a collaboration between NIMR and the London School\nof Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) to strengthen HIV interventional research in Tanzania. MITU\ncollaborates closely with the Weill Bugando School of Medicine, which is also located in Mwanza. Weill\nBugando was established in 2003 to train physicians for northwestern Tanzania. MITU and Weill Bugando\nhave collaborated with Weill Cornell Medical College since their founding.\nThis research training program aims to fill a critical gap in Mwanza: the need for Tanzanian physicians with\nrigorous training in patient-oriented HIV clinical investigation. We use the NIH definition of clinical\ninvestigation as research which directly interacts with individual patients or clusters of patients in Phase I, II, or\nIII clinical trials, pragmatic trials, or formative epidemiologic or behavioral research in preparation for clinical\ntrials. The goals of the proposed training program are: 1.To increase the number of clinical investigators at\nMITU and thereby increase institutional capacity for HIV clinical investigation 2. Establish Weill Bugando/MITU\nas a sustainable training center for HIV clinical investigation. The ultimate goal is to prevent new HIV\ninfections, provide effective HIV care, and improve HIV outcomes in Tanzania and East Africa.\nWe will provide long-term training to fifteen outstanding clinician scientists to conduct patient-oriented HIV\nclinical investigation. We will primarily train physicians but will also train exceptional other clinicians (PharmD,\nDMD). We will train 10 PhDs, and 5 MS degree candidates. Tanzanian trainees will benefit from participation\nin 17 active research projects in five synergistic areas of HIV investigation including HIV prevention and\nvaccine research, implementation of HIV testing and treatment, women's health, HIV related co-infections, and\nHIV and cardiovascular disease. We will also strengthen the PhD program in clinical investigation at Weill\nBugando by introducing 4 new graduate courses in clinical investigation. Weill Cornell is committing\ninstitutional funds so that 4 of the best PhD graduates can have 2-year post-doctoral appointments as\nMITU research scientists after their Fogarty training. At the end of the 5-year training program, MITU will have\na cadre of clinical investigators and a greater depth and breadth of externally funded HIV patient-oriented\nresearch. MITU/Weill Bugando will be a training hub for HIV clinical investigators in East Africa.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nTwenty-five percent of children with HIV-infection have childhood wasting (low weight-for-height or low mid-upper\narm circumference, and HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) children are twice as likely to be underweight as\ncomparable HIV-unexposed children. Wasting is known to promote morbidity, HIV-progression, and mortality\namong these children. Improving wasting prevention and treatment for children and in early infant diagnosis and\nHIV-care programs could not only improve the child health outcomes of these children, but also substantially\nlower the global burden of childhood wasting.\nThis proposal will develop a novel two-way short message service (SMS) platform that targets key barriers to\nimproving nutritional care for HEU and HIV-infected children. This intervention will combine a maternally\nadministered malnutrition monitoring system (MAMMS) with infant and young child education (IYCF) delivered\nby SMS. After developing the intervention using participatory design methods, we will complete a proof-of-\nconcept quasi-experimental trial of MAMMS-IYCF in the R21. If the R21 milestones are meet, we will use the\nR33 to conduct a randomized trial testing the effectiveness of MAMMS-IYCF at reduced the incidence wasting,\nand the duration of wasting treatment. During this trial we will also assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of\nMAMMS-IYCF, and to better understand which barriers are being successfully addressed by intervention we will\nmeasure its effect on key attitudinal and behavioral outcomes including trust in the healthcare system, intention\nto seek if a child becomes wasted, and IYCF knowledge. This trial will generate the evidence necessary to\nintegrate MAMMS-IYCF interventions into existing HIV-mHealth programs across the globe, and improve the\noutcomes of children in early infant diagnosis and HIV-care services while also substantially lowering the global\nburden of childhood wasting.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nThere remains an acute, critical need to study HIV/AIDS as approximately 32,000 individuals are infected\nannually in the U.S. and mortality globally remains at over 630,000 annually. The NIH Office of AIDS has four\nmain priority areas for HIV/AIDS research: reduce the incidence, develop HIV cures, develop next generation\ntherapies and address HIV comorbidities. The National Primate Research Centers are charged with supporting\nthe national needs for nonhuman primate research, with a significant priority on supporting HIV/AIDS related\nresearch. The Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNRPC) actively supports research projects in\neach of the priority areas designated by the Office of AIDS research.\nThere remains a current shortage of Indian origin rhesus macaques in the U.S. due to a ban on exportation and\nrecent global pressures significantly exacerbating the supply. This has led to the increased demand for P51\nsupported animals to be used to supply HIV/AIDS projects. The SNPRC has been disproportionately affected by\nthe national macaque shortage due to the small size of our SPF rhesus colony and the assumption of a greater\nresponsibility for research using rhesus. The SNPRC resources serve not only a number of internal core\nscientists that are focused on infectious disease, but also a heavily external-facing research portfolio. The\nSNPRC supports > 230 active research requests from > 120 affiliated scientists, with >30 % of rhesus macaque\nprojects completed onsite associated with HIV/AIDS related research. These requests have increased the\ndemand for appropriate ABSL2 research holding space in order to support the upcoming HIV/AIDS related\nprojects.\nThis proposed P51 supplement will meet an urgent need to upgrade ABSL2 macaque holding space to support\nHIV/AIDS related research. Over the last decade several ABSL2 buildings and rooms have been removed from\nservice and taken offline at SNPRC due to failing HVAC systems. This supplement will provide HVAC upgrades\nto eight ABSL2 rooms to bring them back into service to support rhesus macaque holding at SNPRC.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThis is a proposal for a two-year career transition award to study atypical B cells as a novel immunologic and\nmetabolic target to improve vaccine responses in immunosuppressed individuals. The candidate is currently a\npostdoctoral research fellow at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The proposal builds on the\ncandidate's extensive experience in vaccine immunology and immunometabolism to understand how metabolic\nreprogramming of B cells contributes to successful vaccine responses. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted\nthe need to develop and rapidly deploy highly immunogenic vaccines. However, insufficient immune responses\nin immunocompromised individuals have emphasized that novel vaccine formulations may be required for\nspecific populations to overcome immunosuppression. To date, the basic immunology behind successful\nvaccine responses during immunosuppression has not been well characterized. By dissecting the immunologic\nand metabolic landscape following vaccination in immunosuppressed individuals, we hope to generate building\nblocks to reverse engineer vaccines for specific patient populations. Preliminary data from the principal\ninvestigator indicates that solid organ transplant recipients, who respond poorly to vaccination due to a variety\nof immunosuppressive drugs, manage to successfully respond to COVID-19 vaccination by expanding atypical\nB cells that are reliant on fatty acid oxidation. To further these findings, the principal investigator has proposed\na research plan consisting of 3 specific aims. Aim 1 will define populations of immunosuppressed individuals\nwho utilize atypical CD11c+ B cells as a salvage pathway to successful vaccine responses. Aim 2 will assess\natypical CD11c+ B cell and T cell interaction to determine specific immunological contexts that drive CD11c+ B\ncell expansion. Aim 3 will target fatty acid oxidation using vaccine adjuvants to enhance atypical CD11c+ B cell\ndevelopment. Together, these studies will answer how atypical B cells develop in the presence of\nimmunosuppression, what agents we can use to metabolically target them, and who will benefit from vaccine\nstrategies targeting atypical B cells. The principal investigator will also learn new techniques necessary to\naccomplish the proposed research under the advisory team (Drs. Cox, Bailey, Durbin, Ji, and Pearce), all of\nwhom have pioneering expertise in vaccinology, immunology, immunometabolism, and biostatistics. Importantly,\nher advisory committee collectively has a very strong track record of training both clinical and postdoctoral fellows\nwho have successfully transitioned into independent investigators at top tier research institutions. She will also\nengage in and present at national seminars, take coursework on metabolic modeling, clinical vaccinology, Jr.\nFaculty leadership program, grant-writing seminars, and training on running a laboratory. The outlined career\ndevelopment and research plan will provide the candidate with unique cross-disciplinary skills that will enable\nher transition to independence and identify promising strategies to improve vaccine responses in\nimmunocompromised individuals.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nCervical cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many sub-Saharan countries, including Nigeria.\nExpanding human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for young girls/women, ages 9-26 years (primary\nprevention) and HPV self-collection for cervical cancer screening for older women, ages 30-49 (secondary\nprevention) are both critical to achieving WHO and Nigerian goals for reducing the cervical cancer burden. The\nNigerian government now recommends HPV vaccination and self-collection, yet uptake is poor. As such,\ncontext-specific, targeted and culturally relevant implementation strategies are needed. We focus on HPV\nvaccination among girls and self-collection among women because of the substantial burden of cervical\ncancer. Mother-daughter relationships in Nigeria can be leveraged to increase HPV vaccination uptake among\nyoung girls and HPV self-collection among mothers. Mothers (or similar female caregivers) profoundly\ninfluence decisions and preferences about young girls\u2019 vaccine uptake in the Nigerian cultural context. At the\nsame time, maternal choices about HPV self-collection can be reinforced in discussions with their daughters. In\nthe proposed study, Actions for Collaborative Community-Engaged Strategies for HPV (ACCESS-HPV), we will\nuse participatory crowdsourcing methods to drive HPV prevention among mother-daughter dyads.\nCrowdsourcing open calls will allow us to identify locally relevant messages and dissemination techniques to\nincrease uptake of HPV prevention. Then, participatory learning communities will build capacity for community-\nled implementation of selected strategies. Informed by social learning theory and the PEN-3 cultural model, our\nmulti-disciplinary research team proposes the following specific aims: (1) to develop a new combined\ncampaign to increase HPV vaccination for young girls (ages 9-26) and HPV self-collection for mothers (ages\n30-49) using crowdsourcing open calls and participatory learning communities; (2) to determine the\neffectiveness of a final combined campaign on uptake of HPV vaccination among young girls/women and HPV\nself-collection among their mothers using a stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial; (3) to estimate the\nimpact and cost-effectiveness of the crowdsourced campaign. Our primary outcome will be vaccine uptake\n(ascertained by clinic records of vaccine uptake) among young girls and HPV self-collection (ascertained by\nlaboratory receipt of specimens) among their mothers. The strong support of the Nigerian Institute for Medical\nResearch (NIMR) alongside national HPV programs creates a rich research infrastructure and increases the\nlikelihood of successful implementation. Our multi-disciplinary research team has experience organizing\nimplementation research focused on crowdsourcing and community participation in Nigeria. This study will\nenhance our understanding of HPV prevention in resource-constrained settings.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nMore than 44,000 new cases of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) are reported globally each year, 84% of which occur in\nAfrica. This and other Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-induced malignancies predominate in\npeople with acquired or iatrogenic immunodeficiencies. Although KSHV can be detected in other human body\nfluids, its frequent detection in saliva in groups both with and without risk of sexually transmitted infections (e.g.,\nchildren) suggests that the oral cavity is the site of primary acquisition. However, the mechanism of KSHV oral\ntransmission in vivo, particularly the critical viral envelope glycoproteins (gps) required for viral entry,\nremains unresolved. Several KSHV\u2013host interactions have been identified, but all prior experiments were\nperformed in vitro and have not been validated in vivo due to prior lack of an appropriate animal model. Through\ncollaboration with the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, our laboratory has access to the common\nmarmoset (Callithrix jacchus, CJ), a recently developed KSHV non-human primate model that is susceptible to\nKSHV oral infection, and under immunosuppression acquires KS-like skin lesions. The objective of this\napplication is to elucidate the minimum gps required to initiate primary oral infection in vivo, as a prerequisite to\nselecting key gps for developing an effective prophylactic vaccine candidate. This application builds on Dr.\nOgembo\u2019s recently completed NCI K01 CA184388-05 research on KSHV entry mechanisms and vaccine\ndevelopment. Recently, we showed that in vitro, the KSHV glycoprotein gH/gL is essential for viral infection of\nepithelial, endothelial, and fibroblasts cells, but not B cells. Notably, we and others have also shown that both\nmonoclonal and polyclonal Abs to KSHV glycoproteins gB, gH/gL, and gpK8.1, can neutralize KSHV infection of\ndiverse permissive human cells in vitro. Building on this success, we generated KSHV deletion mutants lacking\nthe four glycoproteins thought to be critical for viral entry (gB, gH/gL, gpK8.1) and various monoclonal antibodies\nspecific to these gps. In this project, we will use human ex vivo samples and the CJ KSHV model to test the\nhypothesis that gB and gH/gL are critical for KSHV in vivo oral transmission. The premise of our proposal is\nbuilt on strong evidence that 1) KSHV can infect CJ, which develop KS-like skin lesions, and 2) Abs against the\nKSHV glycoproteins gB and gH/gL can neutralize KSHV infection in vitro and ex vivo. Furthermore, the\npermissiveness to KSHV infection of human cells ex vivo and CJ makes these platforms ideal to test the KSHV\ngp requirements for infection. Successful completion of the proposed study will elucidate the minimum KSHV\ngps required for primary infection in ex vivo and in vivo models, advancing our long-term goal of defining the\ninitial steps in KSHV infection of humans and the role of antibodies in protecting against the early steps of KSHV\ntransmission. This will ultimately inform design and development of prophylactic vaccines that can prevent KSHV\ninfection and its associated cancers.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nViral fusion proteins are fascinating protein folding machineries capable of adopting completely different\nconformations during the fusion process; they are also important vaccine and therapeutic targets. Previous\nstudies have revealed both pre- and post-fusion conformations of the soluble fragments of many viral fusion\nproteins, but less is known for structures of their fusion peptide, transmembrane (TM) and membrane-proximal\nregions in the context of lipid bilayers. We hypothesize that membrane-interacting regions of other fusion proteins\nrelated to HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) adopt defined oligomeric structures that are critical for the stability,\nfunction and antigenicity of the full-length proteins in membrane. We have previously determined the structures\nof the TM, membrane proximal external region, and cytoplasmic tail of HIV-1 Env in bicelles that mimic lipid\nbilayers using the latest NMR technology. We find that these regions all form well-ordered trimeric clusters and\nare conformationally coupled, and that disrupting them can reduce fusion and alter the antigenic structure of the\nentire Env. In the current project, we propose to apply our NMR/bicelle technology to investigate the membrane\nregions of SIV Env and the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), and to use cryo-electron microscopy to\ndetermine structures of the full-length proteins reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs. We will define roles in membrane\nfusion of critical structural elements of these regions by deep mutagenesis and functional assays. We will pursue\nthe following specific aims: 1) we will investigate the membrane-interacting components of SIV Env; 2) we will\ninvestigate the membrane-interacting components in the postfusion arrangement; 3) we will determine structures\nof the full-length SIV Env and SARS-CoV-2 S in the context of membrane; 4) we will elucidate roles of the\nmembrane-interacting domains of HIV/SIV Env and SARS-CoV-2 S in their stability, function and antigenicity.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nThis proposal requests funds to purchase a BD FACSymphony S6 flow cytometric sorter to be housed in an\nactive and established core, the Flow Cytometry Core at the California National Primate Research Center\n(CNPRC). The CNPRC is one of seven national designated primate research centers. Local, regional, and\nnational investigators pursue translational research at CNPRC that is relevant to immunology, infectious\ndisease, gene therapy and somatic cell genome editing, regenerative medicine and stem cell transplantation,\ncardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodevelopment. The instrument is requested to support >20 current\nNIH-funded research projects from 6 Major Users and 11 Minor Users, as well as pending and future NIH-\nfunded research, that spans basic, translational, and even clinical research. These projects include studies of\ntherapeutic HIV vaccines, SIV pathogenesis, genome editing, retinal gene therapy, tissue-targeted AAV\nvectors, and even a phase-1/2a human clinical trial of a next-generation COVID vaccine candidate, for which\nmechanistic immunologic analysis will be performed at UC Davis. All these studies and indeed much of\nmodern biomedicine requires the ability to separately study functions of specific cell types, or even individual\ncells. To perform such studies reproducibly and at an adequate quality level, furthermore, requires an\ninstrument that is consistently checked and maintained, and one that should be under service contract. The\nBD FACSymphony S6 flow cytometric sorter will serve the increasing number of samples of our Users that are\ncurrently stressing a >20-year-old FACSAria flow sorter. The FACSAria was purchased using institutional\nfunds and has been successfully maintained for an extraordinarily long serviceable lifetime, and was under\nservice contract continuously until BD no longer offered the contract. However, the age and wide use of the\nolder instrument impacts availability to the expanding NIH-funded research of our Major Users. Together,\nthese constraints are hampering the progress of NIH- funded projects in their laboratories as well as efforts of\ntheir collaborators. The FACSymphony S6, with its greater selection of channels matched to those in our\nanalytic cytometers, better robustness, more consistent maintenance, and higher laser power, will significantly\nadvance our Major and Minor Users\u2019 pursuits of novel mechanistic insights. We will integrate this instrument\ninto an existing CNPRC core facility, the Flow Cytometry Core, which is maintained by UC Davis and CNPRC\nwith significant infrastructure and oversight and advisory committees. The existing infrastructure will integrate\nthe operation, maintenance and management of the proposed instrument which will, in turn, stimulate new\nresearch projects and innovations for many years.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Pregnant women living with HIV (PWLHIV) are more likely to experience adverse birth outcomes, including\npreterm birth (PTB), than pregnant women not living with HIV (PWNLHIV), thereby substantially contributing to\nmaternal and infant morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Alterations in bacteria of the vagina\nvaginal have been linked to PTB but this cannot fully explain the increased risk. We found that although PWLHIV\nhad an increased vaginal bacterial diversity and higher prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated\nbacteria compared to PWNLHIV, HIV infection was independently associated with PTB. Therefore, other\nmechanisms must be in play. The role of vaginal viral communities, collectively referred to as \u201cvirome\u201d, has not\nbeen evaluated. Additionally, the mechanisms of HIV- versus ARV-induced PTB needs to be investigated so that\nintervention measures can be identified to mitigate these risks.\nThe enteric virome appears to be altered during HIV infection. Expansion of bacteriophages, viruses that infect\nbacteria, has been linked to immune cell expansion and increased inflammation in the gut and gut bacterial\ndiversity is mirrored in the virome. In non-pregnant WLHIV, viruses from four major viral families were found in\nthe upper female genital tract, but no comparison to PWNLHIV was made and the presence of bacteriophages\nwas not evaluated. A higher prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV), especially of high-risk types, has been\nfound in WLHIV compared to WNLHIV. However, to date, limited data exist on the effect of HIV on the collective\nvaginal viral community, which is likely to be altered. Likewise, few studies have investigated the relationship\nbetween the vaginal virome and PTB. Here we hypothesise that HIV infection leads to an expanded vaginal\nvirome, including increased number and diversity of bacteriophages, which either directly or indirectly (through\nalteration of the bacterial microbiota) is associated with a higher PTB risk in PWLHIV. As part of this proposed\nproject, we will leverage the infrastructure and samples, as well as rigorous and extensive data of two ongoing\ncohorts of pregnant women in Cape Town, South Africa to address this hypothesis with the following Specific\nAims:\nAim 1: To assess the effect of HIV, pregnancy and antiretroviral drugs on vaginal virome diversity and\ncomposition. Hypothesis 1: PWLHIV have an expanded vaginal virome compared to PWNLHIV\nAim 2: To evaluate vaginal bacteriophage-host interactions in PWLHIV. Hypothesis 2: Viral communities\nalter the bacterial component of the vagina through predator-prey dynamics\nAim 3: To compare vaginal virome diversity and composition in women experiencing PTB versus age-\nand parity-matched women with normal birth outcomes. Hypothesis 3: Expansion of the vaginal virome is\nresponsible for increased rates of PTB.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Evaluating the Epidemiology and Determinants of Neurologic Post-acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 42 million\nindividuals in the United States and long-term complications are frequently reported, referred to as post-acute\nsequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). Even among survivors with mild acute illness, neurologic symptoms such\nas chronic fatigue, dysautonomia, and cognitive impairment are frequently reported. To date, the etiology and\npathophysiology of neurologic PASC remain unclear; however, underlying autoantibodies and immune\nactivation are suspected. In our prospective COVID-19 ID Persistence Cohort (C-PIC), more than half of\nCOVID-19 survivors are reporting neurologic PASC at one year. We have identified an association between\nneurologic PASC with both SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and ANA. Specifically, nucleocapsid (NP)\nantibody levels are elevated compared to spike trimer (ST) antibody levels in participants with neurologic\nPASC. Furthermore, our preliminary data has identified a potential signal linking neurologic PASC and\ndecreased gastrointestinal microbiota diversity. In this mentored career project, we hypothesize that\nautoimmunity, immune activation, and microbiome dysbiosis are associated with neurologic PASC. Candidate:\nAs an Infectious Diseases physician with a master\u2019s in public health and applied epidemiology and outbreak\ntraining through the Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Epidemic Intelligence Service, I am uniquely\npositioned to study the epidemiology and determinants for neurologic PASC. My experience studying post-\nEbola syndrome in Liberia provided me with the foresight to contribute viral persistence and sequelae aims to\nthe C-PIC study, which includes longitudinal PASC survey data and biorepository specimens. Through the\nguidance of my outstanding multidisciplinary team of mentors, I plan to fulfill my training objectives of (1)\ndeveloping expertise in advanced biostatistical analysis of survey data and (2) bridging translational research\nand descriptive cohort data. Environment: My team of mentors at Columbia University Irving Medical Center\n(CUIMC) are experts in epidemiology, biostatistics, immunology, and microbiome analysis. CUIMC also has a\nlong track record of enabling young physician-scientists to develop independent and successful careers in\nacademic medicine. Approach: We hypothesize that chronic fatigue, dysautonomia, and cognitive impairment\nsub-phenotypes of neurologic PASC have different underlying pathophysiology, including autoimmunity,\nimmune activation, and microbiome dysbiosis. In Aim 1, we will characterize neurologic PASC epidemiology,\ntrajectory, and sub-phenotypes using longitudinal neurologic PASC surveys. In Aim 2, we will identify\nassociations between neurologic PASC with SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and autoantibodies. In Aim 3, we\nwill identify associations between neurologic PASC and immune activation and explore the role of gut\nmicrobiota. This proposal provides an innovative approach to studying determinants for neurologic PASC, and\nthe proposed training will facilitate my transition into an independently funded clinician-scientist.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nCervical cancer is the 4th most common female cancer and cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, despite\nbeing preventable through HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination and early detection and treatment of\nprecancerous lesions. In high-income countries, cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates have been reduced\nthrough HPV vaccination and screening based on cytology and HPV testing. However, in low- and middle-income\ncountries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the burden of cervical cancer remains high due to a lack of effective\nprograms for vaccination and screening. While the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends cervical\ncancer screening using a nucleic acid test to detect high-risk HPV DNA, most low- and middle-income countries\nhave difficulty implementing HPV testing due to the high cost of tests, the need for lab infrastructure and trained\npersonnel, and long sample-to-answer times. There is an urgent need for novel, low-cost, accurate, and\naccessible approaches to improve screening.\nThe goal of this project is to develop a point-of-care HPV DNA test that meets WHO goals for cervical cancer\nscreening in low- and middle-income countries by adapting and integrating two innovations: 1) an extraction-\nfree, multiplexed, isothermal nucleic acid amplification assay; and 2) a fully integrated nucleic acid amplification\nand lateral flow detection platform called NATFlow. The resulting NATFlow HPV test will be affordable, rapid,\nand simple to use at the point-of-care. We aim to: 1) adapt existing extraction-free, multiplexed, sample-to-\nanswer Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assays to detect eight high risk types of HPV on the\nNATFlow platform and demonstrate technical functionality with 140 provider-collected clinical specimens; (2)\nevaluate clinical performance of the NATFlow HPV test in Mozambique, first in 558 banked preserved samples\nand then prospectively in 1,890 women undergoing cervical cancer screening at Hospital Central de Maputo and\nsurrounding community clinics; and (3) evaluate barriers/facilitators to cervical cancer screening using the\nNATFlow HPV test in Mozambique.\nWe have assembled an interdisciplinary team based in the US, Mozambique, and Australia with extensive\ncollective experience in developing, evaluating, commercializing, and scaling new technologies to prevent\ncervical cancer. We have a strong record of carrying out translational and implementation research in low- and\nmiddle-income countries including Mozambique. Our industrial team has expertise in developing and translating\nwell-designed instrumentation and chemistries for point-of-care tests. Our team is ideally suited to adapt,\nvalidate, and prepare to scale the NATFlow HPV test to accelerate global efforts to prevent cervical cancer.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Summary\nNovel vaccine strategies is needed to develop a safe, effective, and broadly accessible HIV vaccine to\nend the HIV pandemic. This proposal is built upon several innovative advancements. First, learned from\nnatural immunity observed in a group of HIV resistant Kenyan female sex workers, we found 12 protease\ncleavage sites (PCS) in HIV are critical for virus maturation due to their essential function in tightly\ncontrolled cleavage of Gag, Gag-Pol, and Nef precursor proteins. Sequences surrounding the HIV PCS\nare immunogenic and highly conserved across global HIV subtypes, thereby a vaccine based on 12 PCS\nimmunogens will be globally accessible and likely to prevent virus escape mutations. Further, our recent\nstudies demonstrated that a PCS vaccine delivered by recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)\nvector and nanoformulation protected more than 80% of vaccinated female Mauritian cynomolgus\nmacaques (MCMs) against SIVmac251 intravaginal challenges, which is associated with vaccine elicited\npotent PCS-specific CD8 T cell responses. However, in previous studies, 12 PCS immunogens were\nindividually expressed in the rVSV. To improve vaccine immunogen presentation and facilitate the\nvaccine preparation, 12 PCS immunogens should be expressed in a single cassette, i.e., multi-epitope\nPCS (MEPCS). i.e., multi-epitope PCS (MEPCS). To that end, we have developed a cold-chain friendly\nand long-term stable MEPCS-mRNA-LNP vaccine. We found that SIV MEPCS-mRNA-LNP vaccine\ninduced a potent PCS-specific CD8 T-cell immunity without inducing generalized inflammation and CD4\nT-cell activation. Based on our strong preliminary date, we hypothesize that MEPCS vaccines would\nprotect rhesus macaques against SIVmac251 rectal transmission. The reason we will use a rhesus\nmacaque (RM)-SIV rectal challenge model is that the effectiveness of MEPCS vaccine needs to be\nvalidated in the most rigorous rhesus macaques and anal sex is the most common HIV transmission in\nthe United States of America. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of cold-\nchain friendly and long-term stable MEPCS-mRNA-LNP vaccine in comparison with rVSV-MEPCS\nvaccines in protecting RMs against SIVmac251 intrarectal challenge and to better understand the\nimmune correlated protection. in this proposed study we will comparatively evaluate the effectiveness of\nMEPCS-mRNA-LNP with rVSV-MEPCS vaccines against SIVmac251 intrarectal challenge in RMs. The\nproposed study has the great potential to develop a new HIV/SIV vaccine to prevent HIV/SIV rectal\ntransmission. The novel MEPCS immunogens plus the cold-chain friendly and long-term stable mRNA-\nLNP formulation makes this proposed study highly innovative and significant.\n.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nConstruction of infectious and pathogenic HIV-1, or HSIV -- an essentially HIV-1 backbone having minimal SIV\ngene fragments -- for the simian model will bring tremendous value to studies of AIDS pathogenesis and to\nvaccine and therapeutic reagents. Our preliminary data and previous findings on SHIV demonstrate that not\nthe Env and receptor/co-receptor molecules, but the inability of the entered HIV-1 to activate the initially resting\nlymphocytes is the major culprit for the restriction of HIV-1 replication in monkey cells. Nef of SIVpbj1.9\n(SNef), but not HIV-1, can sufficiently activate T cells such that the entered SIVpbj1.9 replicates robustly in the\nresting T cells, causing the infected monkey to die of AIDS within a few weeks. We accordingly constructed\nchimeric nef, HSNef, which harbors the 5\u2019 309 nucleotides (nts) of SIVpbj1.9 nef in place of the 5\u2019 221 nts of\nHIV-1 nef, non-overlapping region with the long terminal repeat (LTR), and first tested whether the recombinant\nNef can activate T cells. Our data showed that HSNef itself sufficiently activated resting T cells, manifested by\nIL2 generation and Nef-triggered IL2-promoter activity, while HIV-1 Nef (HNef) did not. Further, remarkably,\ninfection of HSIVnef -- which harbors all functional HIV-1 genes, except a small fragment of the SIVpbj1.9 nef,\nHSNef, within an HIV-1 provirus -- into resting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMC) integrated\nits provirus into host chromosomes without mitogenic activation and thereby replicated in the initially resting\nhPBMC, whereas HIV-1 could not. These data demonstrated that the small fragment of SIVpbj1.9 nef in HIV-1\nbackbone was sufficient for replication of the entered HIV-1. Moreover, consistent with the SHIV replication\nstudies in monkeys, HSIVnef comprising HIV-1 Env replicated robustly in activated monkey PBMC (mPBMC),\nagain confirming that Env is not a restriction factor for HIV-1 entry into simian host. These data fundamentally\nilluminate the molecular function of Nef in pathogenicity for development of the HIV-1/simian AIDS model.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Discovery of Human HLA T Cell Epitopes in Human Metapneumovirus\nHMPV is a leading cause of lower respiratory infection in children and adults worldwide. Although nearly all\npeople are infected with HMPV by age 5 years, immunity to HMPV is incomplete and re-infections occur\nthroughout life. More severe disease occurs in persons with underlying conditions such as asthma, chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease, HIV, or prematurity. Data from our group and others shows that T cells are\nimportant to clear infection in mice and humans, yet T cell response can also contribute to disease severity.\nThus, characterizing the human T cell response to HMPV is important to guide safe and effective vaccine\ndevelopment.\nOur lab has established methods to discover human MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes using HLA-transgenic\n(huHLA-tg) mice and human PBMCs. The huHLA-tg mice express different HLA supertypes, which collectively\ncapture a large proportion of different HLA alleles among diverse human populations. We propose to apply\nthese methods to discover HLA-restricted HMPV epitopes recognized by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. We will\nscreen both overlapping peptide pools and predictope peptides by ELISPOT against T cells derived from\nhuHLA-tg mice infected with HMPV. Individual epitope peptides that are confirmed by ELISpot will be ordered\nas tetramers from the NIH Tetramer Core. Tetramers will be used to thoroughly analyze and characterize\nHMPV epitope-specific CD8+ T cells, including: effector molecule production such as IFN-\u03b3, TNF, IL-2,\nperforin, and granzyme; degranulation using CD107a; transcription factor profile; and inhibitory receptor\nexpression. Dominant epitopes confirmed by tetramer staining will be tested for protective efficacy using\npeptide vaccination and live virus challenge of mice. HLA-typed human PBMCs will be used to confirm bone\nfide recognition of the epitopes by human CD8+ T cells. The results of this project will identify widely shared\nHMPV epitopes that can be used to design candidate vaccines and evaluate the response to any HMPV\nvaccine. These tools will be needed to understand human immune responses to both natural infection and\nvaccines, which is important given the immune-mediated pathology associated with HMPV.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Targeting hepatitis B virus cccDNA during HBV/HIV co-infection",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project summary\nCoinfection with HBV and HIV-1 is common, and HIV coinfection can exacerbate progression of viral hepatitis and\naccelerate liver disease progression. In fact, endstage liver diseases, including fiboris/cirrhosis and hepatocellular\ncarcinoma, have become the most common causes of death in people living with HIV (PWH) worldwide. HIV\ninfection cannot be cured currently but can be efficiently suppressed with highly active or combination anti-retroviral\ntherapy (HAART or cART). Currently available HBV drugs can suppress viral replication, but only a small subset of\npatients are cured by these treatments. Although a prophylactic vaccine is available for HBV, it has no therapeutic\nbenefit. Consequently, new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to combat chronic HBV infection,\nparticularly in the context of HIV coinfection. Here, we will capitalize on several technical and conceptual\nbreakthroughs from our lab to establish proof-of-concept for interfering with persistent HBV infection virologically.\nWe have recently made important discoveries that provide a strong foundation for the major direction of this\nproposal. The Ploss lab identified key components of the DNA lagging strand synthesis machinery that are\nnecessary and sufficient for formation of HBV cccDNA, the replication intermediate crucial for viral persistence.\nClinical data from HBV patients indicate that cccDNA turnover occurs relatively rapidly (several months), offering a\npossibility of curing HBV with finite therapy by completely blocking cccDNA replenishment. Thus, we aim to\ndetermine whether liver-specific transient genetic disruption of polymerases and other co-factors in vivo can\nabrogate HBV infection (Aim 1). Since we recently demonstrated that HBV cccDNA formation is supported in mouse\nhepatocytes, we can take advantage of the power of mouse genetics to rigorously test our hypothesis that genetic\ndistruption of host factors involved in cccDNA formation can abrogate HBV infection. Furthermore, we will extend\nour analysis to blocking HBV chronicity in the context of an underlying HIV coinfection (Aim 2). To achieve this\ngoal, we will take advantage of a novel humanized mouse model co-engrafted with HLA-matched human\nhepatocytes and components of a human hematolymphoid system. Our preliminary data demonstrate that such\ndually engrafted mice support chronic infections with both HBV and HIV and can mount antigen-specific T cell\nresponses. This humanized mouse model provides unprecedented opportunities for studying the complex interplay\nof HBV/HIV co-infections and will be deployed here to test rigorously whether blocking HBV cccDNA formation can\nabrogate HBV persistence.\nWe will capitalize on our extensive complementary expertises in virology and immunology of HIV-1/HBV (Su),\nhepatitis viruses (Ploss) and humanized mouse technology to achieve these exciting aims. Our work will advance\nthe field of HBV and HIV-1 research by showing that a novel small animal model can be successfully used to\nunderstand HIV/HBV coinfection and immune responses and to model treatments for the associated liver disease.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nThe emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern is threatening global health and our ability to\nprevent COVID-19 disease, raising concerns about a potential new wave of the pandemic. HIV may complicate\nthe trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to eradicate the virus. While most people with a\ncompetent immune system successfully clear SARS-CoV-2 infection within days, people living with HIV with\nweakened immunity can carry persistent infection for months. Individuals with immunodeficiency may also\nhave a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection that can further extend the duration of infectiousness with high\nviral load. As a result, chronically infected individuals are potentially contagious for an extended period of time\nand may sustain transmission in the community. Similar to other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 accumulates mutations\nover time as it replicates within the host. Therefore, chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of a\nweakened immune system may provide the time and the environment needed for the virus to replicate and\nevolve genetic mutations associated with survival advantages, including increased transmissibility and\nresistance to COVID-19 vaccines or treatment. The proposed research aims to understand the overall impact\nof HIV infection on the SARS-CoV-2 viral evolution and transmission dynamics in a setting with high HIV\nprevalence. We will address current knowledge gaps by integrating SARS-CoV-2 genomic data, patient-level\nclinical data, and epidemiological data to achieve the following aims: 1) we will determine the effect of HIV\ninfection on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants; and 2) we will\ndetermine the effect of HIV-associated immunosuppression on the acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. For\nthe first Aim, advanced phylodynamic methods will be applied to determine how HIV affects the transmission\nand viral evolution of SARS-CoV-2 on a population scale, as well as to describe risk factors that drive\nindividual and population-level COVID-19 transmission. For the second Aim, we will recruit and follow a cohort\nof COVID-19 patients with and without HIV infection to determine the effect of HIV-associated\nimmunosuppression on the rate of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations. The proposed research will also utilize\nactive case finding to minimize sampling bias. Findings from this project will inform the development of optimal\npublic health interventions to control the pandemic by disrupting transmission chains and prevent the\nemergence and spread of alarming variants.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nA number of anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting highly conserved and vulnerable\nepitope regions of the envelope glycoprotein (Env) are being investigated for a range of clinical applications\nbased on their ability to robustly prevent infection in a variety of animal models. Successful monoclonal\nantibody (mAb) prophylaxis aims to offer an alternative to vaccine development efforts, and the relatively long\nhalf-lives and tolerability profiles of bNAbs promise to offer a complement to the small-molecule inhibitors\ncomprising current pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) options.\nWhile bNAbs represent a promising approach to provide protection from infection, suppress plasma and tissue\nviremia, and reduce viral reservoirs, results from the first major bNAb prevention efficacy trial were mixed.\nProtection against infection with neutralization susceptible strains was observed, but fewer strains were\nsufficiently susceptible than anticipated, and overall efficacy criteria were not met.\nOur objective is to define and refine the means by which bNAbs can be used to restrict HIV replication in vivo\nusing a more stringent model in which their ability to delay or prevent systemic viremia in the context of seeded\nHIV infection is monitored. We hypothesize that the antiviral activity afforded by a single bNAb can be\nenhanced by one or more of two distinct strategies that will be rigorously tested for in vivo antiviral activity by\nbenchmarking their ability to delay detectable plasma viremia in the context of spreading infection. Guided by\nstrong preliminary data, the project goals will be achieved though completion of two Specific Aims: 1) Define\nthe ability of Fc engineering to improve bNAb antiviral activity across diverse envelope epitopes, 2) Define the\nability of bNAb combinations, with and without Fc engineering to improve bNAb antiviral activity. Each strategy\nwill be evaluated for effects on neutralization and effector function in vitro and in vivo for the ability to delay or\nprevent systemic viremia.\nCollectively, these studies will generate unprecedented insights into the means whereby bNAbs, if introduced in\nearly infection after mucosal exposure, delay or restrict viral spread thereby lowering the viral burden and\nimproving outcomes. This work will inform on both next-generation rational vaccine design and the ongoing\ndeployment of bNAb prophylaxis and therapy\u2014driving innovation relevant to combatting HIV acquisition and\ntransmission across diverse intervention strategies and populations.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nVaccine-mediated protection against viral pathogens frequently depends on neutralizing antibodies. However,\nthe HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein gp120 is heavily and variably glycosylated, resulting in a dynamic shield\nthat occludes conserved neutralization epitopes, impeding development of vaccination strategies to induce\nneutralization of diverse viral strains. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) sometimes develop during chronic\nHIV-1 infection, but limited information exists about how to recapitulate this process with vaccination. However,\nevidence points to specific characteristics of the virus that establishes a new infection, the transmitted/founder\n(T/F), and subsequent diversification of the Env viral quasispecies as important modulators for breadth\ndevelopment. In our previous study, a vaccine expressing a novel clade C T/F Env (identified as Z1800M) from\na person living with HIV (PLWH) who developed elite plasma neutralization breadth, elicited the same tier 2\nautologous neutralization specificity in immunized rhesus macaques (RM) as in early infection. The targeted\nepitope comprised the V5 loop and portions of the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) on the Z1800M T/F Env gp120,\nboth highly exposed due to a pronounced lack of glycan coverage. Interestingly, exposure of CD4 contact\nresidues was modulated by naturally occurring changes in V5 in early escape variants. These results support\nthat this Env could potentially be exploited to maximize exposure of the CD4bs. To complement these results,\nwe acquired an extensive set of longitudinal Env sequences from PLWH Z1800M that supports strong selective\npressure during infection on two regions comprising bnAb epitopes: the CD4bs and V2 apex. Leveraging on this\nwealth of data, we will use an innovative combination of sequence-based bioinformatic tools, artificial intelligence\nand machine learning based in silico structural prediction approaches, and in vitro biochemical and immunologic\nstudies to select HIV-1 envelope vaccine immunogens that maximize exposure of epitopes recognized by\nbroadly neutralizing antibodies, including the CD4bs. We proposed to immunize nonhuman primates with the\nZ1800M T/F Env to expose the CD4bs and sequentially boost with three longitudinal Envs down selected from\nhundreds of sequences using our in silico and in vitro methods to maximize epitope exposure during vaccination.\nWe predict that this strategy will transition antibodies from autologous to heterologous neutralization, leading to\na translatable vaccine approach to advance into clinical studies.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nAs of March 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 50 million infections and 2 million\ndeaths, constituting an unprecedented pandemic in the modern world. While infected individuals\nrapidly develop IgG responses against the viral Spike after infection, some studies have\nindicated that individuals with mild infection generate weaker neutralizing Ab responses\ncompared to those with severe disease. The durability of the immune response following natural\ninfection and its afforded protection against subsequent infections and emerging related variants\nremain unclear. Interestingly, unlike other respiratory viruses, children are rarely develop severe\ndisease following SARS CoV-2 infection. Antibody responses in hospitalized children and those\nwho developed the multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) have been characterized, but,\nthere is a gap in knowledge of the magnitude, quality, durability, and breadth of antibody\nresponses in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children, responses that may contribute to\nmaking children less susceptible to severe infection compared to adults. Moreover, the\npossibiltiy of reinfection or infection with a novel variant in previously-infected children is not\nknown, making the possibility of restarting congregate settings for children without a childhood\nvaccine quite challenging. Our overarching goal is to characterize the kinetics, function,\nbreadth, and durability of humoral immune responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection across\nthe pediatric age spectrum in comparison to that of adults. We hypothesize that pediatric\nimmune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection is distinct from that of adults, and associates with\nprotection against symptomatic disease and durability of immunity. Using samples from two\nunique ongoing community studies of SARS-CoV-2 infections in adults and children, we will test\nour hypothesis through the following aims: 1) Define the similarities and differences in the\nkinetics, magnitude, specificity, function and durability of SARS-CoV-2-specific Ab responses in\nchildren and adults; 2) Investigate the breadth and potency of antibody responses in SARS-\nCoV-2-infected children against established and predicted variants of SARS-CoV-2; and 3)\nDefine the SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell repertoire and characterize the potency of pediatric\nSARS CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibodies. These evaluations will identify immune correlates\nof protection against severe disease and provide insights for immunization strategies towards\nthe long term control of SARS CoV-2 which will likely become an endemic pathogen.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nAccelerating B Cell and Antibody Molecular, Functional and Structural Analysis\n in Sequential bnAb-inducing Env Immunogen Clinical Trials\n Development of an effective HIV vaccine is essential for achieving long-term immunity to prevent new HIV\ninfections globally. A successful HIV vaccine regimen will likely need to induce potent broad neutralizing\nantibodies (bnAbs) to contemporary circulating viral strains. New HIV Env immunogen designs, guided by\nknowledge of bnAb interactions with envelope epitopes and their B cell clonal lineage development in natural\nHIV infection, have entered first in human studies in the HVTN. These phase 1 \u201cdiscovery\u201d trials rely on more\nefficient, near real-time molecular, functional, and structural analyses of B cell and antibody responses. To meet\nthis expectation, the HVTN Laboratory Center proposes to continue expansion and improvement of laboratory\nand analytical capacity that can accelerate iterative evaluation of bnAb-inducing vaccine candidates. The\nsupplemental funds for the HVTN Laboratory make it possible to fully access evolving immunologic, molecular,\nand structural technology, which deepens our laboratory analyses and increases throughput of data generation\nand interpretation. To accomplish this, we will sustain the employment of additional dedicated trained staff and\nequipment to increase laboratory throughput of B cell repertoire, antibody binding with epitope mapping,\nneutralization, and antibody structural analyses. These funds will continue to enable efficient laboratory\noperations and integration of the scientific partnerships between key investigators at Fred Hutch, Duke\nUniversity, and the Scripps Research Institute.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project summary\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes more deaths worldwide than any other infectious agent and is\nincreasingly characterized by antimicrobial resistance. An effective vaccination strategy to prevent establishment\nof M.tb infection and progression to tuberculosis (TB) disease is a priority to achieve rapid control of the global\nTB epidemic, but development and clinical testing of new vaccines is hampered by the lack of immune correlates\nof protection. Revaccination of adolescents with the only licenced vaccine against TB, Bacille Calmette-Guerin\n(BCG), partially protected against established M.tb infection, providing the first efficacy signal for a novel TB\nvaccination strategy in a high-risk population. There is a one-time opportunity to leverage this existing cohort, as\nwell as newly enrolled participants in a larger confirmatory phase 2b clinical trial, to identify and test the durability\nof immune correlates of protection against established M.tb infection in the lung, which could harbour critically\ndifferent immune responses compared to peripheral blood.\nBlood and bronchoalveaolar lavage specimens will be collected to identify and determine longevity of vaccine-\ninduced systemic and pulmonary immune responses that correlate with protection against sustained M.tb\ninfection. The durability of vaccine-induced protection against infection ~6 years after vaccination will also be\nexplored.\nNovel and robust technologies, such as polychromatic flow cytometry, mass cytometry and systems serology will\nbe applied to study adaptive and innate immune responses in participants enrolled in two BCG efficacy trials at\n6 months and ~6 years after vaccination as well as 1 month and 4-5 years after primary M.tb infection. The\noverarching hypothesis is that BCG vaccination induced multiple arms of the immune system and that a\ncombination of Th1/Th17 and IgA responses is associated with lower risk of established M.tb infection.\nThis approach will: 1) Identify and assess durability of BCG-mediated systemic and pulmonary immune\nresponses in M.tb-uninfected individuals; 2) Define systemic and pulmonary immune correlates of post-\nM.tb exposure protection against established M.tb infection in participants experiencing transient (protected)\nor sustained (unprotected) M.tb infection. Identification of vaccine-induced immune responses important for\nprotection against established M.tb infection would enhance our understanding of early containment of M.tb and\ncould inform immune correlates of protection against TB disease.\nBy extending the follow-up of the first BCG revaccination trial and comparing rates of M.tb infection in participants\nfrom the BCG and placebo arms, we will also 3) Measure the durability of vaccine-mediated prevention of\nsustained M.tb infection for at least 6 years post-vaccination, which, if significant, would provide impetus to\nconduct larger trials testing for efficacy to prevent TB disease in endemic populations.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Delineating HIV-1 nuclear import mechanisms through capsid interaction with MxB and the nuclear pore complex",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) causes life-long infection, which requires taking antiviral drugs to\ncontrol the infection. No vaccines are available against this virus. The HIV-1 cone-shaped capsid core, made up\nof capsid protein (CA), protects the HIV-1 genome, plays a major role in HIV-1 infection and interacts with several\nhost factors involved in nuclear import of viral complexes and integration into the host genome. The myxovirus\nresistance protein B (MxB) is thought to restrict HIV-1 infection by inhibiting uncoating and blocking nuclear entry,\nthe latter measure by 2-Long Terminal Repeats (2-LTR) circles inside the nucleus. However, MxB does not\ninhibit the appearance of CA inside the nucleus of infected cells, even when infection is inhibited. Additionally,\nmeasuring 2-LTR circles in the nucleus, which is a marker for HIV-1 nuclear import, does not correlate with\nproductive infection. Currently, little is known about the kinetics and sites of HIV-1 uncoating and the role of MxB\nin regulating this process. HIV-1 nuclear import is also not completely understood. Several nucleoporins (NUPs),\nwhich form the nuclear pore complex (NPC), interact with CA to promote HIV-1 nuclear import. The NPC was\npreviously thought to be a static structure with an inner diameter of ~40nm, too small to allow nuclear import of\nthe 60nm-wide HIV-1 capsid core, leading to an assumption that HIV-1 has to uncoat before entering the nucleus.\nHowever, recent evidence suggests that NPC is a dynamic structure that may expand and that HIV-1 cone-\nshaped cores can enter the nucleus. Little is known about how the NPC and MxB interactions with HIV-1 CA\nrespectively promote or inhibit HIV-1 infection. Therefore, I hypothesize that the NPC-associated MxB blocks\nnuclear import by inhibiting uncoating and that the nuclear import of HIV-1 core requires expansion of\nthe nuclear pore complex. In the two Specific Aims of this proposal, I will investigate the HIV-1 nuclear import\nand CA core disassembly in the presence of MxB (Aim 1) and delineate the changes in nuclear pore architecture\ncaused by HIV-1 (Aim 2) using advance microscopy techniques. In Aim 1, I will determine HIV-1 nuclear entry\ninhibition by MxB through visualizing the presence of fluorescently labeled integrase-superfolderGFP (INsfGFP)\ninside the nucleus. I will also examine HIV-1 uncoating by visualizing loss of a fluorescently labeled cyclophilin\nA derivative, which binds to CA with high avidity. In Aim 2, I will examine changes in the nuclear pore size upon\nHIV-1 infection using super-resolution microscopy. I will infect NUP-labeled cells with HIV-1 CA mutant, which\nfails to transport to the nucleoplasm and remains associated with NPC. I will then visualize the NPC with\nStimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy and Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy\n(STORM). This project will provide me with diverse training in virology, cell biology and advanced microscopy\ntechniques and will advance our understanding of HIV-1 nuclear import mechanisms. In the long-term, my work\nmay support development of novel antiviral drugs that can mitigate HIV-1 infection.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Research Abstract: The spike/fusion glycoproteins residing on the surface of human enveloped viruses are\ntargets of immune response and are the focus of researchers developing vaccines and antiviral treatments. The\nconformational dynamics of spike proteins drive the entry of enveloped viruses into cells via viral membrane\nfusion and facilitate antibody recognition. However, the lack of deep insights into dynamics has prevented a\ncomplete elucidation of the molecular mechanism by which spike proteins promote virus entry. Many viruses,\nsuch as coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and HIV-1, share a similar viral fusion\nmechanism (type-I) mediated by their respective spike proteins. These spikes undergo dramatic structural\nchanges, and the energy released from conformational transitions overcomes the fusion kinetic barriers.\nHowever, our understanding of the multi-step fusion process mainly relies on individual structural snapshots of\nspike proteins at fusion endpoints. How these endpoints are correlated in a time-resolved manner and the order\nand frequency of conformational events underlying virus entry remain largely elusive. The proposed research\nextends our efforts to explore viral membrane fusion and is supported by our experience probing the\nconformational dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoproteins. The overarching\ngoal of this project is to integrate our knowledge into a generic working model that will describe a time-resolved\nstepwise framework of the type-I fusion mechanism, in which the conformational trajectories of fusion proteins\nare explicitly defined in space and time. We pioneered the use of the single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy\ntransfer (smFRET) to study S and revealed multiple S conformations on the virus. We delineated sequential\ntransitions of S from closed to open conformations upon activation by cellular receptors. We provided the first\nexperimental evidence of decelerated transition dynamics from open states, suggesting increased stability of the\nfusion-reactive open state to be part of the SARS-CoV-2 adaption strategies. Here, we will use an integrated\nplatform of smFRET and virus-to-cell fusion in combination with computational and structural tools to reveal the\nconformational plasticity S adapts during virus evolution and to visualize the conformational trajectory S\nundergoes during fusion. We will perform comparative studies on another respiratory virus - RSV fusion (F)\nprotein, with interest in other type-I spike proteins of newly emerging viruses. We will elucidate conformational\nevents and transition dynamics of F-mediated viral membrane fusion and evaluate whether conformation-\npresentation of F-based vaccine candidates represents the predominant state exposed to the host. The studies\nare expected to allow us to identify the common and divergent traits of the S- and F-mediated fusion processes\nthat will advance our knowledge and help us define the common theme of the type-I fusion mechanism. We\nenvision that this program of research using different advanced technologies will reveal unrecognized insights\ninto virus entry that lay the foundation for advances in anti-viral interventions, in line with the mission of NIGMS.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nMore than 44,000 new cases of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) are reported globally each year, 84% of which occur in\nAfrica. This and other Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-induced malignancies predominate in\npeople with acquired or iatrogenic immunodeficiencies. Although KSHV can be detected in other human body\nfluids, its frequent detection in saliva in groups both with and without risk of sexually transmitted infections (e.g.,\nchildren) suggests that the oral cavity is the site of primary acquisition. However, the mechanism of KSHV oral\ntransmission in vivo, particularly the critical viral envelope glycoproteins (gps) required for viral entry,\nremains unresolved. Several KSHV\u2013host interactions have been identified, but all prior experiments were\nperformed in vitro and have not been validated in vivo due to prior lack of an appropriate animal model. Through\ncollaboration with the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, our laboratory has access to the common\nmarmoset (Callithrix jacchus, CJ), a recently developed KSHV non-human primate model that is susceptible to\nKSHV oral infection, and under immunosuppression acquires KS-like skin lesions. The objective of this\napplication is to elucidate the minimum gps required to initiate primary oral infection in vivo, as a prerequisite to\nselecting key gps for developing an effective prophylactic vaccine candidate. This application builds on Dr.\nOgembo\u2019s recently completed NCI K01 CA184388-05 research on KSHV entry mechanisms and vaccine\ndevelopment. Recently, we showed that in vitro, the KSHV glycoprotein gH/gL is essential for viral infection of\nepithelial, endothelial, and fibroblasts cells, but not B cells. Notably, we and others have also shown that both\nmonoclonal and polyclonal Abs to KSHV glycoproteins gB, gH/gL, and gpK8.1, can neutralize KSHV infection of\ndiverse permissive human cells in vitro. Building on this success, we generated KSHV deletion mutants lacking\nthe four glycoproteins thought to be critical for viral entry (gB, gH/gL, gpK8.1) and various monoclonal antibodies\nspecific to these gps. In this project, we will use human ex vivo samples and the CJ KSHV model to test the\nhypothesis that gB and gH/gL are critical for KSHV in vivo oral transmission. The premise of our proposal is\nbuilt on strong evidence that 1) KSHV can infect CJ, which develop KS-like skin lesions, and 2) Abs against the\nKSHV glycoproteins gB and gH/gL can neutralize KSHV infection in vitro and ex vivo. Furthermore, the\npermissiveness to KSHV infection of human cells ex vivo and CJ makes these platforms ideal to test the KSHV\ngp requirements for infection. Successful completion of the proposed study will elucidate the minimum KSHV\ngps required for primary infection in ex vivo and in vivo models, advancing our long-term goal of defining the\ninitial steps in KSHV infection of humans and the role of antibodies in protecting against the early steps of KSHV\ntransmission. This will ultimately inform design and development of prophylactic vaccines that can prevent KSHV\ninfection and its associated cancers.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nSignificant research has gone into the development of a safe and effective vaccine for HIV-1.\nAlthough many strategies have been attempted; none has been successfully established. Even a\npartially effective vaccine could decrease the number of people who are infected with HIV, further\nreducing the number of people who can pass the virus on to others. By substantially reducing the\nnumber of new infections, we could eventually stop the pandemic. To date, the elicitation of\nbroadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) has proven extremely difficult to achieve which brought\na lot of effort on the novel trimer design and modification. At the same time, it was found that\ninduced HIV- specific CD8+ T cell responses could limit both the transmission and establishment\nof persistent viral reservoirs. All the evidence suggest that no individual factor will determine the\nultimate success of a bNAb-inducing HIV-1 vaccine, which will likely require a combination of\nefficient precursor B cell priming, optimization of Env design and presentation, sustained\nheterologous Env boosting, a T cell-based strategy, and newly developed delivery systems or\nadjuvants. Adjuvants or delivery systems can stimulate different arms of the immune system and\nare vital components of subunit vaccines, especially in the case of poorly immunogenic envelope\nglycoprotein. Deliver systems can also be designed to address instability of mRNA-based\nvaccines. The goal of this program is therefore to overcome challenges with HIV-1 vaccination\nand deliver a safe and effective vaccine using a biocompatible, biodegradable, easily\nmanufactured short carbon nanotube (CNTVac) platform. Env-trimer and mRNA encoding\npeptide will be antigens for delivery and will target generation of both humoral and cellular\nresponses. A humanized mouse model and a non-human primate model will be used for\nimmunogenicity and efficacy studies. As the novel non-viral gene transfer vector for HIV-1 vaccine\ndelivery, we will establish methodology for potential GMP production and generate safety profiles\nunder FDA requirements.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is a critical cancer control intervention, particularly in resource-\nconstrained health systems with limited access to screening and treatment services. Malawi, like many African\ncountries, has introduced a national HPV vaccine program targeting preadolescent girls \u2013 but coverage remains\nvery low. Clinician recommendation of HPV vaccination is a highly effective evidence-based intervention for\nincreasing uptake of the vaccine, but there is little information on how to encourage clinicians in low- and middle-\nincome countries to deliver this recommendation.\nThe Kupewa project (\u201cprevent\u201d in Chichewa) aims to (A) identify the optimal implementation strategies for\nincreasing clinician recommendation of HPV vaccination for girls and young women aged 9-24 who are living\nwith HIV in Malawi; (B) refine this set of optimized strategies by including information about the strategies\u2019\nimplementability; and (C) ultimately identify the set of strategies that are effective, implementable, and show\nsustained effects 18 months after the intervention ends. The study is informed by the Theoretical Domains\nFramework and the World Health Organization\u2019s Behavioural and Social Drivers (BeSD) of vaccination\nframework.\nTo our knowledge, this would be among the first applications of intervention optimization alongside\nimplementation science, and among the first to be conducted in a low-income country. The project will leverage\na robust research partnership between institutions and highly-qualified investigators in Malawi and the U.S., with\nengagement of partners from the Malawi Ministry of Health in all phases, from conceptualization to study\nexecution and results interpretation and dissemination.\nClinician-facing implementation strategies to promote vaccination recommendation in low- and middle-income\ncountries are understudied but urgently needed to accelerate HPV vaccination programs globally. This study will\nprovide much-needed insight into ways to promote clinician recommendation of HPV vaccination to the highest-\nrisk girls and young women in the country with the second-highest burden of cervical cancer globally.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT/SUMMARY\nCervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Zambia, where HIV prevalence is also high (11.3%).\nHIV heightens the risk of developing and dying from cervical cancer. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine\nis a WHO-endorsed, evidence-based tool that can prevent 90% of cervical cancers, and is recommended for\ngirls ages 9-14. However, HPV vaccine coverage is low (16%) in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs),\nand our team's on-the-ground experience suggests HPV vaccination is even lower in Zambia, particularly\namong girls with HIV, who are most at risk of poor cancer outcomes. Currently, HPV vaccination is\ndelivered via school-based campaigns, which are viewed as efficient for broad coverage but also exclude the\nmost vulnerable children\u2014those out-of-school or who irregularly attend (e.g., orphans, poor). Adolescents\nliving with HIV (ALHIV) are more likely to have these additional vulnerabilities. In addition, WHO recommends\nALHIV receive a 3rd dose of the HPV vaccine, which is not given in traditional 2-dose school-based campaigns.\nTo ensure that ALHIV have access to the WHO-recommended 3-doses, we propose to integrate HPV\nvaccination into routine care in adolescent HIV clinics. Adolescent HIV clinics in Zambia have regular\ncontact with ALHIV and are trusted sources of health information for the community. Given the known\nchallenges of providing cervical cancer prevention in LMICs, including Zambia (e.g., stigma, misinformation,\nstaffing, supply chain), integrating HPV vaccination requires a multilevel approach, stakeholder\nengagement, and diversified implementation strategies. To achieve success, we will co-design a package\nof implementation strategies using a previously successful implementation research approach developed for\ncervical cancer prevention in LMICs: the Integrative Systems Praxis for Implementation Research (INSPIRE).\nINSPIRE is a novel, formal, and comprehensive framework to develop, implement, and evaluate\nimplementation science efforts. Following key elements of INSPIRE, our specific aims are to: 1) Identify the\nunique multilevel contextual factors (barriers and facilitators) across HIV settings (rural, urban, peri-urban) that\ninfluence HPV vaccine uptake; 2) Use Implementation Mapping to translate stakeholder feedback and findings\nfrom Aim 1 into a package of implementation strategies to integrate HPV vaccine into HIV clinics; 3) Conduct a\nHybrid Type 3 effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate the package of multilevel implementation\nstrategies for integrating HPV vaccine into HIV clinics. Our research team has significant expertise in HIV,\nHPV, cancer prevention, implementation science, and LMIC research. Wehave strong institutional backing,\nincluding$325,000 over the course of the study;strong support, technical expertise, and resources (e.g.,\nvaccines) from the Zambian Ministry of Health; and political will for scale-up. If successful, this\nstakeholder-based implementation model could be transported to HIV clinics across Zambia and serve as a\nmodel to address cancer prevention priorities for those with HIV in other LMICs.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nThis proposal addresses NIMH\u2019s call for HIV vaccine preparedness and \u201cHIV vaccine-related\u201d communication\nresearch (Notice of Special Interest NOT-MH-21-105). Though vaccines may be years away, the NOSI\nrecognizes that the time to conduct rigorous HIV vaccine communication research is now \u2013 to advance the\nbasic science of effective HIV vaccine messaging and get ahead of misinformation.\nHIV disproportionately impacts young Black women living in the Southern US. Black women make up 13% of\nthe female population in the US, yet make up 54% of new HIV infections among women in the US. These\ndisparities are most extreme in the South, where black women account for 72% of new HIV infections among\nwomen. These data highlight the urgent need to develop and scale-up biomedical HIV prevention strategies\ncentered on the unique needs of Black women in the South. Herein, we propose to develop and test a multi-\ncomponent communications intervention to promote uptake of a future HIV vaccine, as part of a\ncomprehensive set of strategies for HIV prevention, among Black women ages 18\u201334 in the South. Our\ndiverse team of HIV clinicians, behavioral scientists and health communication experts includes faculty from\nTexas Southern University, the 2nd largest Historically Black College and University (HBCU) in the US. This\nfive-year study will take place in Houston, Texas, an epicenter of the HIV epidemic in the US South. We will\nuse community based participatory research methods (CBPR) and Community Engagement Studios to engage\nyoung Black women in co-creating and testing communication content across multiple components (i.e., words,\ngraphics, videos). To increase uptake of a future HIV vaccine, we will conduct the following aims: 1) Assess\nbarriers and facilitators to uptake of a future HIV vaccine within the larger family of biomedical HIV prevention\ntools, 2) Co-create theory-based message features (i.e., strategic word choice/ framing), graphics, and short\nvideos (30-120 seconds) for uptake of a future HIV vaccine. Theory-based features include enhanced active\nchoice, protective agency assignment, autonomy restoration, anticipated affect. 3) Evaluate the effect of\ndifferent theory-based message features, graphics and videos on HIV vaccine and prevention intention. We will\nevaluate effects in three separate randomized trials of young Black women. This proposal takes a rigorous\napproach to understanding the basic behavioral science of HIV vaccine communication. Communications\nresearch is needed to understand how to develop messages that address distinct barriers to seeking out HIV\nprevention (i.e., stigma, discrimination, medical mistrust, low risk perception, lack of awareness or knowledge)\nand at the same time, leverage personal and social factors that resonate with Black women (e.g., social\nnetworks, peer structures, and images and narratives that tap into the lived experiences of Black women). If\nsuccessful, this model of message design may translate to other long-acting forms of HIV prevention in\ndevelopment (e.g. once a year implants, injectables, and broadly neutralizing antibody infusions).",

During the current funding period, the HVTN has\ntransformed HIV prevention science by taking two HIV vaccine concepts and the broadly neutralizing monoclonal\nantibody (mAb) VRC01 from phase 1 to efficacy evaluation. We have added over 35 clinical trial sites in sub-\nSaharan Africa and now have over 12,500 participants enrolled in randomized controlled efficacy trials.\nWe propose to continue our scientific leadership in HIV vaccines. The scientific pipeline for vaccines with the\npotential to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to HIV has markedly expanded. This proposal\ndescribes a novel fast-track phase 1 program to assess, in an iterative fashion, candidate trimers, germline or\nlineage-based vaccines designed to elicit bnAbs in adults. A phase 1 program to investigate these vaccines in\nHIV-1\u2013exposed infants is also proposed. The HVTN currently has five HIV efficacy trials in place. Two vaccine\ntrials (HVTN 702 & 705) are in progress; a third (HVTN 706) will start in August 2019; and we are collaborating\nwith the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) on two antibody-mediated prevention (AMP) trials evaluating the\ninfusion of passively administered mAbs. These efficacy trials will define the potential of neutralizing and/or non-\nneutralizing antibodies to prevent HIV acquisition. The samples and statistical design of the efficacy trials are\ndeveloped around correlates of protection; we will continue to develop the robust integrated laboratory, statistical\nand computational platform needed to define these correlates. We will also continue to expand our behavioral\nsciences program to enhance our already successful recruitment and retention programs, and to continue to\nexpand the enrollment of persons of color and transgender persons into HVTN trials.\nVaccine clinical trials involve a complex interplay between clinical trial sites, HVTN laboratories, computational\nscientists, and our operational, training, mentoring, and fiscal management teams; these interactions are\ndescribed in the application. The clinical, laboratory and statistical infrastructure we have built for HIV vaccines\nwill also be used to assist in tuberculosis (TB) vaccine development. Importantly, we will build on our success in\nthe unique community-based programs and integration of community representatives and community advisory\nboards into HVTN research process and conduct. We will also continue to develop the next generation of vaccine\nscientists and expand our scientific collaborations to engage the scientific community to utilize the extensive\nspecimen and data repositories we have established. The overall goal of the HVTN in this proposal is to develop\na vaccine regimen or combination mAb regimen that will reduce HIV acquisition in adults and infants by more\nthan 60 percent.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infects one-third of the world\u2019s population and causes almost 1.3 million\ndeaths per year, including 100, 000 children. Approximately 90% of infected persons have latent tuberculosis\ninfection (LTBI), have protective immunity and remain well, but 10% develop primary tuberculosis (TB) soon\nafter infection or reactivation TB many years later. Children are more susceptible to TB infection, due to an\nimmature immune system. HIV infection in children markedly increases susceptibility to TB, and HIV-infected\npersons with LTBI have an 800-fold greater risk of developing active TB (www.cdc.gov/tb/). TB is the leading\ncause of death in HIV-infected persons and more than half a million coinfected people die annually. To develop\nadequate prophylaxis or therapy, it is important to understand immune responses to Mtb. Identification of HIV+\nchildren with LTBI who are at greatly increased risk for development of TB would allow treating only high-risk\nchildren, facilitating completion of therapy for LTBI and preventing future development of TB. To identify these\nchildren, it is important to pinpoint the nature of the defective immune responses that permit development of\nactive TB in HIV+LTBI+ pediatric patients.\n Over the past 18 years, we have published a series of articles demonstrating that human NK cells have\nthe potential to contribute to both innate and adaptive immune responses to Mtb. Our recently published\nstudies demonstrate that memory-like NK cells contribute to vaccine-induced protective immunity against Mtb\nand IL-21 is required for expansion of memory-like NK cells in both humans and mice. Based on our\npublished studies, we hypothesize that HIV-LTBI+ children household contacts have defective\nmemory-like NK cell expansion compared to HIV-LTBI+ adult household contacts and these defects are\nmore severe in HIV+ LTBI+ children. The proposed studies in the current application will be performed in\nIndia as a part of RePORT-India consortium. This study will leverage the large Indo-US investment and TB/HIV\nresearch consortium of RePORT-India which has developed cohorts of TB cases and household contacts in\nIndia and has paired Indian investigators with US investigators at 6 sites. Already collected samples will be\nused for the proposed studies in aim 1. Our specific aims are: 1. Determine Mtb specific memory-like NK cell\nresponses of children in a large group of household contacts of TB patients. 2.Compare the memory-like NK\ncell responses of HIV+ and HIV- children with LTBI. 3. Determine whether KIR haplotypes and HLA\npolymorphism is associated with expansion of memory-like NK cells in children.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Abstract\nProject Title: B-Cell Bioinformatics and Analytics for the HVTN Discovery Medicine Program\nThis proposal outlines the scientific agenda for the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) Statistical and\nData Management Center (SDMC) to expand our capacity in carrying out B-cell bioinformatics and\nanalytics work. This effort is aimed at supporting the increasing demands of the rapidly growing HVTN\nDiscovery Medicine Program which is poised to evaluate more than 15 protocols in the current HVTN\ngrant cycle.\nGiven the promising outcome of several broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb)-inducing vaccine\nimmunogens which have demonstrated initial success in eliciting tier 2 heterologous neutralization\nantibodies and expanding HIV-1 bnAb precursors, we recognize that it is strategically crucial to evaluate\nadditional vaccine candidates. These candidates should pair prime and boosting immunogens carefully\nselected to optimally mature B-cell responses towards broad neutralization against HIV. To accomplish\nthis, it is imperative to evaluate and down-select immunogens using assays that provide both cellular-\nand molecular-level information about evolution of vaccine-induced B-cell repertoires. Addressing these\nneeds necessitates the establishment of robust and standardized computational and analytical pipelines\nadapted to interrogate B-cell phenotyping (BCP) and B-cell receptor (BCR) sequencing data.\nThe HVTN SDMC has made significant progress since 2020 in developing various aspects of the\ncomputational and analytical pipeline that supports its Discovery Medicine Program. However, the\nSDMC\u2019s funding has become insufficient to meet the critical strategic requirements of the program,\nparticularly those needed to expedite the generation of reports and datasets summarizing BCP and BCR\nsequencing data to vaccine developers. These reports are critical to accelerate the design and down-\nselection of boost immunogens required to continue guiding affinity maturation of vaccine-induced B-\ncells toward neutralization against HIV. These reports are also central to quickly guiding programmatic\ndecisions from the HVTN and NIAID leaderships. This funding shortfall is primarily attributed to the\nescalating complexity of research studies, the iterative nature of immunogen designs, the increased\nnumber of studies in the pipeline, and the expectation that summaries and interpretation of these\ncomplex laboratory data should be distributed quickly. Consequently, the HVTN SDMC is seeking\nsupplemental funding for Fiscal Years (FY) 2024 through 2027 to bolster the success of the HVTN\nDiscovery Medicine Program.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Request to DAIDS to Manufacture a protein encoding CAP256.wk34.c80 OPT4 envelope for induction of\nV2 Apex bnAbs\nInduction of an effective HIV-1 vaccine is a global priority; yet, no HIV-1 vaccine regimen reproducibly elicits\nbroadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) in humans. The complex immunology underlying human bnAb\ndevelopment suggests that a successful vaccine will likely contain a series of immunogens that guide bnAb\ndevelopment 1-3. Such complex vaccines will require iterative design and evaluation in humans, necessitating\nrapid cGMP production of potent immunogens. We and others have found that multimerizing HIV-1 Env on\nnanoparticles (NPs) can augment its immunogenicity. HIV-1 Env trimer NP immunogens have been made\npreviously by encoding HIV-1 Env fused to NP subunits as a single gene. These fusion protein NPs display a\nmixture of high-quality and low-quality, misfolded HIV-1 Env on their surfaces that can elicit immunodominant\nnon-neutralizing antibodies. Thus, laborious, time-consuming development work must be performed to\noptimize the HIV-1 envelope production such that predominately well-folded envelope is fused to nanoparticle\nsubunits. Additionally, we have found during cGMP cell line development that protein yields of Env trimer NP\nmay be insufficient to enable cGMP manufacturing. The significance of this Project is that it will utilize an\nalready successful cGMP process to rapidly manufacture higher quality HIV-1 Env trimer NPs than previous\nNPs encoded by single genes. We have already utilized this technology to overcome the pitfalls incurred with\nfusion NPs, by using our innovative conjugation method that generates NPs with only well-folded HIV-1 Env on\ntheir surface. This method utilizes the high specificity of sortase A conjugation to link highly purified, well-folded\nHIV-1 Env to ferritin NPs. These sortase A-conjugated NPs (scNPs) can be assembled rapidly and preserve\nthe antigenic character of the HIV-1 Env, features critical for a vaccine regimen aiming to elicit durable,\nprotective bnAbs. This innovative, rapid NP platform is universal in nature, having been used for HIV-1 Env\ntrimers of various clades, SIVcpz Env trimers, and Spike proteins from other human pathogens such as SARS-\nCoV-2. We will utilize this platform in combination with CAP256w34.80 designed to guide affinity maturation of\nV2 Apex bnAbs in humans.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "While antiretroviral therapy (ART) can control the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and delay\ndisease progression, there is still no cure, and HIV remains a global public health challenge. A better\nunderstanding of early and persistent immunological events in HIV infection is critical to inform novel\ninterventions. The majority of current strategies aiming to prevent, control or eradicate HIV rely on harnessing\neffector functions of cytotoxic T cells, helper T cells, B cells and antibodies to attack HIV and HIV-infected cells.\nHowever, natural killer (NK) cells might represent another subset for therapeutic modulation. Recently, our lab\nhas carried out in-depth, yet preliminary research into NK cells expressing the IgA receptor, CD89, using both\nhuman and nonhuman primate samples. We have generated preliminary data showing that: (i) CD89+ NK cells\ncan be readily identified in various tissues including peripheral blood and mucosal tissues; (ii) CD89+ NK cells\ndisplay an altered signaling phenotype compared to CD89- NK cells; (iii) CD89+ NK cells are significantly\nrestricted in their activation potential; and (iv) CD89+ NK cells can be identified through multiplex imaging\nindicating their relevant proximity in the GI mucosae. Collectively these data form the basis for our overarching\nhypothesis that CD89 acts as an inhibitory checkpoint to regulate NK cell mucosal functions, and, therefore, may\nserve as an attractive target for NK cell-based interventions and therapeutics in lentivirus infections. We will test\nthis hypothesis through two focused Exploratory Aims: (i) Characterize the role(s) and functional regulation\nof CD89+ NK in the mucosae in normal and SIV/SHIV-infected macaques; and (ii) Investigate the role of\nautologous CD89+ NK cells in therapeutic modulation of SIV infection. Ultimately, this knowledge has the\npotential to inform strategies to tune CD89+ NK cells for preventive or therapeutic interventions and personalized\ntreatments, vaccine development, and strategies for reducing viral reservoirs.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Human B cells play a fundamental role in the adaptive immune response to infection, development of protective\nimmunity from vaccination, and pathology of many autoimmune diseases. Central to all of these processes are\nmigration of B cells among different tissues and differentiation of B cells into functional subtypes. Currently,\nunderstanding B cell migration and differentiation is limited because these processes are dynamic and difficult\nto directly observe, particularly in humans. Our previous work has demonstrated that it is possible to detect\nmigration and differentiation events along evolutionary trees inferred from B cell receptor (BCR) sequences,\nwhich are subject to rapid somatic hypermutation and antigen-driven selection during adaptive immune\nresponses. This is analogous to viral phylogeography, the use of evolutionary trees to track the spread of viruses\nduring epidemics. However, there are key differences in the biology of B cells and viruses that require modifying\nand extending existing approaches to make them appropriate for B cells.\n The goal of this proposal is to enable B cell phylogeography. We will develop novel computational\nmethods that leverage recent advances in single B cell sequencing technology to infer how B cells migrate\nbetween tissues and differentiate into cellular subtypes based on their activation states during immune\nresponses. The aims of this proposal focus on solving the roadblocks to the development of phylogeographic\nmethods for B cells. These methods will be validated by simulations and experimental analysis. We will work\nwith established experimental collaborators to translate these novel methods into meaningful outcomes in the\nresearch of influenza vaccine response and the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including lupus and\nmyasthenia gravis. We will implement these methods in widely available free software, which will greatly increase\ntheir potential to inform vaccination strategies against other pathogens like HIV and SARS-CoV-2, as well as\ntreatment of other B cell-mediated conditions such as multiple sclerosis and asthma.\n The K99 phase of this proposal will be guided by Prof. Steven Kleinstein at Yale School of Medicine, a\nworld leader in computational methods development for BCR sequence analysis, and Prof. Kevin O\u2019Connor, a\nleading experimental biologist in the B cell pathology of neurologic autoimmune diseases. The candidate, Dr.\nKenneth Hoehn, has a strong background in genetics and evolutionary biology, and has an established record\nof developing evolutionary models to study B cell populations from BCR sequence data. The work detailed in\nthis proposal will fill gaps in the candidate\u2019s training in B cell biology, single cell analysis, and software\ndevelopment. The R00 phase will build off of this work to develop a highly generalizable framework for\ncharacterizing the complex migration and differentiation patterns that underlie B cells\u2019 role in vaccination and\nautoimmunity. This will support new, medically-relevant discoveries about B cell biology, and serve as a\nfoundation for the candidate\u2019s future as an independent computational immunologist.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Escape of maternal plasma broadly neutralizing antibody as a mechanism of mother to child HIV transmission",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nOver 150,000 HIV-1 infants are infected via mother to child transmission (MTCT) each year, accounting for\nnearly 10% of the global annual HIV-1 infections. Even implementation of highly effective antiretroviral therapy\n(ART) cannot prevent up to 5% of HIV-1 infected women from transmitting the virus to their infants. Thus,\napproaches that synergize with ART will be needed to eliminate MTCT. The most promising interventions in\nunder clinical development to prevent HIV infection includes passive administration or active induction of\nbroadly-neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Yet, paradoxically, broad neutralization activity in maternal plasma\nhas been associated with risk of infant transmission, raising concerns about the safety of these approaches in\npregnancy. Thus, a better understanding of the role of maternal neutralizing activity and MTCT risk is needed\nto develop effective bnAb-based interventions, which together with ART can more effectively block MTCT.\nHIV MTCT is a unique transmission route that occurs in the setting of preexisting antibody raised against\nautologous viruses. We previously found that transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses in infants were more resistant\nto neutralization by paired maternal plasma than non-transmitted maternal viruses. Moreover, we established\nthat bnAb activity in maternal plasma can drive the development of circulating viral escape variants that\nbecome infant T/F viruses. We hypothesize that multispecificity of maternal plasma bnAb activity is associated\nwith reduced risk of MTCT and autologous virus escape from these functional responses by infant T/F viruses\nis a risk factor for transmission. Moreover, identifying bnAb escape variants that are fit for transmission is\nimportant to designing combination bnAb approaches that can effectively prevent virus transmission. We will\nuse the following three Specific Aims to test our hypotheses: (1) Compare the specificity and polyfunctionality\nof plasma bnAb activity from transmitting and non-transmitting mothers to assess the role of maternal bnAb\nactivity in vertical virus transmission risk. (2) Determine if infant T/F viruses and circulating viruses of\ntransmitting mothers are more resistant to plasma neutralizing activity compared to that of non-transmitted\nmaternal variants from transmitting and non-transmitting mothers. (3) Define genetic signatures responsible\nfor escape from the maternal Env-specific B cell repertoire among transmitted infant Env variants using a\npanel of native Env trimer-specific mAbs isolated from transmitting mothers. Defining the specificity and\nfunction of pre-existing maternal neutralizing antibodies that can reduce virus escape and impede\ntransmission will be critical to design novel passive and active vaccine approaches that can eliminate HIV\ntransmission from mothers to infants, and is a tool to define the population impact of the future use of bnAb-\nbased prophylaxis on HIV transmission dynamics.",

In this proposal, we will leverage our existing\nfacilities and in-house expertise in each of the following imaging modalities and their integration\ninto a correlated sample preparation workflow: cryoFLM, cryoFIB, and cryoET. We will establish\nall the necessary equipment dedicated to the proposed service and training activities. We will\nprepare video curriculum materials to train new users in the aforementioned protocols. We will\nadapt our existing infrastructure to manage project administration and resource allocations.\nAdministrative support is in place to help users with lodging arrangements, as well as laboratory\non-boarding and specimen biosafety approvals. We have a well set- up communication\ninfrastructure for remote users to participate in actual experiments, particularly for cryoFLM,\ncryoFIB, and cryoET. We will provide access to existing Titan Krios microscopes to evaluate\nwhether the prepared samples are ready for data collection in the associated Hub, which will\nbe set up at another institution with separate NIH support. We will make our existing Stanford-\nSLAC cryo-specimen preparation equipment available on a limited basis immediately after this\nproposal is funded. We anticipate serving ~40 users per year once the Center is fully\noperational in early Year 2 of the award period. We will also offer regular hands- on workshops\nto train ~10-12 new users per year. We will disseminate our resources to the broad community\nvia a web portal and booths at professional societies\u2019 annual conferences. The number of users\nwill increase in subsequent years as we and our recurring users optimize the use of the Center\u2019s\nresources. In Years 3-6, we will work closely with collaborators pioneering advanced protocols\nsuch as semi-automated and automated cryoFIB and \u201clift-out\u201d for tissue samples to implement\nthem in the proposed Center. Lastly, we will assemble a Scientific Advisory Committee of\nexperts to guide the practices of our Service Center and the ongoing implementation of cutting-\nedge technologies.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nThe objective of this proposal is to optimize and validate the hemostatic bioadhesive paste in compliance with\nFDA regulatory guidance for the FDA IDE approval in advance of the future pivotal clinical trial and ultimate\nregulatory clearance and commercialization. In light of the huge and rapidly growing clinical and economic costs\nof major hemorrhagic events in cardiovascular and other surgeries, various hemostatic agents have been\ndeveloped and clinically tested. To date, however, there is no hemostatic solution that can achieve effective and\nrapid hemostasis in frequent and high-risk bleeding of patients under anticoagulation or coagulopathic settings\ndue to the incompatibility of conventional coagulation-based hemostatic approaches. To address these\nlimitations of existing solutions, during the prior development (Phase I-equivalent), our collaborative team\ndeveloped a proof-of-concept prototype of a hemostatic bioadhesive paste for rapid (within 10 s) coagulation-\nindependent control of bleedings by uniquely utilizing the novel blood-resistant bioadhesive mechanism. The\npreliminary pre-clinical validation and analysis based on in vivo rat and porcine models demonstrated the\npromising hemostatic efficacy and underlying mechanism of the hemostatic bioadhesive paste for the\nbioadhesion-based coagulation-independent rapid control of bleedings. Building upon the promising outcome of\nthe prior development, under the scope of this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR proposal, we will further optimize and\nvalidate the hemostatic bioadhesive paste in compliance with relevant FDA regulatory guidance for the highly\neffective and broadly affordable solution to treat high-risk bleeding in the anticoagulated or coagulopathic\npatients. If successful, the proposed project will allow SanaHeal to prepare and submit the FDA IDE package in\nadvance to a pivotal clinical trial and ultimate commercialization with far-reaching benefits for patients and the\nhealthcare system.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nCell division underlies the development of humans from embryos to full-grown adults, regenerative processes\nsuch as wound healing, and diseases such as cancer. While much is known about the intracellular aspects of\nmammalian cell division, less is known about the extracellular aspects of cell division. In many physiological\ncontexts, cells divide in mechanically confining microenvironments, including dense extracellular matrices\n(ECMs) and growing tumors. Cell division requires extensive morphological changes, including significant growth\nduring the G1 phase of the cell cycle and elongation along the mitotic axis during mitosis, or mitotic elongation.\nBoth growth and mitotic elongation are strictly required for successful cell division. A mechanically confining\nmicroenvironment provides a physical barrier to both cell growth and mitotic elongation, and cells must overcome\nthis confinement for successful cell division. Our recent studies have shown that single dividing cells in three-\ndimensional (3D) matrices generate protrusive forces along the mitotic axis to drive mitotic elongation via a\ncombination of interpolar spindle elongation and cytokinetic ring contraction. We have also found that cell growth\nduring the G1 phase is mediated by outward force generation. However, it remains unclear how these forces\nand their underlying mechanisms adapt to confining microenvironments with a wide range of stiffness and\nviscoelasticity. In this project, we will determine how cells tune extracellular forces to sustain cell division in highly\nconfining microenvironments, using a powerful combination of rigorous agent-based modeling and experiments\nwith engineered biomaterials for 3D cell culture. We hypothesize that in microenvironments with increased\nconfinement, i) protrusive activity increases to make space and activate mechanosensitive channels for driving\nG1 phase cell growth via increased osmotic pressure, and ii) enhanced cytokinetic ring contraction drives mitotic\nelongation. The main hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following three aims: (1) Determine how mitotic\nelongation of isolated cells within highly confining microenvironments is accomplished via a novel force feedback\nmechanism; (2) Define how isolated cells achieve G1 phase cell growth in highly confining microenvironments;\nand (3) Establish how growth and mitotic elongation of cells in growing spheroids induce overall expansion of\nspheroids in highly confining microenvironments. The proposed research project is significant because it will\nreveal how cells modulate their force generation, to drive cell growth and mitotic elongation for cell division in\nphysiologically relevant microenvironments, and also elucidate the role of matrix remodeling and multicellular\ncooperation in cell division. The approach is innovative because of i) the development and use of agent-based\nmodels that can rigorously capture the most important aspects of cell growth, mitotic elongation, and confining\nmicroenvironments with complex rheological properties, ii) the focus on extracellular aspects of cell division, iii)\nthe role of matrix viscoelasticity in cell division, and iv) the examination of the physical basis for spheroid growth.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Astrocyte border formation involving proliferative reactive changes in local astrocytes is a conserved feature of\nmany CNS disorders including neurotraumatic, neurodegenerative, neuroinflammatory, and neoplastic\ndiseases. Across disorders, astrocyte borders form against a non-neural niche compartment, containing\nstromal and peripherally derived myeloid cells, whose cellular composition varies across disorders and stages\nof disease. Despite targeted loss of function studies revealing the neuroprotective roles of astrocyte borders,\nthe context-specific functions of astrocyte borders at different non-neural niches are still poorly understood.\nThe development of new tools and techniques to dissect the complex biology at astrocyte borders in a\nsimplified, focal, and reproducible model system is needed to address important knowledge gaps. Injecting\nbiomaterials into mouse brain promotes spatiotemporally controlled astrocyte border formation and we see an\nopportunity to use biomaterials to generate a new bioassay to study astrocyte borders. The main objective of\nthis project is to advance a new bioassay to stimulate and characterize astrocyte borders and use this\nbioassay to profile several different functional states of astrocyte borders conferred by interactions with diverse\nnon-neural cell populations. Our overall hypothesis is that by locally injecting cellulose-based biomaterials with\ndifferent physiochemical properties into the mouse striatum we will stimulate distinct non-neural niches that will\nconfer temporal- and biomaterial-dependent changes in astrocyte states during the transition into astrocyte\nborders which we can profile. In aim 1, we will optimize the bioassay to study astrocyte borders by combining\ninjectable, non-resorbable methyl cellulose hydrogels with viral vectors (AAVs) enabling astrocyte specific\nexpression of RiboTag. At 7, 14, 28, and 70 days after hydrogel injection into the mouse striatum, mRNA from\nthe formed astrocyte borders will be recovered by RiboTag immunoprecipitation and processed by RNA-Seq.\nCohorts of mice taken at the same timepoints will be processed by IHC to visualize changes in astrocyte\nmorphology, ribosome trafficking, and multicellular interactions. To validate capacity to detect altered astrocyte\nborder states we will disrupt astrocyte border formation by controlled release of molecular inhibitors. In aim 2,\nwe will evaluate astrocyte border states at non-neural niches with different immune cell compositions that will\nbe created by chemically modifying cellulose-based hydrogels to display non-fouling, immunosuppressive, or\nimmunostimulatory functional groups as well as through local delivery of small molecule immunoregulators\nfrom hydrogels. Through this project, we will make important technical innovations to develop a new bioassay\nthat will allow us to identify conserved- and context-dependent mechanisms involved in astrocyte border\nformation and function. This work will provide the foundations on which to explore therapeutic targeting of\nastrocyte borders to direct CNS disorder outcomes and improve medical device biocompatibility in future work.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "1 Abstract \u2013 More than 500,000 surgical procedures are performed annually in the United States to address\n 2 peripheral nerve injuries at a cost of more than $1.1B. Fewer than 50% of patients report satisfactory functional\n 3 recovery following nerve injury repair procedures, likely due to slow axonal regrowth and difficulty in bridging\n 4 across the sites of injury due to inflammation, scarring, and axonal misdirection. Poor recovery from nerve injuries\n 5 leads to significant impacts on patient quality of life. For example, motor and/or sensory impairment from nerve\n 6 injuries can prevent patients from performing basic daily activities, can be accompanied by chronic pain, and\n 7 result in severe psychosocial impacts. Injuries to proximal segments and gaps > 1 cm are challenging and have\n 8 inconsistent outcomes, while gaps larger than 3 cm seldom achieve any meaningful recovery. A number of\n 9 products used for nerve gap injury repair such as conduits and allografts exist; however, none has shown\n10 compelling clinical improvements in functional outcomes, particularly when compared to the \u201cgold standard\u201d\n11 autograft. Renerva has developed Peripheral Nerve Matrix (PNM), a tissue-based hydrogel derived from porcine\n12 nerve that can be used as a nerve conduit filler for the purpose of improving functional outcomes following the\n13 repair of challenging gap injuries. PNM has been shown to modulate key early events in the nerve regeneration\n14 process including macrophage recruitment, macrophage polarization towards a pro-regenerative/angiogenic\n15 phenotype, and Schwann cell recruitment. In a sub-critical (0.8 cm) rodent nerve gap injury model, silicone\n16 conduits filled with PNM were shown to increase axon extension (10x empty conduit control) and improve\n17 functional recovery (compound motor action potential; 2x control), which was equivalent to the improvements\n18 obtained using control autografts. While promising, PNM has yet to be tested in critical nerve gap defect models,\n19 and additional optimization of the PNM formulation could yield results exceeding the performance of nerve\n20 autografts. In this Phase I project, Renerva will optimize the PNM formulation (gel concentration and residual\n21 chondroitin sulfate content) and mechanical properties (rheologic and compressive modulus) with the goal to\n22 exceed the performance of the gold-standard nerve autograft in a rat critical nerve gap injury model (1.5 cm). An\n23 established suite of longitudinal motor and sensory endpoints will be employed over a period of 12 weeks to\n24 assess in vivo recovery. Electrophysiologic function as well as multiple histologic and immuno-labeling endpoints\n25 will be performed at termination. Renerva will further test the shelf stability of the optimized PNM formulation via\n26 in vitro and in vivo studies. The proposed objectives address critical requirements for regulatory and future clinical\n27 use of PNM, and will critically de-risk PNM to enable Phase II of this project. Phase II will determine the optimized\n28 PNM's ability to promote recovery in clinically relevant large gap injuries (>3 cm) in a large animal model and\n29 support the completion of the safety tests required for commercializing the optimized PNM product. This project\n30 will advance the field and allow clinicians to offer an effective product for critical size nerve gap injuries.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Lysosomal Regeneration (LysoGen) and Rescue as a Treatment for Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nThis proposal describes a novel concept for acidification of the lysosome and, subsequently, restoration of au-\ntophagic flux. Autophagy, the intracellular process by which proteins and organelles are degraded, requires an\nacidic lysosome. Failure to acidify the lysosomal compartment leads to accumulation of autophagosomes, lipids,\nand associated undigested content. Impaired lysosomal acidification and reduced autophagic flux are central to\nnon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hereafter referred to by its new nomenclature, metabolic-dysfunction\nassociated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). The risk factors for developing MASLD increase with advancing age\nand, therefore, not surprisingly, MASLD occurs primarily among the middle-aged and the elderly. Current phar-\nmacological interventions do not target the liver directly to treat MASLD and, instead, affect secondary pathways\nor mechanisms (e.g., GLP-1 receptor agonists to decrease food intake). Key to our advance is the engineering\nof a treatment that responds to the pH of a dysfunctional lysosome (pH 5.7 - 6) to release acid and, therein,\nfurther lower the pH to a healthy/normal value (pH 4 - 5). This acid-activated therapy, which we call LysoGen\n(short for \u201clysosomal regeneration\u201d) is composed of polyester-based co-polymers comprising a potent diacid,\ntetrafluorosuccinic acid (TFSA). We hypothesize that, upon accumulation in liver lysosomes after intrave-\nnous administration, LysoGen will release acid, thereby restoring lysosomal acidity and autophagic flux,\nas well as rescuing functional and histological hallmarks of MASLD, such as improved glucose/insulin\ntolerance and reduced lipid droplet accumulation in the liver. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the ex-\ntent of restoration will depend on the LysoGen polymer composition and dosing regimen. Importantly,\nsubstantial preliminary data support the proposed studies, well-characterized materials and rigorous experi-\nmental designs are established, and essential cross-disciplinary collaborations and expertise (polymer chemis-\ntry, biomaterials, cell metabolism, autophagy, and MASLD) are in place to address these hypotheses. LysoGen\nprovides an unprecedented opportunity to treat MASLD with a first-of-its-kind therapy. Herein, we seek to in-\ncrease our understanding of this new technology and its impact on the biology and pathology of the MASLD\ndisease state as well as elucidate and optimize this approach as a prelude to future clinical translation. The\nspecific aims of this five-year proposal include: Aim 1. Synthesize and characterize LysoGen polymers that\nactivate at pH 6 and are targeted to lysosomes; Aim 2. Determine the in vitro bioavailability and resulting bioac-\ntivity of LysoGen; and, Aim 3. Evaluate the toxicity, biodistribution and efficacy of the optimized LysoGen formu-\nlation in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced MASLD mouse model.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\n Retinal degenerative diseases are the leading cause of irreversible vision loss. Current retina prosthesis are\nsolid state implantable devices designed to stimulate sensation of vision in the eyes of individuals with these\nsignificant conditions. Resolution and pixel density are limited in the existing devices. In addition, these solid-\nstate implants require invasive surgical incision and have risks and challenges post-op. New technologies and\nmethods are still being sought for minimally invasive prostheses for precise and non-genetic retina stimulation.\nIn this Trailblazer application, we propose an injectable optoacoustic retina prosthesis for high precision retina\nstimulation. The injectable prosthesis is a soft biocompatible optoacoustic material which can be injected in\ntargeted areas in retina. Coupled with patterned illumination via a scanning strategy, the injectable retina\nprostheses are expected to achieve retinal stimulation with a spatial resolution of 40-50 \u00b5m. Such unprecedent\ninjection strategy, ultra-high spatial precision, and potential of massive parallel capabilities, together with the soft\nand biocompatible design, offer clear advantages. A multi-disciplinary team with complementary expertise is\nassembled to perform the proposed activities. Prof. Chen Yang (PI) is an expert in nanomaterials and neural\ndevices and interfaces for modulation and regeneration. Prof. Serge Picaud (Co-I, Institut de la Vision, France)\nhas 30 years research experience in retina and vision. Our team has pioneered ultra-high precision optoacoustic\nneuromodulation. We have successfully shown the retina can be directly stimulated by optoacoustic. Our central\nhypothesis that via the design of the injectable optoacoustic retina prostheses, we will achieve minimally invasive\nretina stimulation at an unprecedented 50 micro-meter spatial precision. To test this central hypothesis, the\nfollowing specific aims are proposed. In Aim 1 and 2, we will develop a highly efficient photoacoustic injectable\nbiomaterial and demonstrate high precision retinal stimulation at micrometer-scale resolution by multi-electrode\narray recording of retinal tissues. In Aim 3, we will Evaluate the safety and efficacy of stimulation by injectable\noptoacoustic prostheses in rodent models. These efforts are expected to generate a conceptually new injectable\nprosthesis design offering massively parallel, high precision and genetics-free optoacoustic stimulation with\ntranslational potential to human.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "NINDS Application Abstract\nPluripotent stem cells were originally isolated from embryos but their utility as tools for research and therapeutic\ndevelopment was severely restricted due to ethical considerations as well as the inability to derive stem cells\nfrom subjects with known disorders. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) generated from adult somatic\ncells were first described in 2007. Since then, hiPSCs have been established from subjects with specific\ndisorders (many with known genotypes) and then differentiated to relevant cell types such as neurons for central\nnervous system disorders. Using these hiPSC we can create \u201cdisease models in a dish\u201d that can model cell\ndevelopment and disease progression and be used for drug screening and for toxicology testing. However,\nhuman genetic diversity has hampered the usefulness of individual hiPSC for disease modeling. Controls often\nconsist of age and sex-matched non-affected family members or other subjects. The CRISPR (clustered\nregularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas system can now generate isogenic hiPSC that will serve\nas better controls and help eliminate effects that are due to genetic background, thus providing a better\nunderstanding of mechanisms of human disease and development.\n The NINDS Human Cell and Data Repository (NHCDR) was established to collect, derive and distribute\nhuman cells such as skin fibroblasts and blood cells and convert these to iPSCs for research on\nneurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease,\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Dystonia and Frontotemporal Degeneration. Since 1998, RUCDR Infinite\nBiologics\u00ae (RUCDR) has provided the NIH, private foundations and the global scientific community with the\nhighest quality biomaterials, technical consultation, and logistical support for human genetics research. In 2011,\nRUCDR began providing its stem cell services to the NIH, including source cell and iPSC banking; iPSC\ngeneration; iPSC gene editing; and source cell and iPSC distribution. In 2015, RUCDR successfully competed\nfor the NHCDR and in the past 5 years the catalog has grown to contain 268 FCL lines from 256 subjects and\n259 iPSC lines from 132 subjects, including the addition of 7 isogenic pairs of iPSC. During this time RUCDR\nshipped 458 orders for 1538 cell lines to investigators around the world. The continuing mission of the NHCDR\nis to work with NINDS investigators and staff on all aspects of study management to collect, process and\ndistribute the highest quality cell lines from human subjects. This effort includes the culturing of fibroblasts from\nskin biopsies, the isolation of lymphocytes from blood, and the derivation of iPSC lines from both cell types.\nRUCDR will continue to provide a comprehensive range of quality testing of iPSCs to ensure they conform to\nthe highest standards. If requested, we will also provide additional services to the global community, including\nthe generation of neural stem cells (NSCs) and different types of neurons. RUCDR will continue to exhibit\nscientific flexibility to grow and adapt to leading best practices in the stem cell field.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Overall Summary/Abstract\nThe overall goal of this proposal is to continue to provide an integrated, efficient synchrotron structural biology\nResource to the research community. This Resource, called ALS-ENABLE, is located at the Advanced Light\nSource (ALS) in Berkeley, California. The team has two decades of experience operating macromolecular X-ray\ncrystallography (MX) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) beamlines, and more recently, an X-ray\nfootprinting mass spectrometry (XFMS) beamline. The team has worked closely together over the last 4 years\nto create the ALS-ENABLE Resource, and many of the team members are cross-trained in the three X-ray\nstructural biology methods. During the 4 years we have implemented a transparent interface to the ALS structural\nbiology resources, and helped users pursue successful structure determination for both routine and challenging\nproblems. We have worked with a diverse user community, ranging from experts to new synchrotron users with\nlimited training in structural biology techniques. Where necessary we have guided users through the most\nappropriate routes for answering their biological question. In this renewal application we propose to make several\nchanges to the Resource in response to recent changes in the field of structural biology, leverage a new high-\nperformance beamline (GEMINI), and incorporate the now mature synchrotron technique of X-ray footprinting\n(XFMS).",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Summary\nThere is a global need to prioritize the development of a novel dental restoration that meets the criteria of being\nlong-lasting, easy to use, and accessible without complicated equipment. We aim to revolutionize dental care by\ndeveloping a cutting-edge platform for the rapid and precise creation of dental restoration materials. Our vision\nis to tailor these materials to individual needs, adapting to the unique conditions of patients' oral environments.\nOur innovative restorative system will include self-strengthening adhesives, bioactive fillers that respond to\nbiological signals, durable resins, and additives that provide new functions. Designed to be adaptable, this new\nclass of dental materials will be able to repair microcracks autonomously and prevent cariogenic biofilm.\nMoreover, the easily applicable and durable restorative system will advance digital dentistry to a new level. Our\nnew approach integrates a physics-based model of testing and data-based simulations into the workflow of\nmaterial design and evaluation, this will drastically expedite the traditionally slow and costly route of material\ndevelopment. Our ultimate goal is to introduce a novel operational platform in restorative dentistry, along with a\nsuite of multifunctional materials tailored for various dental treatments. Our diverse team, with expertise spanning\nmaterials science, engineering, dentistry, and computational modeling, is committed to achieving this through a\nthree-pronged strategic approach. Aim 1 is to create a self-improving dental adhesive that enhances its bond\nwith the tooth substrate by facilitating mineralization at the interface. This auto-enhancing universal dental\nadhesive (AUDA) will fill gaps between the tooth and adhesive, offering better adhesion than current products.\nWe will expedite AUDA development using hybrid modeling and simulation approaches (HMSA), which\nincorporate data-driven multi-physics simulation techniques and create a virtual twin of the physical testing\nenvironment. The performance of AUDA will undergo rigorous validation, including tests for bond strength to\nextracted human teeth and durability under various challenges simulating human oral environments. Aim 2\nfocuses on crafting bioactive dental composites with self-healing and antimicrobial properties, achieved by\nintegrating innovative nanofillers. These composites that are designed to be compatible with existing dental\nadhesives and AUDA will be validated for mechanical strength, bacterial inhibition, healing efficiency, and fatigue\nlife improvement. Aim 3 is to produce CAD/CAM restoratives optimized for digital dentistry, offering robust,\nbiocompatible materials with excellent aesthetics and bonding strength to teeth. Ultimately, our integration of\nartificial intelligence and a virtual lab with the material development process in the physical lab will revolutionize\nand individualize dental care. This platform will provide materials precisely tailored to meet diverse patient needs.\nSuccessful completion of these Aims will generate a battery of novel bioactive multifunctional restorative\nmaterials for precision placement and patients' needs. Its success will redefine dental restorative materials,\nushering in an era of personalized caries treatment.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nMore than 500,000 Americans are living with end-stage kidney disease, and most of them require life-\nsustaining hemodialysis treatments three times a week. Despite major improvements over the past several\ndecades, the average life expectancy for dialysis patients is still only 5-10 years. Moreover, the financial burden\nis significant: dialysis patients comprise about 1% of those on Medicare, yet their care accounts for over 7% of\nthe Medicare budget. There is a pressing need to improve both patient outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of\nhemodialysis treatment; the single most important problem facing patients being treated with hemodialysis is\nsafe and reliable cannulation. To address these challenges, we developed an implantable device that aims to\nimprove vascular access. The device features a 3D-printed titanium shell that accurately guides the hemodialysis\nneedle to the correct insertion point, while a titanium-nitride coated valve stops bleeding immediately upon\nneedle removal. This new cutting-edge device minimizes the risks for infection, incorrect needle placement, and\nexcessive bleeding, making hemodialysis treatments safer, more efficient, and easier to administer. In this phase-\nI SBIR proposal, we will use state-of-the-art materials and engineering techniques to refine the manufacturability\nand operational parameters of our device. Then through a large animal preclinical study, we will evaluate device\nfunctionality, tissue integration, inflammatory profile as well as infection and bleeding risks. Our results will pave\nthe way for a comprehensive large-scale GLP-certified animal study and a first-in-human trial. Our device has\nthe potential to be a disruptive technology in nephrology, improve the quality of life for dialysis patients, and\npossibly facilitate wider adoption of home-based hemodialysis treatments.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Recapitulating the native tendon microenvironment through design of degradable, anisotropic engineered extracellular matrices",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nFollowing injury and repair, tendons rarely exhibit full restoration of function and reinjuries are prominent. Poor\nclinical outcomes are due to deposition of disorganized scar tissue rather than tissue with the anisotropic,\nhierarchical structure as in uninjured tendon. Prior work has demonstrated that anisotropic materials as\nscaffolds to guide cells promote expression of tenogenic markers and provide a template for cell orientation,\nshowing promise for promoting regenerative healing. However, biomaterials used in these studies lack\ntunability in biophysical and biochemical cues critical for fully recapitulating the native tendon environment in\nan engineered extracellular matrix (eECM) and translation of the eECM to in vivo applications. To address\nthese limitations, we have developed a novel approach to fabricate anisotropic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)\nhydrogel-based eECM to promote the alignment of human tenocytes. These anisotropic hydrogels are formed\nusing a two-stage polymerization that eliminates complications of using additives or complex processing\ntechniques to introduce anisotropy and enables scaling of the biomaterial without compromising material\nproperties. In the first stage, a network is formed via a Michael-addition reaction of 4-arm PEG-maleimide and\ndicysteine peptides. The network is strained to introduce anisotropy, followed by a secondary thiol-ene\nphotocrosslinking of remaining peptide thiols and 8-arm PEG-norbornene to retain strain-induced alignment.\nNotably, the eECM includes MMP-degradable crosslinks to balance structural cues and matrix remodeling. We\npropose herein that hydrogel-mediated anisotropic guidance and biochemical cues to tenocytes in balance with\nhydrogel remodeling will orchestrate native-like tendon deposition. In Aim 1, material properties of anisotropic\neECM will be characterized. Mechanical properties will be tested via tensile testing parallel and perpendicular\nto alignment. Temporal retention of alignment as a function of MMP-mediated degradation will be analyzed via\nwide angle x-ray diffraction. Human tenocytes will be seeded in the eECM and cell and matrix anisotropy will\nbe analyzed using microscopy. Matrix deposition will be analyzed by comparing ratios and organization of type\nI to type III collagen deposition and gene expression of scleraxis, tenomodulin, mohawk, and \u237aSMA as\nmeasures of regenerative versus fibrotic characteristics. Isotropic hydrogels will be used as controls with\nanalysis over 14 days in vitro. In Aim 2, tenocyte gene expression profiles induced by anisotropic, degradable\nPEG hydrogel-based eECM will be comprehensively analyzed via RNAseq. Differential gene expression will be\nassessed on day 14 samples to compare gene profiles between eECM groups and freshly isolated cells from\nhealthy and fibrotic tendons. Completing these aims will provide insight into materials design parameters for\neECM to develop a pro-regenerative environment for tenocytes. The hydrogels are expected to promote\nalignment and suppress fibrosis, providing a platform for translating eECM as an effective 3D scaffold in\ntendon repair and other aligned musculoskeletal tissues such as muscle.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Investigation of cold plasma for healing alcohol-induced tissue injury",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract:\n Binge drinking of alcohol beverages hinders tissue repair and amplifies the susceptibility to infection. The\nprevalence as well as the risks associated with binge drinking poses a significant concern in the United States.\nBinge drinking impairs the three key phases of wound healing: inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling.\nSpecifically, during the inflammation phase, binge drinking diminishes the function of pro-inflammatory cytokines,\nneutrophils, and macrophages, thus compromising the innate immune system's ability to combat pathogens. The\nefficacy of current wound healing methods is constrained by the vulnerability to wound infection which is\nexacerbated by concurrent binge drinking. Cold Plasma (CP) has recently gained substantial attention in clinical\npractice due to its regenerative properties and its ability to prevent infection. Previous studies have shown that\nCP treatment is involved in the wound healing mediated by the Nrf2 pathway and Wnt/\u03b2\u2011catenin signaling\npathway.\n Taken these solid premises together, we hypothesize that CP will improve impaired wound healing and\nmitigate the increased vulnerability to infection caused by binge drinking. To substantiate these hypotheses, we\nhave proposed two following specific aims using F344 rat model and human skin organoid model, respectively.\nAim 1 is to characterize wound healing properties of CP in F344 rats following binge exposure to alcohol.\nThis aim is to examine wound closure properties of CP and to reveal molecular mechanisms underlying CP\nmodulation of wound healing in binge EtOH intoxicated F344 rats. Aim 2 is to generate an in-vitro wound\nhealing model using hiPSC derived skin organoids and to investigate the potential wound healing\nproperties of CP in these skin organoids given binge level of EtOH. This aim represents the translational\naspect of our studies. We first will develop and characterize 3D skin organoids using human induced pluripotent\nstem cells (hiPSC) and then identify the potential wound healing properties of CP in alcohol-treated human skin\norganoids. In addition, we will study molecular mechanisms and signal pathways underlying CP modulation of\nwound healing in alcohol treated skin organoids using both immunofluorescence and gene expression analysis.\n These studies are highly significant because 1) we are to demonstrate the medical use of CP in wound healing\nassociated with EtOH intoxication, and 2) we are to address the translational value of the proposed studies using\nF344 rat model and human culture of skin organoids. Successful completion of this small R03 grant award will\nprovide valuable therapeutic clues in CP modulation of the wound healing during EtOH intoxication. The study\noutcomes shall shift the paradigms regarding the interplay between wound healing properties of CP and alcohol-\ninduced impairment of wound healing, eventually leading to clinical application of CP in wound healing during\nEtOH intoxication. We expect a full R01 project to be developed in conclusion of this small R03 project.",

Yet progress in\nimmunotherapies for solid tumors is well behind those for lymphoma. CAR-T cell therapies and\nengineered T cells have become revolutionary approaches for hematopoietic cancers, but their\npotential for solid tumors is yet to be realized. Significant challenges hinder the potential of\nimmune therapies in solid tumors, including insufficient activation and eventual exhaustion of\neffector T cells; and suppression of T cell effector responses in the tumor microenvironment. In\nthis proposal we consider these hurdles and offer a biomaterial solution that overcomes them.\nThis proposal is significant in facilitating endogenous T cells to fight solid tumors. Surgery is a\nmajor treatment modality for both invasive and in situ tumors, but at this time, there are no specific\nimmunotherapies initiated at the time of surgery; they all start days to weeks later. Our proposal\nis significant for offering a way to start treatments early, right at the time of initial surgery. Here\nour synthetic scaffold, SymphNode can be injected at the time of biopsy or surgery not to only\nrecruit and active tumor-experienced local immune cells but also to suppress the inhibitory cells\ncreated by tumor cells. Our long-term goal is to develop this bioengineered, locally injected,\n\u201csynthetic lymph node\u201d into a therapy for human tumors.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nThis K23 application is to support the research and career development of Dr. Dayane Oliveira by providing her\nwith an intensive mentored experience in order for her to complete the transition to an independent clinician-\nscientist with a patient-centered research program focused on an unexplored area of designing and\nimplementing novel dental biomaterials using red light in their application. Light-cured materials revolutionized\ndentistry as they allowed to control the setting of the materials in a timely manner simply upon light exposure.\nThe use of light-cured materials in dentistry was made possible by adding photoinitiators to the composition of\ndental materials. Although blue light has been routinely used to cure dental restorative materials for over 50\nyears, there are still potential risks to dental patients. These risks include gingiva burn/recession and pulp\ninflammation that can lead to necrosis in more severe situations caused/induced by the heat generated by this\nshort wavelength. As well as the direct effects on the gingival and pulpal cells, including the induction of\nirreversible reactive oxygen species levels imbalance, damage to the mitochondrial DNA, and collagen\ndegradation. On the other hand, long wavelengths (such as red light) are known to induce less heat and have\nopposing effects on cellular function, reducing inflammation and increasing cell proliferation. Although the blue-\nlight hazards in dentistry are well known, little can be done as to date as there were no photoinitiators capable\nof absorbing longer wavelengths. Our group has overcome this hurdle by synthesizing a dental photoinitiator\nactivated by red light, thus opening the door for red light to be used in restorative dental procedures. Our in vitro\npreliminary data demonstrate the positive effects of red light on temperature during the curing process as well\nas on fibroblast and odontoblast viability and their initial signaling responses. Thus, as the next step in filling this\nclinical need, we here propose to conduct an exploratory Phase 1 medical device study combined with a\nfurther ex vivo mechanistic study as the next logical steps in translating this improved clinical care from\nlaboratory findings to clinical practice. Our central hypothesis is that longer wavelengths will mitigate pulpal\nand gingival damage during dental restorative procedures. The results of this work will lay the groundwork to\nsupport a future medical device Phase 2 study application in order to achieve the long-term goal of using red\nlight as a new strategy for light-curing in Dentistry. Thus, ensuring a safer and more effective treatment strategy\nto improve oral health. Dr. Oliveira has established a multi-disciplinary mentoring team to provide expertise in\ntranslational research training and mentorship in her career development. A training plan including didactic,\nhands-on, and career development experiences has been put forth to enable this transition together with this\nstrong research plan.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe long-term goal of this project is to develop a scalable, user-friendly, continuous glucose monitoring\n(CGM) system for better diabetes management. IMS has developed the world's smallest\nelectrochemical analyte sensing platform based on an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)\nusing Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology. This design offers some unique\nadvantages due to its active digital sensor (compared to passive analog sensors in current leading\nCGMs) including extreme miniaturization, on-chip integration of multiple sensors and processing\nelectronics, improvement in signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio (thus improving hypoglycemia accuracy), and\non-chip temperature calibration (improve accuracy, reliability by confirming the sensor is in the tissue,\nand performing on-site temperature calibration during sickness, exercise, and sleep). Moreover, the\nsystem uses extremely scalable semiconductor and flexible electronics manufacturing methods,\nincreasing lot sizes by > 50,000x (simplifying factory calibration) and reducing cost (improving\naffordability and broadening usage). The proposed system is named CGM+ since it goes beyond just\nglucose monitoring (v1 measures glucose and temperature, v2 will measure glucose, ketones,\ntemperature, and pH). Hence, the design is highly innovative.\nWe have demonstrated the function of the CGM+ platform in humans in a First-In-Human (FIH)\nfeasibility study in Phase II. Recently, we verified the feasibility of system operation for 14 days in a\nsecond human study (ongoing).\nOur objective in this CRP grant is to optimize the manufacturing and the quality framework to enable\nlarger human studies, paving the way towards enabling an FDA IDE for approval trials.\nThis work is significant as it will catalyze the commercialization of the first CGM+ system capable of\nthe smallest needle insertion (28-gauge needle) that can work for a long time (>14 days) with factory\ncalibration (no finger sticks). After the first approval, this system can be extended to include other\nanalytes (e.g., ketones, insulin, glucagon) without increasing its size, owing to the on-chip integration\nof multiple sensors.\nThe team includes original inventors of the core technology from the California Institute of Technology\n(Dr. Nazari, Dr. Rahman, Mr. Sencan), a seasoned and respected researcher in electrochemical sensor\ntechnology (Bill Van Antwerp, former CSO of Medtronic MiniMed), regulatory and IP expert (John\nHeithaus, JD), commercialization expert (Mr. Paul Strasma, former CEO of Capillary Biomedical which\nwas recently acquired by Tandem Diabetes), clinical expert (Dr. Alan Marcus, MD; former Chief Medical\nOfficer of Medtronic Diabetes), and a biosensors and biomaterials expert (Dr. Natalie Wisniewski, Ph.D.,\nformer CTO of Profusa, Inc.).",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nPremature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is characterized by a decline in ovarian function resulting in infertility and\nreduced ovarian hormone production. Globally, the rate of POI is approximately 3.5% resulting in\n~138,250,000 women experiencing subfertility or infertility. Consequently, fertility preservation and restoration\nare a priority among patients with POI and individuals who desire children later in their reproductive lifespan.\nHowever, many limitations to the current fertility preservation and restoration options result in short hormonal\nfunctionality of transplanted ovarian tissue, low live birth rates, and low numbers of good-quality oocytes for in\nvitro maturation. Therefore, the development of novel technologies and methodologies for the advancement of\nreproductive science is imperative. Our main goal through this work is to elucidate matrisome-dependent\nmechanisms that contribute to folliculogenesis while also designing a defined biomaterial that improves follicle\ngrowth and oocyte quality in vitro. We will accomplish this through the interrogation of Elastin Microfibril\nInterface-located protein 1\u2019s (EMILIN1) role in folliculogenesis (Aim 1) and by engineering a biomaterial that\nincreases follicle growth and oocyte quality (Aim 2). Our preliminary studies demonstrate our ability to\ninvestigate matrisome-dependent cues in vitro using decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) hydrogels\nderived from bovine ovarian tissue. We have shown that hydrogels with a high quantity of EMILIN1 increase\nmurine follicle diameter in vitro compared to hydrogels with a low quantity of EMILIN1. This effect can be\nrescued with the addition of rhEMILIN1. Importantly, this effect can only be observed when follicles are cultured\nin dECM and EMILIN1 had no effect on growth when added to a biologically inert hydrogel, alginate. Therefore,\nwe will elucidate the mechanism by which EMILIN1 increases follicle growth by performing bulk-RNA\nsequencing on murine follicles grown in the presence or absence of EMILIN1 in dECM and interrogating the\nsignaling pathways associated with EMILIN1. Then, we will engineer a hydrogel of defined matrisome\ncomposition to recapitulate the follicle growth dynamics observed in dECM hydrogels with an abundance of\nEMILIN1. To do this, we will perform a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and subsequent unbiased proteomics to\ndefine matrisome proteins that EMILIN1 associates with. We will then use this list of proteins to design an ECM\nhydrogel for ovarian follicle culture that increases follicle growth and oocyte quality via an EMILIN1-driven\nmechanism. Taken together, these aims will expand our understanding of the role of EMILIN1 in\nfolliculogenesis, advise future work in designing advanced biomaterials for follicle culture, and lead to future\nfertility preservation and restoration options. Finally, this research will be influential to the greater scientific\ncommunity by expanding our technical repertoire for studying matrisome-dependent biochemical cues within\nother organ systems.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nCardiovascular disease, primarily driven by atherosclerosis, is the leading cause of death in the U.S. The recent\nFDA Modernization Act 2.0 allows the use of alternatives to animal models in drug testing, spurring the\ndevelopment of advanced in vitro models like cell-based assays and artificial intelligence-based systems to\nstreamline drug development processes. However, current atherosclerosis assays, mostly based on simple 2D cell\ncultures, don't adequately replicate the disease's complexity, potentially leading to inaccurate results.\nTo address this issue, Endomimetics has developed innovative nanomatrix cell sheet technology and \u201ccell-as-\nglue\u201d approach as well as formulated novel atherosclerotic inducing mediums, which can produce an in vitro 3D\nnanomatrix vascular sheet (VS) and a novel 3D in vitro atherosclerosis model - nanomatrix vascular sheet with\natherosclerosis (VSA).\nTherefore, our aim is to revolutionize the field by developing an automated, highly precise approach for fabricating\nVS and VSA. This advancement will enable the use of VS and VSA in creating functional assays for efficient, high-\nthroughput drug testing in a 3D human atherosclerosis environment and allow for the evaluation of both the efficacy\nand cytotoxicity of drugs across extensive sample sizes, while minimizing biological variability. Such an initiative,\nunprecedented in its scope and precision, has not yet been achieved in any existing in vitro atherosclerosis assays.\nSpecifically, we will develop two innovative assays integrating BODIPY staining and ELISA methods, aimed at\ndetermining the efficacy of atherosclerosis treatments by their capacity to suppress foam cell formation and curtail\ninflammatory cytokine production.\nEstablished anti-atherosclerosis and anti-inflammatory compounds will serve as positive controls, validating the\naccuracy of the assays in detecting reductions in both foam cell formation and cytokine secretion. Simultaneously,\nnegative controls will be employed to evaluate assay specificity, ensuring the precision of our results, and\neliminating the potential for false positives.\nTo demonstrate the feasibility of our assays in evaluating new atherosclerosis therapeutics, we will assess the\nefficacy of two histone deacetylases inhibitors at various doses using our assays. Additionally, we will develop\nand execute cytotoxicity-based assays to investigate the safety of these inhibitors.",

Systemic administration\nof these immunosuppressive agents increases the incidence of infectious disease and malignancy, which are\nthe leading causes of death in transplant patients. While new tolerance induction strategies are evolving, like\nTreg therapies and mixed chimerism, they are limited in their ability to only be used for living donor transplants\nand difficulties in ex vivo culture and expansion. However, developments in the field of ex vivo machine\nperfusion of transplanted organs now offer unique therapeutic opportunities to treat donor organs prior to their\nimplantation into the recipient. My work focuses on creating a system that leverages advances in ex vivo\nperfusion to install a bio-orthogonal surface targeting moiety on an organ, which is introduced to the organ via\nex vivo perfusion during its time in transport. I hypothesize that this targeting system will allow for the\nsystemic dosing of lipid nanoparticles that bind only to vascular endothelium expressing the bio-\northogonal target within the organ, therefore allowing for localized immunosuppression and immune\ntolerance induction, while minimizing the highly undesirable and toxic side effects of\nimmunosuppressive drugs. Aim 1 of this proposal demonstrates the targeted drug delivery to vascular\nendothelium via lipid nanoparticle binding to permanently expressed bio-orthogonal moiety in two dimensional\nendothelial culture. Aim 2 includes the optimization and demonstration of the LNP targeting system to\neffectively deliver therapeutic cargo under physiological sheer stress and flow conditions. This will be\nperformed in ex vivo perfused human blood vessels. Aim 3 harnesses the ability of the system to be utilized in\na relevant heterotopic murine heart transplantation model as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the ability for\nthe targeted particles to localized to a transplanted organ.\n This proposal builds around four key components of critical research and clinical skills to support my\ndevelopment into an independent physician scientist: (1) an interdisciplinary research project focusing on a\nnovel nucleic acid delivery system for the selective delivery of therapeutics to a transplanted organ (2) multi-\ndisciplinary mentoring from Drs. Grinstaff (biomaterials, nanoparticles, drug delivery) and Osho (clinical\nmedicine, animal models, and ex vivo perfusion), (3) academic physician scientist training in research\nconduct and communication skills, (4) clinical awareness program, overseen by Dr. Osho a na\ufffdonally recognized\nleader in the \ufb01eld. (5) professional development to guide my training goals.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nKnowledge about the human microbiome has increased exponentially in the last twenty years, leading to its\nassociation with a wide variety of conditions and diseases. However, many of the mechanisms underlying the\nrelationships between microbes and their human hosts have not been elucidated, particularly at the tissue level.\nThe human extracellular matrix (ECM) provides important structural and biochemical cues for the development\nand homeostasis of all human tissues. Extensive ECM remodeling is a prominent feature of several diseases\nlinked to human microbiome dysfunction including pulmonary cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and\ncervical cancer. Yet, regardless of tissue or body part, host cells (e.g. fibroblasts, macrophages, and neutrophils)\nare considered the primary drivers of ECM degradation, even though human-associated microorganisms are\nknown to secrete active proteases. Thus, crucial ECM-microbiome interactions should be included in existing\nparadigms of host ECM remodeling. To address this important knowledge gap, our lab develops in vitro and ex\nvivo models using biomaterials and tissue engineering strategies to explore the fundamental mechanisms behind\nECM-microbe interactions. We hypothesize that commensal microbiota can degrade human ECM and that\nECM remodeling, in turn, alters host cell behavior. The proposed research program will initially answer three\nkey questions: 1) What environmental conditions enable bacterial degradation of host ECM? Our\npreliminary data demonstrates that commensal bacteria grown in complete growth medium can degrade\nindividual ECM components in vitro. Because environmental factors influence bacterial metabolism, we will\nexplore how factors such as pH, and nutrient source impact ECM degradation by gut and vaginal bacterial\nspecies. 2) How do human-associated bacteria remodel host ECM? In parallel to question 1, we will use\nmetaproteomics and inhibition studies to identify the specific proteases and carbohydrate degrading enzymes\ninvolved in ECM degradation. Additionally, we will develop an ex vivo tissue culture model to characterize the\nextent of bacterial ECM remodeling. 3) What are the consequences of microbiota-driven ECM remodeling\nfor host immune cells? Because the ECM regulates cell behavior, we will test the hypothesis that ECM modified\nby the microbiome impacts host cell function. We will generate in vitro biomaterial platforms that capture the\nproperties of native ECM and incubate them with microbiota culture supernatant. We will then expose innate\nimmune cells to the remodeled matrices and evaluate their phenotype. This ESI-MIRA award will enable my\ngroup to discover interactions between bacterial microbiota and host ECM, shedding light on the microbiome\u2019s\nunderexplored contributions to tissue maintenance and dysfunction. Ultimately, the vision for my research\nprogram is to determine the impact of the human microbiome on ECM remodeling and leverage this new\nknowledge to develop novel diagnostics and therapeutic strategies.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Computation-aided Molecular Design of DNA-Inspired Janus Base Biomaterials for Intracellular Delivery",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\n The overall goal of this proposal is to develop novel biomaterials for intracellular therapeutics delivery.\nWhile messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are recognized as promising candidates for RNA therapeutics (such as anti-\ninflammatory drugs) as well as research tools (such as delivering Cas9 mRNA for gene editing), unlike many\nchemical molecules or antibody proteins, mRNAs need to be delivered into cell cytoplasm to be functional.\nVarious types of materials have been developed for successful intracellular delivery of small RNAs, but it is still\na major challenge to achieve effective delivery of mRNAs at both cellular and systemic levels. We aim to\novercome this by optimizing the biointerface properties of DNA-inspired Janus base biomaterials using\ncomputational methods for molecular design, with experimental validation.\n There are two important obstacles for effective mRNA delivery: at the cellular level, the delivered RNA\ncargos can be trapped and degraded inside cell endosomes after endocytosis (internalization by cells). For\nexample, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are commonly used delivery vehicles for mRNA in both academic and\nindustrial settings. However, the effectiveness of conventional LNPs is limited by their poor endosomal escape\nability which leads to the destruction of a significant portion of RNA cargos. At the systemic level (when\nadministrated intravenously), RNA delivery materials usually require surface modifications to reduce specific\nand non-specific binding of serum proteins (or formation of protein coronas), increase blood circulation time,\nand improve biodistribution. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a widely used surface modification polymer in clinics,\nbut its efficacy is significantly restricted because it can cause undesired immunogenicity in patients.\n To overcome these limitations, we will develop a novel delivery technology by manipulating the biointerface\nproperties of the DNA-inspired Janus base nanopieces (JBNps). JBNps are slimmer than conventional\nspherical particles, allowing for enhanced infiltration into tissue matrices and barriers. As a result, JBNps have\na distinct advantage for delivery into \u201chard-to-penetrate\u201d tissues such as articular cartilage and kidneys. Our\ncentral hypothesis of this study is that sidechain and zwitterionic modifications can manipulate biointerface\nproperties of JBNps, accomplishing highly effective mRNA delivery into target tissues. Once our hypothesis is\nconfirmed, we can use JBNps to deliver mRNA for articular cartilage and kidney applications such as anti-\ninflammatory mRNA therapeutics.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of brain cancer and ~90% of GBM patients die\nwithin 24 months after diagnosis.1 Treatment options for GBM include surgery and chemoradiation however,\nrecurrence is common, and the disease is universally fatal.2,3 Over the past 20 years, induced neural stem cells\n(iNSCs) have been investigated as a novel modality for the treatment of brain cancer. The ability of iNSCs to\nhome to tumors and kill cancer cells are makes them attractive as a new approach for the treatment of GBM.\nOther potential challenges include the need for repeated invasive surgery for redosing or to remove the\nbiomaterial if it is not biodegradable in nature. To address these limitations, we propose to develop a combination\ntherapy that harnesses long-acting delivery (>90 days) of NSCs using a novel injectable and biodegradable\nbiomaterial and a non-invasive and efficient redosing of NSCs across the blood brain barrier (BBB) using state-\nof-the-art focused ultrasound (FUS) technology for enhanced treatment of GBM. The Scientific Premise of these\nstudies is that A) an injectable biodegradable hydrogel scaffold can be developed that: 1) implements a\ntunable/scalable manufacturing process, 2) can accommodate high concentrations of NSCs (\u2265106 cells/mL) with\ninitial targeted sustained delivery of \u22653 months, and 3) is biodegradable and does not require surgical removal\npost administration; B) a non-invasive systemic redosing regimen of NSCs to recurring GBM using FUS to\ndelivery NSCs across the BBB. Our central hypothesis is that sustained local delivery of NSCs (\uf0b3 3 months)\nalone or in combination with non-invasive redosing using FUS will improve access to residual or recurring tumor\ncells and survival outcomes in preclinical models. This cutting-edge combined approach will be utilized to\nevaluate the scientific premise of our proposal in preclinical mouse models to investigate the safety and efficacy\nof a unique and highly innovative combinatorial technology and treatment approach to improve treatment of\nGBM.",

Interactions of the glycans with glycan binding proteins enable these important\nand diverse biological functions. However, the multivalent nature of glycan-protein interactions, as well as the\ndependence on distance and orientation, have prevented the Glycoscience community from realizing the full\ntherapeutic potential of glycans. The proposed, customizable glycan-modified material will enable the\nidentification and characterization of glycans relevant to human health and explore their effects in a controlled\nand customizable extracellular environment.\nThe first component of the customizable 3D matrix is a suite of thiol-functionalized glycans. Homogeneous glycan\nsubstrates can be tagged with a thiol functionality using reductive amination at the reducing-end of commercially\navailable glycans or those obtained after fractionation of natural samples. Heterogeneous glycan pools can be\nsimilarly prepared after oxidative or enzymatic cleavage of saccharides from biological samples. The thiol-\nfunctionalized glycans produced offer distinct advantages over existing probes in the efficiency and\nspatiotemporal control of the conjugation techniques available. These thiol-modified glycans are first validated\nusing a microarray of the thiol-functionalized glycans attached to a glass surface.

Previous microarray investigations have identified and quantified glycan-\nprotein interactions using direct or indirect detection of fluorescence.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nTelomere length is considered a good biomarker of organismal and cellular aging. Telomeres get progressively\nshorter with each cell division and rates of cellular turnover vary from cell type to cell type and tissue to tissue.\nWhen telomeres become critically short, cells arrest their proliferation and go into senescence resulting in\ntissue dysfunction. Telomere length and the rate of telomere shortening shows a great deal of interindividual\nvariability and is dependent on many factors including genetics, age, environment, and lifestyle. Several age-\nrelated diseases have been associated with telomere shortening including pulmonary fibrosis, COPD, liver\nfibrosis, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, myocardial\nhypertrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, ischemia-reperfusion injury, chronic kidney disease, kidney fibrosis,\nosteoporosis, and osteoarthritis. The effect of genetics on telomere length has been estimated to be 35-85%\nand at least 17 genes have been reported to regulate telomere length and cause telomere biology disorders\n(TBD) when disrupted (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, TINF2, WRAP53, CTC1, RTEL1, PARN, ACD,\nPOT1, NAF1, STN1, ZCCHC8, RPA1, and DCLRE1B).

Our proposal is in response to NOT-AG-23-020, which\nis meant \u201cto encourage the use of existing cohorts and datasets for well-focused secondary analyses\u201d to\naddress critical questions in aging research. We have designed our proposal to harness the unique large data\nresources at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and\nBioVU, and the large public data resources (GTEx consortium, All of Us, and the UK Biobank). We will\nreanalyze these datasets, combining multi-omics modeling and phenome-scale interrogation, to identify new\ngenes and variants responsible for telomere shortening, telomere disease risk, premature aging, and their\nphenome-wide consequences. By re-analyzing large data sets already at our disposal, we will be able to\nidentify novel genes and variants responsible for the telomere shortening and provide a more complete picture\nof the role of aberrant telomere length and dysfunctional telomere maintenance in pathophysiological\nprocesses. A better understanding of the genetic and biological drivers of telomere shortening may provide\ninsights into disease risk, earlier diagnosis, and new kinds of therapies. Our Aims are to: 1) Determine the\ngenetic basis of telomere shortening in diverse tissues, 2) Determine the phenome-wide consequences of\ntelomere length using large-scale biobanks, 3) Identify disease causing variants (DVs) in novel genes\nassociated with Telomere Biology Disorders (TBD)",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY.\nImmunotherapy has become an emerging standard-of-care (SOC) for many different cancer types. However,\nonly 15-20% of patients receive durable benefit. Other limitations include the toxicity of systemically-delivered\nimmunomodulators which may require frequent, high doses and lead to immune-related adverse events (irAEs).\nThe risk of severe, and potentially fatal, irAEs increases as the field moves towards immune/immune and\nimmune/SOC combination therapies. As the \u201cfront line\u201d of tumor/immune interaction, the tumor immune\nmicroenvironment (TIME) is a critical locus of immunomodulation, where the kinds of immunocytes in the TIME\npredict the likelihood of response to diverse immunotherapies. One strategy to favorably modulate the TIME\nfollowing standard-of-care surgical resection, is to localize and sustain immunotherapy at the resection site and\ntumor-draining lymph nodes, reversing the immunosuppressive post-surgical wound healing immune\nmicroenvironment while promoting anti-tumor effector cell immunity. This in situ therapeutic cancer vaccination\napproach can enhance local concentration of potent therapies while minimizing systemic exposure and likelihood\nand severity of irAEs. The use of synthetically engineered microbes as platforms for cancer immunotherapy\nprovides the potential to intelligently direct and modulate immune cells in situ. Our biomaterial-encapsulated\nengineered bacteria are at the forefront of this field, with the ability to carry out targeted localization of engineered\nnon-pathogenic E. coli releasing TIME-modulating therapeutic molecules. This allows for reduced off-target\ntoxicity, dose-sparing, and targeting of multiple immune pathways to address the heterogeneous nature of\ncancers. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that our living in situ vaccination platform EcN-IL12Vax can\nachieve localized and controlled delivery of immunostimulatory cytokines, targeting the post-tumor resection\nimmune microenvironment and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) to produce robust anti-tumor responses\nthat eliminate both local tumor recurrence and lymph node metastases. Importantly, we hypothesize that our use\nof bacteria will stimulate the innate immune system while their IL-12 secretion will stimulate the adaptive immune\nsystem, thereby leading to enhanced residual tumor killing. We will characterize the immune response and\nefficacy of EcN-IL12Vax in two Specific Aims: Aim 1 will develop potent and programmable non-pathogenic E.\ncoli as part of a biomaterial-encapsulated engineered bacterial in situ vaccination platform capable of secreting\nthe immunostimulatory cytokine IL-12. Aim 2 will examine how the duration of IL-12 secretion from EcN-IL12Vax\naffects both the efficacy and durability of the immunologic response within the immunosuppressive tumor\nresection cavity immune microenvironment and tumor-draining lymph nodes. This transformative approach will\nprovide the field with an invaluable in situ cancer vaccine platform that can be modified and leveraged for other\nsolid cancers in future studies and could enable further exploration of additional cytokines and therapeutics with\nsubstantial toxicity at narrow concentration windows where they are both safe and effective.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nThis project will develop and apply new intravital microscopy techniques to gain greater insight into the putative\nbenefits effects of gamma entrainment, a promising nonpharmacological neuromodulation technique for\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and other brain pathologies. Investigators recently demonstrated the powerful effects\nof neuromodulation strategies for preserving synchronized neuronal activity in circuit pathways between the\nvisual cortex, hippocampus, and pre-frontal cortex. Gamma entrainment using sensory stimulus (GENUS) is a\nsimple, noninvasive gamma entrainment technique involving repeated exposure to a 40 Hz visual or auditory\nstimulus. This method is easily translatable, and remarkably, experiments in preclinical animal models show that\nit effectively reduces Amyloid levels and synaptic degradation while evoking morphological changes and cytokine\nsecretion from microglia. In some human patients, the technique has shown promise for reducing cognitive\ndecline. Ostensibly, the stimulus parameters require optimization to improve its efficacy in AD patients. The goal\nof this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how GENUS influences cerebral energy metabolism and\nmicrovascular hemodynamics. Advanced microscopy methods will be developed and applied to mouse models\nof AD to nondisruptively characterize GENUS-related changes to cellular signaling, metabolism, and\nmicrovascular blood flow in the living brain with cellular resolution. By developing new microscopy techniques,\nwe will explore how these indicators of metabolism and cerebral blood flow change in different regions of the\nbrain in response to GENUS neuromodulation. The project\u2019s findings will improve our understanding of the\ntechnique\u2019s operating mechanisms. By understanding how GENUS affects measurable changes of brain\nhemodynamics, the results will eventually guide strategies to optimize its utility in human patients. Ultimately,\nthe project\u2019s findings will facilitate development of accessible, nonpharmacological methods to stem AD\u2019s\ndramatically increasing global prevalence.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "In this proposed project, we plan to fill the knowledge gap of the relationships between\nmicroscopic self-assembled structures, collagen-molecule interactions and macroscopic fiber\nmorphologies of type-I collagen, the primary component of most human tissues and a commonly\nused biomaterial for tissue engineering. By investigating collagen-water and collagen-protein\ninteractions in in vitro systems that mimic basic aspects of physiologically relevant three-\ndimensional fibrillar tissue architectures, we aim to fill knowledge gaps in fundamental collagen\nresearch. We will achieve this goal by developing a hyperspectral imaging technique \u2013 vibrational\nsum frequency generation (VSFG) microscopy \u2013 at high repetition rates (400 kHz) and apply it to\ncollagen. The long-term vision is to develop new biophysics methods to reveal molecular-level\nstructures and interactions for pericellular space research and other complex biological\nenvironments, and eventually applying it to study various pericellular environment related\ndiseases. In order to correlate spectral features to microscopic and macroscopic structures of\ntype I collagen, we plan to apply machine-learning techniques to analyze our data and extract\nspectral signatures of collagen\u2019s micro/macrostructures. We will two major scientific focuses: (A)\nunderstanding molecular signatures of microscopic self-assembly fibrils structures and its\nrelationship to the macroscopic morphology (plan 1 and 2); and (B) investigating molecular level\ncollagen-molecule interactions (plan 3 and 4). Specific plans include:\n 1. Obtaining hyperspectral VSFG images of collagen tissues to study their morphology in a\n label free and non-invasive manner\n 2. Establishing molecular spectral signatures of self-assembled collagen fibril structures\n 3. Understanding collagen-water interaction in first solvation layer of collagen fibers.\n 4. Imaging spatial locations of chemicals and peptides that interact with collagens.\nIf successful, the significance is that a label free, vibrational mode specific imaging technique\nspecific for pericellular space will be available, which can reveal molecular level insights of\ncollagen structures and its interactions with surrounding molecules, pertinent to fibrosis and cell\u2014\npericellular space interaction related diseases. This proposed project contributes to the scope of\nNIGMS by developing new technology to reveal fundamental molecular-level principle,\nmechanism and signatures related to morphology of collagen I at both micro- and macroscopic\nscales, and collagen-molecule interactions, laying foundations for biophysical/biochemical\nprinciples for future biomedical applications related to collagens.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nEndophthalmitis is a devastating complication caused by a wide range of microorganisms which can result in\nirreversible vision loss if not diagnosed and treated promptly. The current diagnostic approach heavily relies on\nmicrobial culture to determine the etiology of endophthalmitis. However, only ~40% of suspected endophthalmitis\ncases are culture-positive, leaving many potentially infectious culture-negative cases. Therefore, the discovery\nof potential biomarkers is urgently needed for both the diagnosis of endophthalmitis and in guiding appropriate\nantimicrobial therapy. Here, we propose to use metabolomics, an emerging high-throughput technology that can\nidentify, quantify, and characterize hundreds to thousands of low molecular weight biochemicals (metabolites),\nusing targeted or untargeted analytical approaches. Since metabolism is directly or indirectly linked to every\naspect of cell function, metabolomics is believed to reflect the phenotype of what is occurring in the body.\nRecently, we performed untargeted metabolomics in an experimental model of endophthalmitis and discovered\ndistinct metabolic profiles of uninfected and bacterial-infected mouse eyes. Moreover, metabolomics analysis\nled to discovering a therapeutic target, i.e., itaconate/Irg-1 signaling, to ameliorate experimental bacterial\nendophthalmitis. Our pilot vitreous metabolomics analysis showed distinct metabolic profiles in patients with\nuveitis, endophthalmitis, and other inflammatory retinal diseases. Based on preliminary data and our prior\npublications, we hypothesize that \u201cintraocular infections induce biochemical changes in the vitreous leading to\ndistinct metabolic signatures with translational potential for therapeutic targeting and/or diagnosis of infectious\nendophthalmitis\u201d. This will be tested by performing untargeted metabolomics in vitreous of culture-positive\nbacterial and fungal endophthalmitis (Aim-1). We will further devise a metabolic profile to aid in predicting\nendophthalmitis in culture-negative chohort. This will be accomplished this by developing an artificial intelligence\n(AI) model that can predict endophthalmitis' etiology based on vitreous metabolic profiles (Aim-2). The\nexperiment will also involve validation using an independent cohort of culture-positive vitreous. The proposed\nstudy will be the first to utilize metabolomics profiling to identify the metabolic sigantures in the vitreous of\nendophthalmitis patients. The resulting profiles and/or biomarkers will be readily translatable for future clinical\nstudies, ultimately guiding precision medicine for diagnosing and treating ocular infections.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Co-Formulations of Amylin Analogues with Insulin Analogues for Treatment of Diabetes",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe ultimate goal of the proposed work is to develop a novel co-formulation of insulin analogues (e.g. lispro\nand aspart) with an amylin analogue (e.g. pramlintide) and with incretin hormones (e.g. liraglutide), to enable a\ntransformational new treatment for diabetes constituting a true replacement therapy. The most challenging\naspect of optimal glycemic control for the 1.45 million people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the United States is\nlimiting large increases in blood glucose after a meal. People with type 1 diabetes do not produce the insulin\nrequired for the body to process glucose, so insulin must be replaced by daily injections. Amylin is a small\npeptide hormone excreted alongside insulin by pancreatic \u03b2 islet cells that acts centrally to slow gastric\nemptying, suppress postprandial glucagon secretion, and decrease food intake, thus complementing the action\nof insulin to regulate blood glucose levels. Similar to insulin, amylin production is completely absent in\nindividuals with type 1 diabetes on account of their lack of pancreatic \u03b2 cells. T1D is also characterized by\nabnormal suppression of glucagon secretion in response to hyperglycemia. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is\nan incretin hormone and neurotransmitter secreted from intestinal L-cells in response to nutrients to stimulate\ninsulin and suppress glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists\n(GLP-1 RAs) have become central to the treatment of diabetes and while these drugs are not yet approved for\nT1D patients, GLP-1 RAs appear to be well tolerated in patients with T1D and could have beneficial effects in\nboth new onset and longstanding T1D patients. As an adjunctive therapy to insulin, GLP-1 RAs can improve\nglycemic control and body weight in longstanding disease while also reducing insulin requirements in T1D\npatients. Current administration regimens for these therapeutics are highly burdensome as they must be\ninjected either daily or weekly or taken daily orally. A true replacement therapy, therefore, would administer\nboth amylin and insulin simultaneously, while also delivering GLP-1 RAs. Unfortunately, Symlin (Pramlintide;\nAstraZeneca), the only commercial amylin analogue formulation, is formulated at pH~4 while Novolog (Aspart;\nNovonordisk) and Humalog (Lispro; Eli Lilly), insulin analogue formulations, are typically formulated at pH~7.4,\nmeaning that these formulations are incompatible and must be administered in separate injections. While\ntreatment of diabetes with separate injections of insulin and amylin analogues at mealtimes has been shown to\nbe much more effective than insulin alone at managing diabetes, the administration of two separate injections\nis burdensome. We have developed a novel polymeric excipient that results in stable, ultra-fast acting insulin,\nto formulate insulin and pramlintide together to enable a single administration treatment mimicking endogenous\nhormone secretion. Additionally, we can effectively incorporate GLP-1 RAs into these formulations. This novel\ncombination therapy will yield unprecedented postprandial glycemic control and catalyze the development of a\npowerful tool for the management of diabetes affording thus far unrealized therapeutic impact.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nWithin healthy adult tissues, a developing organism, and disease environments alike, cells exist in environments\nwhere they receive and integrate external signals according to a phenotypic state, yielding responses in\ncellular activities and behaviors or modifications to phenotypic state. Fundamental understanding of cellular\nfunctioning and disease progression depends in part on our ability to systematically build and perturb model\ncellular systems in vitro, and pressing biomedical challenges in translational medicine might be addressed\nthrough the technology that enables breakthroughs in tissue engineering, including in meeting the critical\nneeds of patients awaiting organ transplants. Over the past decades, a range of biofabrication technologies\nhave been used to precisely arrange cells and materials within two- and three-dimensional structures. These\ntechnologies have broadened our understanding biology and increased the complexity of tissue constructs that\nmight be used therapeutically. While biofabrication approaches developed over this time have greatly\nbenefitted our abilities to probe and understand biological questions\u2014especially with respect to cells and their\nenvironments\u2014and to engineer cell-material constructs that recapitulate features of native tissues, significant\nchallenges persist in building multiscale biomimetic tissue constructs. Our lab\u2019s research is focused on\naddressing these challenges through the development and application of new biofabrication technologies that\nare based on innovation in the design and use of hydrogel biomaterials. Within the next five years, the lab aims\nto develop and apply unique hydrogel-based technology to bioprinting to address the critical need for\ncapabilities to create vascularized tissue constructs in which cell and material complexity can be specified in\nextravascular regions and that can support dense cell populations. The lab will also develop new biofabrication\ntechnologies that will allow unique capabilities for high resolution control over cellular and material structures\nwithin macroscale constructs, with the goal of being able to simultaneously control a broad range of\nmicroenvironmental features\u2014including cell-cell interactions, biochemical cues, and biomechanical cues\u2014that\na given cell experiences. We aim to develop technological capabilities and ultimately apply these capabilities to\nbuilding complex tissue constructs that might be used as platforms for studying tissue and vascular responses\nto perturbations by physical and biological stimuli and to address key challenges in tissue engineering to\ndevelop therapeutic tissue constructs. The work in this proposal thus aims to advance capabilities in the fields\nof biofabrication and tissue engineering, with broad potential impacts in applied and translational research.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Summary\nHeart failure post-myocardial infarction (MI) continues to be the leading cause of death in the U.S. Each year it\nis estimated that ~550K Americans will have a new MI, and ~200K will have a recurrent MI, leading to a large\nbody of patients suffering from heart failure. These staggering statistics necessitate the development of new\ntherapies for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine strategies\noffer significant potential for the development of novel therapies to treat these patients. While cell therapies have\nbeen extensively studied for the treatment of MI and heart failure, meta-analyses of initial cell therapy trials\nsuggest only a modest effect on cardiac function. More recently acellular biomaterials have shown great promise\nin providing similar or greater functional benefit without the complications associated with cell delivery. Injectable\nbiomaterials that stimulate endogenous repair are an attractive alternative since potential therapies could still be\ndelivered minimally invasively via catheter yet could be off the shelf and have significantly reduced costs\ncompared to cell products. Ventrix is therefore focusing on cell-free regenerative medicine approaches. Ventrix\nhas a history of success in developing injectable biomaterials for treating ischemic cardiomyopathy. Two\nprevious NIH SBIRs resulted in an approved IND for VentriGel, an injectable, catheter-deliverable hydrogel\nderived from decellularized porcine myocardium. This led to a recent successful Phase 1 clinical trial in patients\n60 days to 3 years post-MI. We recently developed a new Infusible ECM, for treating acute MI. We showed it\ncan be delivered to an acute MI via intracoronary infusion and that it improves cardiac function in a rat acute MI\nmodel following simulated intracoronary delivery. In our previous studies, we optimized delivery and retention of\nInfusible ECM and demonstrated preliminary feasibility and efficacy in a porcine acute MI model. The studies\nproposed in this Phase II project are part of the final steps to initiate studying Infusible ECM in patients, and a\nkey step in bringing a biomaterial product to market, which will be complementary to existing standard of care.\nThis will be the first intracoronary infusible regenerative biomaterial product for treating acute MI patients.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nGenitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is an extremely prevalent condition consequent to the\nhypoestrogenic changes in the genitourinary tract that affects up to 85% of perimenopausal and menopausal\nwomen. Major symptoms of GSM include vaginal dryness, itching, discomfort, burning, and pain; thus, GSM\nsignificantly impacts quality of life during everyday activities and severely impairs sexual function. Despite its\nhigh prevalence and interference with healthy aging, current treatments for GSM are suboptimal, with many\nissues related to accessibility or long-term efficacy. Despite an astoundingly low satisfaction of only 35% with\ntreatments for GSM, whether prescribed or over-the-counter, women continue to suffer from lack of better\noptions. Thus, there remains a need for a safe and accessible therapy for this morbid condition that can both\nalleviate symptoms and restore a healthy vaginal phenotype. The proposed study will determine if a low-cost,\nacellular, tissue-specific, and minimally invasive regenerative therapy can repair the atrophic vaginal tissue,\nresulting in an accessible, high-impact intervention for GSM. Given our previous successes with tissue-specific\npro-regenerative biomaterials, we opine that a novel vaginal tissue-derived ECM hydrogel (vECM) will reverse\nvaginal atrophy by inducing epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation as well as neovascularization when\ndelivered as a topical treatment, and by improving tissue elasticity and smooth muscle phenotype when delivered\nvia injection. Using a validated preclinical model of GSM and an array of diverse multi-scale tools, we will\ncomprehensively characterize alterations in vaginal structural and functional properties due to menopause. We\nwill then create a novel biomaterial designed specifically to women\u2019s health and assess its efficacy in treating\nGSM \u2013 a chronic and understudied condition that negatively impact lives of millions of women world-wide.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe overarching goal of this proposal is to expand fundamental knowledge of bone repair mechanisms and\nimprove regenerative strategies for craniofacial bone repair by investigating microenvironmental factors\ninfluencing osteogenic differentiation and bone regeneration. This work will employ a variety of biomimetic\nhydrogels, designed to recapitulate the extracellular matrix during distinct stages of bone formation: (1) soft\ncollagen represents the initial matrix where undifferentiated stem cells reside, (2) high-density collagen reflects\nmesenchymal condensation, (3) partially mineralized high-density collagen simulates onset of calcification, and\n(4) a fully mineralized state indicative of mineralized woven bone. My preliminary data shows an early onset of\nosteogenic differentiation in human mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (hMSC) cultured on biomineralized\nhydrogels. However, the mechanisms to explain this accelerated regenerative response has not been thoroughly\ninvestigated. I hypothesize that increased in matrix density and mineralization will enhance osteogenic\ndifferentiation and bone regeneration. This hypothesis will be tested via Aim 1 by looking at adhesion-driven\nmechanotransductive mechanisms in vitro and Aim 2 by evaluating the in vivo bone healing response.\nSpecific Aim 1 will examine the effect of the hydrogel model on osteogenic differentiation, focusing on the\nmolecular clutch of mechanotransduction \u2013 a process where mechanical stimuli from the microenvironment is\ntranslated into biochemical activity, prompting cellular responses. This aim will evaluate the in vitro hMSC\nbehavior in response to these hydrogels, looking at focal adhesion, mechanotransductive, and differentiation\nmarkers. Specific Aim 2 extends this analysis to an in vivo setting, testing the regenerative capacity of injectable\nmicrogels in rat calvarial (skull) defects. By providing a comparative analysis of bone healing with the aid of\nmicrogels of varying density and mineralization, this aim focuses on understanding the systemic host response\nto bioengineered grafts to be able to identify microenvironmental conditions that enhance bone regeneration.\nThis application outlines a comprehensive training plan at a well-established institution, designed to develop my\nexpertise in bone tissue engineering and stem cell biology, essential for becoming a craniofacial surgeon-\nscientist.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\n Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold tremendous promise for cell therapy. However, the\nsignificant tumorigenic risk associated with residual iPSCs in cell mixture during cell transplantation remains a\nmajor obstacle to their clinical applications. To address this challenge, we have assembled a multidisciplinary\nteam consisting of a biomaterials chemist (Xu) and a stem cell biologist (Lu). Our goal is to develop and evaluate\ntransient intranuclear peptide assemblies (nPAs) to selectively eliminate residual iPSCs without impacting iPSC-\nderived cells in cell mixture\u2014an unmet need in the field. We recently achieved selectively eliminating iPSCs\nwithout harming iPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) using transient nPA. This selectivity hinges\non the well-documented overexpression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in iPSCs. ALP catalytically\ndephosphorylates a phospho-L-peptide precursor, forming transient nPAs capable of eliminating iPSCs. This\nnPA precursor exhibits exceptional selectivity, rapidly eradicating iPSCs in cell mixture within 2 hours due to\nthree key factors: (i) iPSCs express high levels of ALP, (ii) ALP expression decreases significantly in iPSC-\nderived and normal cells, and (iii) nPAs comprise L-peptides that undergo proteolysis within the cellular\nenvironment. However, it remains to be verified whether nPA precursors/building blocks would affect iPSC-\nderived cells beyond HPCs and whether the elimination of residual iPSCs in the cell mixture is sufficient to\nprevent tumor formation from the cell transplantation in vivo. Additionally, the design principles governing nPA\nprecursors have yet to be established. Therefore, we propose to explore nPAs for eliminating residual iPSCs\nfrom cell mixtures containing iPSCs and iPSC-derived photoreceptor precursor cells (PPCs) by the studies\nfocusing on three specific aims: Aim 1: Design, synthesize, and characterize nPA precursors to conduct a\npreliminary structural-to-activity relationship (SAR) study. Aim 2: Evaluate nPAs on iPSCs and iPSC-derived\nphotoreceptor precursor cells (PPCs) using cell assays. Aim 3: Examining the efficacy of nPAs to prevent tumor\nformation from cell transplantation using a standard murine model. The successful completion of these studies\nwill provide a novel approach to eliminate residual iPSCs rapidly and selectively in cell mixtures, substantially\nenhancing its safety profile of transplantation of iPSC-derived cells and thereby improving the treatment of\nvarious human diseases.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\n Veterans and the general public with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have a high risk of developing\nposttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression. The\npathophysiological basis that contributes to comorbid PTSD and other psychiatric disorders following TBI is not\nyet understood, and there are currently few effective treatments for comorbid TBI/PTSD. Serotonergic\ndysfunction and neuroinflammation are strongly associated with TBI and psychiatric disorders. Gut microbiota\ndysfunction induces inflammation and affects tryptophan metabolism, a precursor of serotonin, which is\ninvolved in serotonin biosynthesis. Studies conducted on patients with PTSD and other psychiatric disorders,\nas well as mice exposed to experimental stress, have shown a high correlation between perturbation in gut\nmicrobiota and mental disorders. TBI also induces gut microbiota dysbiosis. However, the cause-effect\nrelationship and the underlying mechanisms by which gut microbiota disruption following TBI impacts comorbid\nPTSD and other psychiatric disorders are still largely unknown. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), small nanovesicles,\nplay a crucial role in cellular communication and carry various molecules. Bacterial EVs in the gut contain\nbacterial genetic and biomaterials that are associated with virulence and considered causative agents in many\ndiseases, while EVs produced by select probiotics have great therapeutic potential. Our pilot data reveal that\nadministration of TBI-gut-EVs to gnotobiotic mice affects the expression of genes related to host serotonin\nmetabolites and neuroinflammation. In contrast, treatment of TBI animals with EVs derived from select probiotics\nsignificantly increases host serotonin levels and alleviates psychiatric-like behavior. Based on our novel findings,\nwe hypothesize that the changes in gut microbiota-derived TBI-gut-EVs are involved in the regulation of\nserotonergic neurons, neuroinflammation, and PTSD-like behavioral impairments following TBI. The successful\ncompletion of this study will not only provide new insight into the pathogenesis of TBI, but also promote the\ndevelopment of novel microbial-based therapy for preventing and/or treating comorbid TBI/PTSD, and potentially\nother psychiatric disorders.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nMucus acts as a defensive barrier in the airways by trapping inhaled particles within a mucin gel network and\nclearing them from the airway via mucociliary transport performed by the underlying airway epithelium. Muco-\nobstructive airway diseases including cystic fibrosis (CF), asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nare caused by the buildup of thick mucus with an aberrant composition that is not able to be dynamically cleared,\nresulting in occluded airways. Mucus accumulation also leads to chronic bacterial infection in the airways,\nespecially by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in CF patients. One abnormal component found in excess within the\nmucus of patients with muco-obstructive diseases, most prominently in CF mucus, is neutrophil extracellular\ntraps (NETs). NETs are web-like complexes comprised mainly of decondensed chromatin intermixed with\nneutrophilic granular proteins that are secreted extracellularly to capture and kill bacteria in a process known as\nNETosis. DNase is currently used by CF patients to degrade the chromatin structure of NETs in the mucus but\noften does not fully restore mucociliary transport in patients, indicating the granular components of NETs are\nalso likely involved in mucus dysfunction. In our previous research, we used a synthetic biomaterial model of the\nchromatin structure of NETs to evaluate the effects on mucus biophysical properties and mucociliary transport\nvelocity. Building upon this, we propose to use both biomaterial and human airway tissue culture models to\npursue the following objectives: 1) determine how various granular proteins within NETs differentially affect\nmucus biophysical properties and transportability across the airway epithelium, and 2) determine how the\nalterations to mucin composition and glycosylation in CF mucus contribute to the increased NETosis observed.\nFor the first objective, we will employ similar synthetic NET biomaterial models, but incorporate neutrophilic\ngranular proteins into the formulation to evaluate their specific contributions in enhancing mucus viscosity and\ndecreasing mucociliary transport in CF airways. We will also account for the effects of inhaled DNase therapy\nused by CF patients to determine if granular proteins continue to cause mucociliary transport dysfunction after\ndegradation of the chromatin scaffold of NETs. In the second objective, we will manipulate the expression of\nsecreted mucins and mucin glycosylation patterns of human airway tissue to understand how mucins and their\nglycans modulate the activation of NETosis in neutrophils. We will account for the effects of P. aeruginosa\nbacteria on mucin glycosylation to determine how NETosis is altered during infection in CF patients. This\nresearch will identify novel anti-NET mucosal drug targets to prevent NETosis and neutralize the effects of NETs\nin the airway mucus barrier. Ultimately, we believe this will lead to improved treatment of CF and other related\nmuco-obstructive lung diseases.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT\nSUMMARY.\nPeriodontitis is one of the most prevalent diseases and a leading cause of tooth loss. In the United States,\napproximately 61 million adults over 30 years old have periodontitis (42.2%) with 7.8% having severe\nperiodontitis. A disproportionate host response and dysbiotic microbiota are the two major etiologic factors. The\nstandard treatment, mechanical debridement, to remove biofilm has limited clinical efficacy in patients with\ndysregulated immune responses. There is a critical need for novel host modulation therapies with safe, localized,\nand effective delivery characteristics to treat periodontitis. Recent advances in synthetic biology have presented\nnew opportunities to use genetically-engineered bacteria for disease treatment. In particular, our team has\ndeveloped genetic tools to program the commercial human probiotic Limosilactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) to\nsecrete anti-inflammatory cytokines to treat inflammatory bowel diseases. Furthermore, we have increased the\nviability and efficacy of these engineered L. reuteri by encapsulating them in biocompatible biomaterials. These\nnovel biotechnological approaches can be effective in treating periodontitis. The goal of this project is to develop\na biomaterial-enhanced system for targeted localization of engineered microbes releasing therapeutic\nmolecules, an \u201coral micro-drug factory\u201d, effective for host modulation and tissue healing. Our objective is to locally\nadminister engineered L. reuteri secreting the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10), to evaluate the\nphenotypic and molecular effects in experimental periodontitis models. The hypothesis is that localized and\nsustained delivery of IL-10 from well-contained L. reuteri can reduce periodontal inflammation and promote\nperiodontal tissue healing. We will achieve our goals through two specific aims: (1) Validate the ability of\nengineered L. reuteri producing IL-10 to treat experimental periodontitis; (2) Use a microneedle patch to localize\nL. reuteri and enable boosted potency delivery of IL-10 to treat specific areas of experimental periodontitis. Well-\nestablished methods will be used to analyze local and systemic immune responses and oral microbiota shifts in\nthese periodontitis-affected animals treated with this novel approach. The outcomes of this project will\ndemonstrate that localized host modulation through the biomaterial-based application of engineered L. reuteri\ncan treat experimental periodontitis. Encapsulation of bacteria in the stable and biocompatible microneedle patch\nattached to the gingiva will improve their effectiveness without allowing L. reuteri to become the dominant oral\nspecies. This will shed light on novel clinical applications of engineered microorganisms able to achieve\nlocalized, sustained host modulation in treating periodontitis using a combinatorial strategy of biomaterials and\nsynthetic biology.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe mortality rates for patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) are 15-40%, depending on the treatment.\nMoreover, the quality of life for surviving patients remains severely reduced. Limb revascularization focused on\nlimb rescue is critical to saving lives and life quality. Cell therapy strategies currently under investigation inject a\nvariety of progenitor cells into ischemic tissue with varying levels of success. However, no one has examined\nthe ability of angiogenic tip-specific endothelial cells (ECs) to promote revascularization in an ischemic limb. We\nhypothesize that angiogenic ECs that contain tip ECs will more robustly revascularize ischemic limbs compared\nwith nonangiogenic ECs. The proposed studies will use highly expandable pluripotent stem cells as the starting\ncell source and derive tip and non-tip cell-containing ECs from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. We\nwill then compare the ability of tip ECs versus non-tip ECs to rescue the muscle in a hind-limb ischemic mouse\nmodel. For delivery, we employ spatially nanopatterned collagen biomaterial scaffolds to enhance cell survival\nafter transplantation into the ischemic limb. Lastly, we will incorporate placental growth factor (PIGF) mRNA\ndelivery from aligned nanopatterned collagen biomaterials to support the release of PlGF protein for maintaining\nthe angiogenic phenotype of tip ECs, and/or directing in vivo the differentiation of stalk-to-tip ECs. We expect\nthese studies to show that angiogenic tip-specific ECs, not only integrate into and support current vasculature in\nthe ischemic limb, but also initiate the growth of new blood vessels, faster re-establishment of tissue perfusion,\nand reproducibly rescue the ischemic limb.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nMucins and other densely glycosylated proteins play critical roles in a number of biological processes, disease\nconditions, and therapeutics. The functioning of these sugar-coated molecular machines depends on their\nstructure, dynamics, and conformational transitions. Experimental techniques for capturing such structural\ndynamics, however, can be extremely challenging and resource intensive. We seek to improve upon some of\nthe existing glycan modeling computational tools as well as design new in silico techniques, as robust alternatives\nto experimental studies. These tools will be used to build interconnected mucin glycoprotein gel systems with\nnative glycosylation patterns, and obtain understanding of functional underpinnings at the molecular level. Effects\nof perturbations in terms of pH variance, varying glycosylation patterns, and charge distribution changes will be\ninvestigated. This will enable detailed comprehension of the physical properties of mucins that drive their\nfunction, as well as the molecular elucidation of disease conditions of cystic fibrosis, mucosal inflammation, and\nmucin-mediated cancers. A multi-modal approach will be employed to study these mucin networks in different\nscales \u2013 (i) first-principles based atomistic modeling to capture the equilibrium structure-dynamics; (ii)\nbiophysics-based coarse-grained methods to describe bulk properties and transitions, and (iii) data-driven\nmachine learning approaches to predict topology and intermolecular interactions. Inspired from mucosal gels,\nwe will use these tools to design novel mucin-like nanomaterials constructed from glycan-peptide heteropolymer\nnetworks to target different biomedical applications. We aim to optimize a machine learning (ML)-driven\ncombinatorics method for glycan arrangement in these polymers that will provide enhanced control over material\nproperties \u2013 a molecular LEGO of glycans geared towards customizable mucin-mimetic biomaterials.",

From\nmorphogenesis and homeostasis to the progression of disease, these changes are associated with both the\nhealthy and unhealthy processes that define human life. My research program at the University of Washington\nis developing robust and uniquely powerful multidisciplinary methodologies to mimic, exploit, and quantify\nthese changes, particularly as they evolve in both time and 3D space (i.e., 4D). In our lab\u2019s first five years of\nexistence, we have: (1) developed a suite of synthetic cell-culture platforms whose biochemical and\nbiophysical properties can be reversibly modulated in 4D using cytocompatible photochemistries, and have\nutilized these platforms to regulate proliferation, migration, differentiation, and intracellular signaling at single-\nand sub-cellular resolutions; (2) introduced a photodegradable material-based approach to generate the first\nendothelialized 3D vascular networks within cell-laden hydrogel biomaterials that span nearly all size scales of\nnative human vasculature (including capillaries); (3) reported the first modular framework for imparting\nbiomaterials with precise degradative responsiveness to multiple environmental cues/biomarkers following\nuser-programmable Boolean logic; and (4) established the first tools for \u201cspatiotemporally resolved\nproteomics\u201d, enabling visualization and quantification of proteins produced in vitro and in vivo within user-\ndefined regions in 4D. The present proposal expands our group\u2019s capabilities in each of these areas, paving\nthe way to new therapeutic targets and treatments of disease through a fundamentally transformed knowledge\nof basic cell physiology. In this project, we will: (1) exploit our 4D-tunable biomaterials to recapitulate and probe\ncardiovascular developmental signaling in vitro, examining the manner in which precise spatial and temporal\npresentation of signaling proteins culminates in orchestrated differentiation; (2) employ synthetic capillaries to\nexamine drug action and resistance, screen therapeutics, and investigate microvascular occlusion, thrombosis,\nand altered remodeling that occurs in many hematologic diseases (e.g., sickle cell anemia, spherocytosis); (3)\ndevelop and deploy hydrogel nanoparticles exhibiting logic-based degradative response to cancer-presented\nbiomarkers to deliver small molecule chemotherapeutics to tumors with unprecedented specificity; and (4)\nextend our 4D proteomic strategies to permit optically and physiologically defined proteomic mapping in living\ntissue and model organisms. Critically, the methods that we are developing and implementing are cell-, tissue-,\nand disease-agnostic, enabling enhanced understanding of a wide variety of biological processes while laying\nthe foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract\nCells probe their biophysical environment by engaging multiple ligands on the extracellular matrix and in solution\nresulting in receptor oligomerization and clustering at the nanoscale. In the fields of biomaterials science and\nnanomedicine, there is a significant need to recreate these complex dynamics by presenting ligands from a\nsynthetic substrate with optimal presentation. However, it is very challenging to develop sufficient design criteria\nat this nano-bio interface due in part to the complexity of the interactions as well as our insufficient ability to\nprecisely control these macromolecular features. We seek to address this fundamental limitation by developing\nquantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models that will allow us to accurately shape synthetic\nmultivalent ligands with optimized biophysical dynamics for programmable cell signaling. Our approach\nsignificantly leverages a new combinatorial platform developed by the PI to precisely fine tune and study these\nchallenging interactions. To do this, our research program has five major thrusts. Thrust 1: Leveraging our\nautomated platform for multivalent ligand synthesis, we will study the spectrum of available hydrodynamic\ncharacteristics and learn how to control their structure with high precision. Thrust 2: We will use molecular\ndynamic (MD) simulations to help us define these macromolecular features then build QSAR models to extract\ndesign criteria. Thrust 3: Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and super-resolution microscopy, we will\nprobe ligand-receptor interactions and characterize the macromolecular contributions towards avidity, specificity,\ncooperativity and super-selectivity. Thrust 4: The implications of these features on cell signaling and ligand\ndirected cell behavior will be characterized. Thrust 5: We will apply this new knowledge to a variety of\napplications including regenerative medicine, nanomedicine and as probes to study signal transduction. These\nfive major thrusts were developed to complement each other towards our long-term goals for developing highly\nbioactive and customizable ligands for programed cell behavior.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe long-term objective of this application is to bring a trachea patch to the market for treatment of pediatric\ntracheal stenosis, or narrowing of the airway, which left untreated can be a life-threatening condition. Currently,\notolaryngologists have only two major options for treating tracheal stenosis. One is a complex surgical procedure\nknown as slide tracheoplasty that few surgeons in the country are qualified to perform. The other is to cut and\nsplay the trachea holding it open using a graft of rib cartilage. Both are difficult, time-consuming procedures with\npotential complications. We have an issued U.S. patent on the trachea patch biomaterial that overcomes the five\nmajor technical hurdles required to replace rib cartilage grafting: 1) mechanical integrity, 2) suturable, 3)\nresorbable, 4) air-tight, and 5) off-the-shelf. There is currently nothing on the market remotely resembling the\nidea of a synthetic patch for tracheal stenosis. While the academic tissue engineering community has focused\nprimarily on regenerating an entire trachea with highly complex strategies, arguably leading to technology in\nsearch of an application, we have focused instead on identifying a specific patient indication with an unmet need\nand designed a technology to fill that void.\n The overall hypothesis is that mimicking the wound healing environment using reinforced electrospun\nscaffolds with gradient presentation of biological factors will maintain tracheal patency and regenerate cartilage-\nlike tissue comparable to healthy tracheas. Two specific aims are proposed to determine the most attractive\ngrowth factor loading for mimicking specific stages of wound healing. Aim 1 will refine growth factor loading by\nevaluating multiple compositions in a subcutaneous model. The final device composition will then be evaluated\nin a capstone in vivo rabbit tracheal defect study in Aim 2.\n Compared to rib cartilage grafting, our trachea patch holds the following advantages: 1) No surgery to remove\nrib tissue, saving operating room time and cost, and eliminating potential complication/infection and morbidity at\nthe rib site (attractive to patients and insurance companies), 2) Easy to use, as it is \u201cplug and play\u201d for surgeons\nwho perform rib cartilage grafting (attractive to surgeons), 3) The gradient design has the potential to improve\nfunctionality and accelerate regeneration, promoting vascularization, macrophage recruitment, and directed\nmatrix synthesis. For several reasons, we focus initial clinical translation on the pediatric population with\nlaryngotracheal stenosis. In the simplest terms, our goal is to fix tracheas for young children around the world\nwith narrowed airways to help them survive and breathe normally again.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n Pediatric long-segment airway defects are caused by congenital malformations or result from trauma,\ninfection, or malignancy. Although rare, these defects are often fatal. There is currently no established surgical\ntechnique to repair long-segment tracheal defects and the reconstructive options remain heroic. Tissue\nengineering has the potential to replace failed tissue with a normal, living organ. Despite its potential, clinical\noutcomes of tissue engineered tracheal grafts (TETG) have been poor.\n The main barriers to translation of tracheal replacement are graft collapse and delayed epithelialization.\nWe assessed the performance of partially decellularized tracheal grafts (PDTG) in our mouse model of orthotopic\ntracheal replacement. Using resorbable biomaterials to stabilize PDTG, we created a Composite Tracheal Graft\n(CTG). We hypothesize the CTG can improve overall survival in long-segment tracheal replacement, attenuate\ngraft collapse, promote extracellular matrix (ECM) production and SAE differentiation.\n To test this hypothesis, we will first assess how CTG promotes ECM regeneration in the tracheal\ncartilage. In our first aim, we will implant PDTG and CTG in a mouse model of tracheal replacement and quantify\nECM production and mechanical properties. Using a conditional knock-out of chondrocyte-mediated ECM\nproduction, we will then assess the impact on graft chondrocytes on ECM production. In our second aim, we will\ndefine how SAE differentiation is promoted by CTG. We hypothesize that modification of graft dimensions with\nsplinting reduces wall shear stress (WSS) resulting in improved epithelial differentiation. To test the effect of\nWSS on SAE differentiation, we will implant PDTG and CTG of normal and small diameter, thus increasing WSS\nby reducing graft radius. To quantify WSS, we will use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to topographically\nmap WSS through the grafts and correlate these values with quantitative immunofluorescenceof neo-epithelium.\nFinally, we will validate CTG performance in an ovine model of tracheal replacement in our third aim. Using\nroutine radiographic and endoscopic surveillance, we will quantify animal survival, clinical manifestations, graft\ndimensions, and graft regeneration.\n This proposal advances the field of airway tissue engineering through the development of a composite\ntissue engineered tracheal graft and defining the mechanical factors contributing to graft regeneration.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nDespite unprecedented clinical success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy against tumors,\nwidespread application is limited by lengthy and labor-intensive ex vivo manufacturing procedures that result\nin: (i) very high costs of therapy of up to half of a million dollars; (ii) delays of weeks or months to infuse CAR-T\ncells to patients with rapidly progressing disease; and (iii) heterogeneous composition and terminal\ndifferentiation of infused CAR-T cells as a result of ex vivo culture that limit CAR-T cell engraftment and\npersistence. Effort to overcome these limitations have focused on closed and automatic manufacturing devices\nto contain the labor needed to manufacture CAR-T cells ex vivo, and allogeneic off-the-shelf CAR-T cells have\nbeen proposed to overcome the need of CAR-T cell manufacturing for each single patient. Despite significant\nachievements in this space, reducing the time, costs and regulatory burden remains a deep unmet need in\nCAR-T cell therapy and significant reducing or eliminating ex vivo procedures remains a critical unmet need. In\nvivo generation of CAR-T cells would eliminate the need for ex vivo procedures, prevent the terminal\ndifferentiation of ex vivo expanded CAR-T cells and ensure the potency and longevity of autologous T cells as\ncompared to allogeneic CAR-T cell products that are extensively manipulated to prevent rejection and graft-\nversus-host disease The research outlined in this proposal develops new biomaterials approaches to reduce\nthe time and effort to produce CAR-T cells in vitro, to enhance CAR-T cell efficacy and persistence in vivo and,\nfinally, to eliminate ex vivo manipulation entirely by generating CAR-T cells entirely within the patient. We\npropose that biomaterial scaffolds displaying anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and releasing pro-proliferative\ninterleukins will mediate simultaneous activation and viral transduction of T cells without centrifugation\n(spinoculation) or transduction agents (retronectin, polybrene) and will facilitate ex vivo genetic reprogramming\nof T cells by reducing the time and expense of activating naive T-cells and transducing them with viral vectors.\nWe next propose that directly implanting scaffolds seeded with peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CAR-\nencoding viral vectors will promote release of CAR-T cells into circulation, eliminating ex vivo CAR-T isolation\nand proliferation protocols to promote a less differentiated cell phenotype associated with longer in vivo\npersistence. Finally, we propose that, through the inclusion of encapsulated T-cell attracting cytokines,\nimplanted biomaterial scaffolds will generate CAR-T cells entirely in situ through recruitment of host T cells to\nthe scaffold, in-scaffold reprogramming of recruited T cells with resident CAR-encoding viral vectors, and\nrelease of reprogrammed CAR-T cells.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Abstract\nIn 2018 approximately 210,000 people in the U.S. underwent a craniotomy requiring cranial flap closure. The\ninstruments used to cut into the skull leave a continuous gap (\u201ckerf line\u201d) between the bone flap and the\nsurrounding skull. While cranial flap closure is relatively routine using plates and screws to fixate the flap, the\nindustry has lacked any real innovation to improve the status quo in patient care. Clinical results are still plagued\nby many patients that spontaneously return with a loose or migrating plate, a devastating CSF leak or even\ninfection that often requires surgical intervention. Not to mention, plates and screws cause artifacts that interfere\nwith follow-up imaging (MRI or CT). Finally, plates and screws don't address the gaps left behind by the kerf line;\ntherefore, bone healing does not fully complete across this space. As a result, patients often complain of pain\nand can feel the plates and screws through scalp and see depressions where the skin sinks\u2014certainly this\neffects their self-esteem. While flap fixation can be augmented with existing bone cements to address some of\nthese problems, they are not ubiquitously used because they lack desired handling properties and/or they\nsignificantly increase the cost of the cranial closure.\nRevBio\u2019s bone adhesive biomaterial called Tetranite\u00ae (TN) could solve these issues. To accomplish this, the\nbone adhesive material is injected into the kerf line, forming a robust fixation bond between the bone flap and\nthe surrounding skull and forming a water-tight seal upon setting. Overtime, the material serves as a scaffold as\nit is gradually resorbed and replaced with bone. Thus, the material serves many functions as a fixation device, a\nsealant, and a fusion device. Therefore, the goal for this project will be to advance the product from pre-clinical\ndevelopment into humans and be the first truly efficacious option for replacing hardware (e.g., plates/screws,\nclips) as a flap fixation methodology. The adhesive system has been fully developed, verified in a published\npivotal animal study, and validated in user handling cadaver trials; therefore, the next stage in the project\nsupported by the proposed grant application would accomplish the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Produce and\nTest a Clinical-Grade Batch of TN for the Pilot Human Study, Aim 2A: Enroll Patients in Pilot Study and\nDemonstrate Feasibility of Intra-operatively Fixating Flaps with TN as a Stand-Alone Device, and Aim 2B:\nPatients Successfully Reach Primary and Secondary Endpoints at 6 and 12 Months Evidencing Safe Use\nand Probable Benefit to Advance to a Larger or Expanded Clinical Study.\nThe proposed human pilot clinical study will demonstrate TN\u2019s ability to fixate cranial flaps as a stand-alone and\nreplacement to hardware fixation for the first time in humans and will substantiate those flaps restored using TN\ncan withstand healing forces with desirable patient cometic outcomes while bone healing is occurring. This study\nwill provide early assessment prior to initiating a larger clinical study and will compare performance to standard\nof care, i.e., plates and screws for cranial flap fixation.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n Regeneration of native skin elements \u2013 hair follicles, sweat glands and adipose tissue, is a highly thought\nafter outcome of wound healing. While, in principle, very large skin wounds in adult mice can spontaneously\nregenerate new hair follicles and new adipocytes, commonly studied small wounds in mice and clinical wounds\nin humans heal with a far less desirable fibrotic scarring. If and how adult skin wounds can be directed to replace\nthe natural tendency for healing with a scar with regeneration of native skin elements remains unknown.\n This application is inspired by a serendipitous discovery that adding an antigen to our novel biomaterial, the\nMicroporous Annealed Particle (MAP) hydrogel, can induce regeneration of new hair follicles when added into\nnormally fibrotic small mouse skin wounds. This immunomodulatory MAP gel provides wound-resident immune\ncells with the molecular triggers that elicit an adaptive immune response to enhance macrophage responses.\nFurther, our studies on naturally regenerating very large skin wound model show that macrophage-fibroblast\ninteractions are essential for stimulating new hair follicle regeneration.\n Through an integrated bioengineering, bioinformatic and experimental approach, this application will\nfocus on testing our new hypothesis that by engineering MAP gels to have specific immune triggers, interactions\nbetween T-cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts in the wound can transform normally profibrotic healing response\ninto highly desirable regenerative response. The first aim of the proposed research is to mechanistically establish\nthe lymphocyte and macrophage subsets and the molecular signaling pathways required for MAP formulations\nwe have created to elicit hair follicle regeneration. This will be achieved using bioinformatic analyses of\ntranscriptomics, proteomic, and functional profiling at single-cell resolution. confirmed with in vivo loss of function/\ntransgenic mouse studies lacking key immune pathways or cells MAP gels. The second aim is to engineer new\ntypes of immunomodulatory MAP gels designed to maximally induce T-cells and macrophage pro-regenerative\nsignals while minimizing pro-fibrotic signals using a high-throughput in vitro assay. The third aim is to determine\nhow MAP gel-induced immune signals enhance lineage plasticity of wound fibroblasts that is prerequisite for\nnew hair regeneration. This will be achieved via an advanced bioinformatic analysis on single-cell transcriptomic\ndata and functional gain- and loss-of-function studies on wound immune cells and fibroblasts.\n The study premise is based on newly accepted-for-publication and extensive preliminary data. The proposed\nstudies are significant because they will establish new immune cell-driven mechanism for enhancing fibroblast\nplasticity and activating embryonic-like regeneration of native skin elements in adult wounds. The proposed\nstudies are innovative because they will establish new types of immune-modulating biomaterials, and new\nparadigm of biomaterial-triggered regenerative response in adult tissues. In the future, the results of this study\nwill drive the development of next-generation immune-modulating wound biomaterials for potential clinical use.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Biomaterial technologies for interrogating sex differences in tissue repair and homeostasis",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAn individuals\u2019 biological sex significantly affects their ability to repair and regenerate tissue. A clear example of\nthis is the reduced ability for women to heal and regenerate new, healthy tissue after menopause, which results\nfrom a significant loss of sex hormone signaling. This reduction in hormone levels disproportionately enhances\nthe risk for many degenerative diseases including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease, and\ndegenerative brain diseases in which the rate of tissue breakdown exceeds the rate of tissue repair. While it is\nknown that several factors contribute to sex differences in tissue repair including biomechanics, nutrition,\nphysical activity level and sex hormones, the interplay between these parameters is not well understood.\nSpecifically, it is unknown how the native sex differences in tissue structure and the resulting differences in\nmechanical function dictate cell phenotype and behavior and how this effect interacts with estrogen signaling to\noverall control tissue repair. Thus, a fundamental, mechanistic understanding of how a cell responds to the\nspatial and mechanical cues of its environment while mediating estrogen signaling is critical to understand why\nsex differences occur in tissue repair and homeostasis and for future patient-centered repair and regeneration\nstrategies. The overall goal of our research program aims to develop biomaterial tools to interrogate sex\ndifferences in tissue repair and homeostasis. Theme 1: Do male and female MSCs respond to spatial and\nmechanical properties of the cell microenvironment differently? There is evidence in many tissues that\nextracellular matrix structure, organization, and resulting function differs between age-matched males and\nfemales. However, there are no studies showing how this affects cell response. Biomaterials engineered to mimic\nboth the fibrous properties of structural collagens and the viscoelastic properties of proteoglycans in the native\nextracellular matrix will be used to assess sex differences in cell response to controlled changes in matrix\nproperties. Theme 2: How does estrogen presentation to the cell affect downstream transcription and behavior?\nWhile estrogen is known to play a role on cell processes, these results are dependent on the concentration and\nthe temporal presentation of estrogen to the cell. To address this limitation, we will use concentration gradient\ngenerator microchips to quickly and accurately determine the effect of estrogen concentration and timing on cell\ntranscriptional activity. Theme 3: Can we engineer biomaterial systems to control release and presentation of\nestrogen to the cells? Release rates in a range of hours to months will be controlled by modulating diffusion out\nof the biomaterials via material chemistry and architecture. The ability to control the rate of release and localize\nto a specific tissue in the body is critical to promote the estrogen effects at the site while reducing the negative\nand potentially deadly off-target effects. Results from these studies will provide future avenues of study to\nunderstand how estrogen and the cell microenvironment drive sex differences in stem cell behavior which is\ncritical for tissue repair and homeostasis in both women and men.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nThe objective of this proposal is to study how a new human-derived biomaterial with granulated structure,\nNatruLage, stimulates adult stem cell differentiation for integrative cartilage repair. Recent advances in the\ntreatment of articular cartilage and bone injuries have shown exciting potential to address matrix degeneration\nassociated with osteoarthritis (OA), a joint disease afflicting millions of people in the United States. New\ncandidate therapies utilize animal- or human-sourced materials to formulate unique microenvironments\nfavorable to stem cell responses that promote healing and integration. In healthy osteochondral tissue, the\nextracellular matrix is organized into interstitial and pericellular domains with specialized cells and signaling\nmolecules. Together, these components define tissue-specific and structure-function relationships which are\nlost during disease progression. Unfortunately, integrative cartilage repair still remains as a major medical\nneed, and new products are required for enhanced and improved therapies. Successful adoption of\nosteochondral tissue therapies requires extensive technical and manufacturing de-risking to meet stringent\nregulatory approval requirements. New innovations must meet current good manufacturing practice (cGMP)\nspecifications and demonstrate pre-clinical evidence of positive cellular and biological responses as well as\nlack of toxicity prior to submission of an investigational device exemption (IDE) package and, later, execution\nof a clinical trial. To improve integrative cartilage repair, we developed a novel granulated extracellular matrix\nwith a proprietary crosslinking technology, termed NatruLage, that is injected into the defect in bone and\ncartilage layers to form osteochondral tissue that closely mimics the natural zonal tissue structure. Our device\nis \u2018flowable\u2019 to deliver densely-packed tissue particles, and enable forming and shaping after delivery through\nunique crosslinking via thiol-functionalized macromolecules. We have evaluated the same NatruLage\ntechnology, using porcine instead of human tissue, and found promising regeneration and integration in a 12-\nmonth large animal (goat) study of osteochondral repair. We are now focused on the development of\nNatruLage using human-derived allograft tissue for delivery of distinct layers of osteochondral tissue. We will\ndefine the appropriate chemistry, manufacturing, and quality controls to support the cGMP production of\nNatruLage for future clinical trials, and we will contribute to understanding the stem cell responses to\nNatruLage. We will pursue three related specific aims. In Aim 1, we will adapt established cGMP facilities for\nproduction of human NatruLage. In Aim 2, we will define specifications for NatruLage reproducibility and donor\nvariability. In Aim 3, we will quantify NatruLage stimulation of adult stem cell proliferation and differentiation.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nOver 25% of adult women experience pelvic floor disorders including stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Stress\nurinary incontinence is characterized by involuntary urination when pressure is exerted on the bladder, such as\ncoughing, sneezing, laughing, jogging and other forms of physical exercises. Incontinence can have a significant\nimpact on a woman\u2019s quality of life and while there are non-surgical interventions such as pelvic floor exercises\nand pessaries, the failure rate is up to 50%. Many women for which non-surgical interventions have been\ninadequate, resort to surgical solutions such as midurethral sling placement. Of the 300,000 patients who receive\nmidurethral sling surgeries in the US every year, 2-3% experience mesh erosion and up to 20% remain\nincontinent which may require revision surgeries where more synthetic mesh is placed, compounding the\nproblem. The primary objective of this Phase I STTR is to establish feasibility of a natural, coaxial electrospun\nscaffold to be used as an alternative to synthetic surgical mesh. Our team is developing a naturally derived\nscaffold that will dissolve over time and replace the support of the urethra with healthy formation of scar tissue.\nThe Phase I project will focus on the fabrication of coaxial scaffolds using silk fibroin and polyhydroxybutyrate\nand the attachment and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) of fibroblasts to those scaffolds compared to\nstate-of-the-art polypropylene. The deposition of ECM of fibroblasts onto the scaffold demonstrates feasibility of\nthe scaffold to promote fibrous growth as the scaffold degrades over time. If our device is successful, we will\ndecrease the complications and need for revision surgeries for thousands of women undergoing midurethral\nsling placements. We hypothesize that a coaxial scaffold with the combination of silk fibroin surrounding a PHB\ncore will provide increased mechanical properties and cell attachment points. In Specific Aim 1, we will develop\na tunable protocol to fabricate coaxial scaffolds of different weight percentages. In Specific Aim 2, we will validate\nthat our coaxial scaffolds are mechanically strong enough to support the urethra by comparing to the properties\ndefined by Lei et al. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will compare ECM deposition and proliferation of fibroblasts\non the coaxially spun scaffolds to the synthetic polypropylene mesh. If all criterion are met and feasibility is\ndeveloped, our device has the potential to move women\u2019s health to a more biocompatible and effective\nalternative for stress urinary incontinence.",

The TRB mission is to train PhD students as interdisciplinary and transla-\ntional research scientists and engineers. The TRB trainees acquire a fundamental and quantitative under-\nstanding of materials, biomaterial-tissue responses, and molecular and cell biology, as well as interdiscipli-\nnary training experiences and education that promote discussion and scientific inquiry in areas outside stu-\ndents\u2019 \u201ccomfort zones,\u201d such as in business and clinical trials. New for this renewal are the following: a jun-\nior faculty mentoring plan, integrated student governance, better data collection, new courses, professional\ndevelopment workshops, student founded and led translational MInT program, Fireside chats with key opin-\nion-leaders, peer mentoring program pairing first year trainees with senior trainees, and more targeted ef-\nforts for underrepresented minority recruitment.\nThe cornerstones of the TRB program are the curriculum and the program elements that combine interdis-\nciplinary research, quantitative science, engineering, and translational-based courses in clinical trials and\nbusiness, with student-organized seminar club, dinners with clinicians, training in professional ethics, indi-\nvidual development plans, and professional workshops/ career panels. Our aim is to teach the unique skills\nand competencies that are essential to thrive in a multidisciplinary collaborative team striving to meet com-\nmon goals in research, development, translation, and, ultimately, commercialization. Since our initial funding\nin 2009, 44 students have participated in the TRB training program: 33 were supported with NIH funds and\n11 were co-funded by the BU Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Chemistry. We have accom-\nplished our demographic and training mission: 21 women (47%), 23 men (53%), 36% minority, 91% reten-\ntion; 100% employment; 22 current students. The TRB trainees have excelled on multiple fronts, including\npublications (112 published papers with 57 first-authored; five in review; five in preparation), patent applica-\ntions (14), oral (56) and poster (177) conference presentations, competitive individual fellowships (19), and\nother awards (27). TRB alumni hold positions ranging from Assistant Professor at Rice University, to a\npostdoctoral fellowship at Harvard, to co-founding biomedical start-ups (e.g., Pharmachk). In this renewal,\nthe continuation of the TRB, with six trainee stipends per year funded via NIH (trainees are supported for\ntwo years) is aligned with the expertise of participating faculty, the availability of a large and strong applicant\npool eligible for and interested in the TRB program (200+ training grant eligible applicants), and an extramu-\nral funding base to provide the appropriate research environment and continued support for NIH trainees\nbeyond their first two years.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nLong-range (>10 \u03bcm) transport of electrons along networks of G. sulfurreducens protein filaments, known as\nmicrobial nanowires, has been invoked to explain a wide range of globally important redox phenomena. The\nremarkable electronic conduction capability of those nanowires has sparked a great deal of interest in the medical\napplication space, such as for building biocompatible materials and biosensor. For more than a decade, G.\nsulfurreducens nanowires were thought to be bacterial type IV pili, supported by many indirect genetic and\nbiochemical observations. Recently we showed that these conductive nanowires are not made of type IV pilins.\nInstead, these structures are a polymerized multi-heme c-type cytochrome, OmcS, which have never been\ncharacterized before. The OmcS filament model is consistent with the known roles of OmcS in Geobacter\nrespiration, but our knowledge of cytochrome appendages is still very limited. This study aims at addressing\nfundamental scientific questions about cytochrome filaments in respiring prokaryotes as well as applying our\ndiscoveries into the general medical field. Specifically, I will: A) identify and characterize novel cytochrome\nfilaments in bacterial and archaeal strains, through bioinformatics algorithms followed by microscopic validation.\nB) Then I will study the conduction mechanism of these filaments by high resolution cryogenic electron\nmicroscopy (cryo-EM) and conductivity measurement. C) Finally, based on these new insights into cytochrome\nfilaments, I will create a novel design for a self-assembled conductive nanowire. These nanowires may be\nderived directly from a novel cytochrome filament or may contain a peptide/protein based self-assembled scaffold\ncore with soluble cytochromes appended to the outer surface. The results will advance our understanding of\ncytochrome nanowires, as well as generating self-assembling nanowire scaffolds that may be used in many\nfuture biomedical applications.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nMetastatic relapse may occur in patients with ER+ breast cancer decades after original diagnosis. Most breast\ncancer related deaths are caused by metastasis and thus identifying at-risk patients and developing therapies to\nprevent reactivation are a crucial challenge. These efforts have been impeded by a lack of understanding of\ncancer cell dormancy in the bone marrow, believed to be the cellular source of metastatic relapse. It is not well\nunderstood how tumor cells interact with the bone marrow microenvironment and how these interactions regulate\ntumor cell dormancy and escape. My proposed research seeks to develop a mouse model of dormancy and\ninvestigate the spatial organization of the bone marrow niche in patient samples in the mentored K99 phase and\ndevelop a biomaterial model of dormancy in the independent R00 phase. I hypothesize (i) cancer stem cells are\na subset of disseminated tumor cells responsible for metastatic relapse and (ii) the bone marrow niche, including\nthe healthy stem cell niche, facilitates dormancy and reactivation of these cells. In Aim 1, I will develop a novel\nmouse model of hormone responsive breast cancer dormancy in bone marrow and evaluate the presence,\nphenotype, and microenvironmental regulation of disseminated tumor cells using optical tissue clearing/3D\nimaging of whole bone. In Aim 2, I will investigate the hypothesis that tumor cell interactions with the bone marrow\nniche control tumor cell phenotype via high dimensional spatial analysis of bone marrow biopsies from patients\nwith breast cancer including imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and spatial single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq).\nIn Aim 3, I will develop a biomaterial model of the dormant bone marrow niche via creating mechanical mimics\nof the three distinct compartments of bone marrow and evaluate the role of mechanosensing in induction and\nmaintenance of dormancy. In the K99 phase of the award, Prof Max Wicha will serve as my main mentor. Dr.\nWicha is a pioneer in the cancer stem cell field and is an expert in breast cancer biology and metastasis. I will\nwork with and consult my collaborators and mentoring team, including Prof Fei Wen (imaging mass cytometry),\nEvan Keller (single cell spatial analysis program), Dr. Dafydd Thomas (pathology core), Prof Gary Luker\n(microscopy), Prof Monika Burness (breast cancer clinical oncology) and Prof Sofia Merjaver (breast cancer\nmolecular biology). My K99 training will consist of developing a novel mouse model of bone marrow dormancy\nand learning bioinformatics approaches to analyze spatial contributions to cellular phenotype in IMC and\nscRNAseq data to propel me toward developing a synthetic dormant bone marrow niche mimic using\nbiomaterials during the independent R00 phase. In sum, the proposed research will address an urgent, unmet\nneed to identify the role of the bone marrow niche in breast cancer dormancy and reactivation, which may provide\na path forward for identifying patients at higher risk of metastasis and developing therapies against reactivation.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT ABSTRACT\nAlthough hydrogel-based materials constitute a multibillion-dollar market, commercial applications for drug\ndelivery and regenerative medicine are extremely limited. Hydrogels have garnered intense interest as\nextracellular matrix (ECM) mimics due to their tailorable permeability, mechanics, and degradability, yet their\nclinical use in this area largely depends on biological materials such as proteins. Although some success has\nbeen met with naturally-derived ECM, these naturally derived materials are often limited by long regulatory\napproval timelines due to the potential to react with other biologics. Synthetic materials are therefore attractive\ndue to their known chemical compositions, but the challenge with their use lies in the lack of complexity as\ncompared to biological systems, which translates to a lack of efficacy in the clinic. Hence, the goal of this\nproposal, and of our research lab, is to expand the toolbox for building complexity and functionality into\nsynthetic hydrogel biomaterials by using dynamic chemistries and monomer sequence-based\nstrategies. This strategy takes much inspiration from nature, as the structure and function of biological polymers\narise from the precise placement of their amino acids or nucleotides. In addition, cells are able to remodel and\nreconfigure the natural ECM over time. Both of these characteristics have proven difficult to engineer into\nsynthetic networks. Hence, our goals over the next five years are to 1) develop hydrogels with reversible\ncrosslinks to quantitatively design reconfigurable matrices, 2) develop synthetic sequence-controlled linkers to\ncontrol hydrogel properties (e.g., mechanics, degradation, activity) using polypeptoids, and 3) combine these\napproaches to develop self-assembled constructs for tissue engineering. We believe our goals will be useful for\nbroad applications in regenerative medicine, therapeutic delivery, and preclinical models of tissue for drug\ndevelopment. In addition, we anticipate that the potential to alter current modes of thinking in hydrogel and\nbiomaterial design is high, and that our work will shed insight to the biological processes underlying cell-matrix\ninteractions. For these reasons, this work is well suited for the R35 Maximizing Investigators' Research Award\nfor Early Stage Investigators.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nMultiple myeloma (MM) accounts for ~23% of all hematologic malignancies with a 2.1% of cancer-related deaths\nin the United States in 2022. Despite tremendous efforts to develop effective therapies, MM remains largely\nincurable, and virtually all patients develop resistance to current therapies. Thus, there is an urgent clinical need\nfor innovative and improved MM therapeutics. It has been demonstrated that bone marrow endothelium is critical\nto MM cell homing, progression, survival, and drug resistance. Specifically, cyclophilin A and E-selectin, a\nhoming factor and adhesion receptor, respectively, expressed by bone marrow endothelial cells, are critical to\nMM survival. Thus, inhibition of cyclophilin A and E-selectin provides a potential therapeutic strategy to abolish\nMM dissemination and resistance. However, direct- and specific-inhibition of cyclophilin A and E-selectin by\nsmall molecules has been elusive. Thus, cyclophilin A and E-selectin are promising candidates for combination\nRNA interference (RNAi) therapy, which inhibits traditionally undruggable targets by directly reducing their\nmessenger RNA (mRNA) expression. The challenge of utilizing small-interfering RNA (siRNA) is the need for\nsafe and effective delivery methods, as siRNA degrades in the bloodstream and does not readily cross\nmembranes. During my predoctoral studies, I have engineered a library of polymer-lipid hybrid biomaterials, that\nin combination with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid conjugates and siRNA, assembled into nanoparticles (NPs)\nvia microfluidic mixing. Through high-throughput in vivo screening, I identified a NP formulation with potent gene\nsilencing in bone marrow endothelial cells in vivo. This formulation was used to encapsulate cyclophilin A siRNA,\nand showed inhibition of MM progression in vivo, and sensitized MM cells to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib,\na current therapeutic modality to treat MM. During the F99 phase, I will improve our NP design by incorporating\nbone marrow endothelial-targeting ligands on the NP\u2019s surface to enhance their specificity to bone marrow\nendothelium, minimizing off-target effects. I will use our targeted NP to co-encapsulate cyclophilin A and E-\nselectin siRNA sequences, and evaluate their inhibition in vitro through adhesion and transendothelial migration\nassays, to determine the invasive abilities of MM cells. Further, I will test our co-delivery siRNA nanotechnology\nthrough a survival study in a validated mouse xenograft model of MM and quantify its effects either alone or in\ncombination with bortezomib. This technology is expected to provide with a broadly enabling platform to target\nother bone marrow-homing cancers. For the K00 phase, I will identify a renowned cancer biology laboratory to\nstudy cell-cell interactions in the bone marrow immune microenvironment utilizing high-dimensional single-cell\napproaches and tissue-engineered models, with the aim to determine mechanisms that drive cancer progression\nand drug resistance. Completion of this project will successfully prepare me to launch an NIH-funded research\nlaboratory that focuses on drug delivery targeting the tumor microenvironment as means of cancer therapy.",

Tendons are strong, collagenous musculoskeletal tissues that transfer mechanical forces from\nmuscle to bone. There is a clinical need for novel regenerative therapies to treat tendon injuries as healing is\nlimited and injuries are associated with long-term loss of function. Three interdisciplinary investigators will work\nas a team to leverage their individual expertise to design a biomaterial polymer platform to control tenogenesis.\nOur team includes experts in the areas of tendon development and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)\ndifferentiation (Dr. Schiele \u2013 Biomedical Engineering), polymeric hydrogels and biomaterials (Dr. Bernards \u2013\nChemical Engineering), and peptide synthesis and organic chemistry (Dr. Waynant \u2013 Chemistry). There is a\nlimited understanding of the biochemical and mechanical factors that regulate tenogenesis. Normal embryonic\nand postnatal tendon development will inform our tenogenic strategy. By leveraging the strengths of the team,\nwe will advance a novel hydrogel platform and knowledge of tenogenic regulators. We will determine the\ncombination of developmentally identified biochemical and mechanical factors that regulate tenogenesis and\ndeliver those factors with a novel biomaterial platform. We hypothesize that developmental factors can be\nrationally designed into a new class of zwitterionic cross-linked polyampholyte hydrogels to direct MSC into\nfunctional tendon cells. The project has two specific aims. Specific Aim 1 develops our team and defines the\nroles that peptides mimicking the developmentally identified cell-cell junction proteins (cadherin-11 and N-\ncadherin) and extracellular matrix proteins (fibronection and collagen) have on the induction of stem cell\ntenogenesis. These signals will be delivered from polyampholyte hydrogels synthesized with novel zwitterionic\ncross-linkers, which are designed to control the presentation of the desired cell signaling peptides. Specific Aim\n2 expands this family of zwitterionic cross-linkers to finetune the mechanical properties of the polyampholyte\nhydrogels to match specific stages of tendon development. This will determine how the tissue elastic modulus\nand biochemical signaling together control tenogenesis. To meet Idaho INBRE goals, this team science project\nalso provides opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to design and test this biomaterial\nplatform, which further enhances the pipeline of well-trained biomedical researchers. The combined results\nfrom this team effort will be a family of tunable zwitterionic cross-linker species that are incorporated into\npolyampholyte hydrogels designed to deliver biochemical and mechanical developmental factors that regulate\ntenogenesis. We anticipate this will represent a significant breakthrough in modeling and understanding tendon\ndevelopment to guide effective regeneration strategies. These results will be the preliminary data for a\ncollaborative NIH funding application.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nHeart failure is a result of aberrant matrix remodeling in the left ventricle; male patients experience ventricular\nwall thinning, whereas females experience ventricular wall thickening. While current pharmacologic agents\npalliate symptoms associated with heart failure, the morbidity of the disease remains high as these treatments\ndo not provide a universal cure, necessitating a sex-specific understanding of heart failure. Mechanical cues and\ngonadal hormones regulate the sex-specific cardiac remodeling observed during heart failure through changes\nin the extracellular matrix (ECM). Resident cardiac fibroblasts that reside in the ventricular wall largely regulate\naberrant ECM remodeling during heart failure, but the sex-specific regulation of cell-mediated ECM remodeling\nremains poorly understood. Both sex hormones and sex chromosomes have been implicated in regulating sex\ndifferences in cardiac ECM remodeling, but current methods do not decouple their synergistic effects. My\nproposal seeks to decouple the effects of sex chromosomes and sex hormones using gonadectomized animal\nmodels and biomaterials-based cell culture tools that recapitulate the cardiac ECM during fibrotic stiffening. Our\nlaboratory tools enable our central hypothesis: sex chromosome combination and gonadal hormones\nsynergistically regulate myofibroblast phenotypes, and X-chromosome linked genes and estrogen\ndosage will promote myofibroblast matrix remodeling. The hypothesis will be investigated through the\nfollowing aims: Aim 1 will improve our understanding of myofibroblast populations that drive sex-specific matrix\nremodeling independent of gonadal hormones; Aim 2 will use engineered hydrogels to mimic sex-specific\nmyofibroblast phenotypes in vitro; Aim 3 will investigate the role of estrogen and estrogen receptor expression\non mediating the myofibroblast phenotype independent of sex chromosome combination. By leveraging animal\nmodels and biomaterial technologies, this study will unveil a robust understanding of the myofibroblast phenotype\nby decoupling the effects of sex chromosomes and sex hormones. If successful, the proposed research will\nsignificantly advance the understanding of sex-specific biology in myocardial fibrosis.",

Unfortunately,\nboth AVFs and AVGs have high failure rates due to an aggressive venous segment stenosis which\nresults in multiple interventional procedures, hospitalizations, and increased catheter (CVC) use. This\nresults in vascular access also being the Achilles Heel of hemodialysis and an important unmet clinical\nneed which results in a very significant morbidity, mortality, and economic cost (over 5B USD per\nannum).\nIn this proposal we will combine expertise and experience from both industry and academia to create\nan innovative vascular conduit (the Functional INtegrated Electrospun [FINE] device) that comprises\nan inner Cu-PAS core surrounded by an outer P4HB sheath that will have (a) a precisely controlled\nmicrostructure to promote host cell integration (b) anti-bacterial and immunomodulatory properties (c)\nvein-artery-matched geometry to minimize upstream injury pathways and (d) an intrinsic self-sealing\nability that allows for early cannulation.\nAt an operational level we plan to (a) selectively design, refine and prototype FINE devices (b)\ndocument the safety and efficacy of selected FINE devices in a pig arteriovenous access stenosis\nmodel and (c) develop clinical scale production capabilities for the FINE device.\nIn summary, this proposal brings together a trio of unlikely partners (industry x 1 and academia x 2)\nthat between them have the science, the infrastructure, the experience, and the people to bring\ndisruptive change to dialysis vascular access. While none of us on our own could have done what is\ndescribed in this proposal, we would also venture to say that the sum of the individual parts will in this\ncase be exponentially larger than the whole.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nCellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technologies have provided unprecedented\naccess to the human central nervous system (CNS). They have enabled the assembly of models for the\ninvestigation of neurodevelopment and neurological disease mechanisms, which have led to significant\nadvancements in our understanding of these processes. However, culturing iPSC-derived neurons in vitro\nremains technically challenging. Neurons grown in cell autonomous systems exhibit insufficient levels of\nmorphological maturation, synaptic connectivity, metabolic function, and electrophysiological activity, while\ntranscriptional analyses suggest they resemble neurons of late embryonic to early postnatal stages hindering\nthe study of adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesize that the lack of a physiological,\ndevelopmentally appropriate extracellular matrix (ECM) platform is a major contributor to these limitations. The\nECM is an intricately organized intercellular scaffold of secreted proteins and complex sugars that configures\nspatiotemporal microenvironments throughout the CNS. It provides critical structural support to neurons,\nastrocytes, and glial cells, serves as a reservoir for soluble factors, and mediates cellular signaling. Through\nthese actions, the ECM can modulate neuronal development, maturation, and aging. However, the temporal\ndiversity and functional effects of the matrisome, defined as the ensemble of the ECM and ECM-associated\nproteins, in the CNS is poorly characterized. As a result, the design of in vitro platforms for culturing iPSC-derived\nneurons that truly recapitulate the physiological ECM is impossible. Here, we will refine iPSC-neuronal model\nsystems by providing developmentally appropriate ECM cues. In Aim 1 we will utilize biochemical purification\nand quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics to define the composition and nature of remodeling\nof the in vivo matrisome from extracted mouse spinal cords at 3 developmental stages (postnatal, adult, old). In\nAim 2 we will leverage our combined expertise in iPSC technologies and biomaterials to establish ECM mimetic\nmatrices that can recapitulate the architecture and modulatory activity of the physiological matrisome to facilitate\nthe maturation and aging of stem cell derived spinal motor neurons in vitro. In Aim 3 we will improve the\ndevelopment and reproducibility of 3-D spinal organoids by growing them in structured scaffolds with\nincorporated candidate ECM cues. Our proposed aims will shed light into the contribution of the temporal\nmatrisome on neuronal diversity, development and function and facilitate the establishment of physiological\niPSC-based spinal cord model systems.",

For more than a decade, G.\nsulfurreducens nanowires were thought to be bacterial type IV pili, supported by many indirect genetic and\nbiochemical observations. Recently we showed that these conductive nanowires are not made of type IV pilins.\nInstead, these structures are a polymerized multi-heme c-type cytochrome, OmcS, which have never been\ncharacterized before. The OmcS filament model is consistent with the known roles of OmcS in Geobacter\nrespiration, but our knowledge of cytochrome appendages is still very limited. This study aims at addressing\nfundamental scientific questions about cytochrome filaments in respiring prokaryotes as well as applying our\ndiscoveries into the general medical field. Specifically, I will: A) identify and characterize novel cytochrome\nfilaments in bacterial and archaeal strains, through bioinformatics algorithms followed by microscopic validation.\nB) Then I will study the conduction mechanism of these filaments by high resolution cryogenic electron\nmicroscopy (cryo-EM) and conductivity measurement. C) Finally, based on these new insights into cytochrome\nfilaments, I will create a novel design for a self-assembled conductive nanowire. These nanowires may be\nderived directly from a novel cytochrome filament or may contain a peptide/protein based self-assembled scaffold\ncore with soluble cytochromes appended to the outer surface. The results will advance our understanding of\ncytochrome nanowires, as well as generating self-assembling nanowire scaffolds that may be used in many\nfuture biomedical applications.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nAging is associated with increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation (AF). While AF affects <0.2% of people\nunder 49 years old, it occurs in ~6% of those over age 65 and ~9-17% in those over age 80. AF is associated\nwith increased morbidity and mortality through stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure and is\ncharacterized by abnormal and rapid atrial electrical activity that arises due to adverse electrophysiological, Ca2+-\nhandling, structural, and autonomic remodeling. Despite age being a risk factor for the development of AF, how\nnatural age-associated remodeling makes the atria more susceptible to arrhythmias is not fully understood. An\nadditional layer of complexity is derived from potential sex differences in etiology. While males develop AF at an\nearlier age, women with AF have worse symptoms, poor treatment outcomes and higher mortality. These\ndifferences in the disease state may be reflective of sex differences in baseline atrial electrophysiology and the\nage-associated remodeling that predisposes to AF. However, due to historic underrepresentation of females in\nscientific and preclinical studies, sex differences in atrial electrophysiology associated with natural aging are\ncurrently unclear. In line with the goals of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) to better understand the biology\nof aging and disparities in age-related disease, the aim of this R03 Small Research Grant is to investigate sex\ndifferences in atrial electrophysiological, structural, and autonomic remodeling in aging to determine how\nbiological differences in healthy aging may be predictive of arrhythmia risk. To do this, we will use a\ntranslationally-relevant \u2018middle-aged\u2019 rabbit model that demonstrates age-associated changes that predispose\nto AF, but is a timepoint before late-stage remodeling. We will take an integrative approach performing functional\nin vivo, ex vivo and biochemical studies on 3-4 year old male and female rabbit hearts alongside complementary\ncomputational modeling. Aim 1 will examine sex-specific electrophysiological characteristics and arrhythmia\nsusceptibility in the middle-aged atria through optical mapping, in vivo ECG recording, and quantification of\nprotein expression and fibrosis. Aim 2 will examine changes in autonomic modulation in middle-age and its role\nin atrial arrhythmogenesis. Aim 3 will investigate ionic parameters that may predict arrhythmia risk. Together,\nthese experiments will characterize electrophysiological and autonomic changes in aging, evaluate age-\ndependent arrhythmogenic mechanisms, and uncover novel predictive features underlying the transition from\nhealthy aging to AF.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and its reduced form NADH, play crucial roles in maintaining tissue\nhomeostasis. We now know that NAD+ and NADH concentrations differ in different parts of the cell by orders of\nmagnitude. Nevertheless, how these distinct cellular pools of NAD+/NADH enable compartment specific\nmetabolic and regulatory functions, ensuring coordination of various cellular processes remains elusive.\nNAD+/NADH compartmentalization is particularly important for the kidneys, in which tubule cells perform the\nhigh-energy demanding task of reclaiming solutes filtered from the bloodstream and eliminating waste products\nthrough urine. In acute kidney injury (AKI), a common condition in elderly patients, substantial decreases in the\nlevels of NAD+ impair energy generation in tubular epithelial cells leading to critical loss of cellular and organismal\nhomeostasis. Patients who survive AKI frequently develop chronic kidney disease (CKD), a condition\ncharacterized by kidney fibrosis and inflammation leading to deleterious systemic effects. We and others have\nshown that NAD+ boosting by cytoprotective approaches protects the kidney tubules against ischemia and other\ninsults. Furthermore, several experimental studies have demonstrated protective role for NAD+ precursor\nsupplementation against aging and AKI but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In particular, while the\ncellular NAD+/NADH ratio is critical for energy metabolism, the extent to which it reflects versus drives metabolic\nphysiology in vivo is poorly understood. To successfully translate NAD-based therapeutics in humans, it is\nessential to understand the molecular mechanisms by which this metabolite regulates kidney health. To this end,\nrecent technological advances that allow genetic manipulation of NAD+ in different cellular compartments, have\nuncovered an exciting potential for revealing the multi-faceted effects of this fascinating molecule. The goal of\nthis proposal is to identify novel mechanisms by which directly increasing the NAD+/NADH promotes kidney\nhealth in the context of injury and aging. To this end, we propose in vivo expression of Lactobacillus brevis\n(Lb)NOX, a bacterial water forming NADH oxidase, in the cytosol or mitochondrial of kidney tubular cells. Two\nspecific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will determine how boosting mitochondrial NAD+/NADH ratio in tubular\nepithelial cells regulates kidney health following ischemic kidney injury. Aim 2 will define the role of boosting\ncytosolic NAD+/NADH in tubular epithelial cells as a regulator of kidney health following ischemic kidney injury.\nCompletion of this project will generate exciting new insights in kidney biology and enable the development of\nurgently needed novel therapeutics that protect kidney health.",

Furthermore, interviews will be conducted with NH staff and legal authorized representatives of\npatients with dementia to gain insight into the potential use and challenges of implementing RF sensors to help\nin the detection and prediction of respiratory distress in patients with advanced ADRD.\nEnvironment: The study team is a distinguished group with expertise in geriatrics, palliative medicine,\npulmonary medicine, and biosensor technology/artificial intelligence.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe cardiac conduction system (CCS) is specialized in the generation and propagation of electrical impulses\nfrom the atria to the ventricles to produce a highly coordinated muscle contraction. Cardiac conduction disorders\n(CCDs) including sick sinus syndrome, atrioventricular block (AVB), and bundle branch block are common\narrhythmic disorders that impact the contraction of atria or ventricles. Cardiac pacing is the standard treatment\nfor patients with symptomatic bradyarrhythmia resulting in implantation of over 600,000 pacemakers annually in\nUS due to sinus node dysfunction (SND) or AVB. Currently, there is no alternative treatment for these patients.\nThus, understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to CCD may provide a foundation for new\ntherapeutic strategies. A nonsense mutation (c.C673>T, p.R225>X) in lamin A/C (LMNA) identified in a kindred,\nwas associated progressive CCD and atrial arrhythmias, preceding the development of cardiomyopathy and\nheart failure. The mechanistic link between mutated lamin A/C and CCD is largely undetermined. Preliminary\nresults suggest that the LMNA-R255X knockin mice develop CCD phenotype, similar to patient carriers of R225X\nmutation. The proposed work will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which mutation in lamin A/C promote\nCCD. Our study will establish the pathological function of lamin A/C in CCD development. The molecular\npathways uncovered from this study will likely have a broader impact on our understanding of the molecular\nmechanisms of CCD in the general population.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary:\nPulmonary hypertension (PH) is a cardiovascular disorder characterized by high mortality, primarily due to right\nventricular (RV) failure (RVF) caused by increased pulmonary vascular resistance. RV fibrosis, a hallmark of\ndecompensated RVF, lacks targeted therapies, highlighting the need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms\nunderlying RV fibrosis and dysfunction.\nOur research focuses on the role of alternative polyadenylation (APA), a process associated with excessive\nproduction of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, in RV fibrosis. APA shortens the 3' untranslated region (UTR)\nof transcripts, leading to loss of microRNA binding sites and increased transcript stability. We have identified\nCleavage and Polyadenylation Specific Factor 6 (CPSF6), a key regulator of APA, as being involved in end-\nstage RVF. In RVF patients, CPSF6 exhibits lengthened 3' UTR and decreased protein expression. Silencing\nCPSF6 in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) results in 3' UTR shortening and upregulation of major fibrotic mediators,\nincluding TGF-\u03b21 and its receptor, TGF\u03b2R1. Pathway analysis further supports 3' UTR shortening in mRNAs\nencoding ECM proteins in CPSF6 knockdown CFs. Additionally, we have discovered the role of 4-hydroxy-2-\nnonenal (4HNE), a reactive aldehyde generated during oxidative stress, in RVF. Increased 4HNE downregulates\nCPSF6, inducing 3' UTR shortening in profibrotic genes and promoting RV fibrosis. The proposed research aims\nto investigate these mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets for mitigating RV fibrosis. Our hypothesis posits\nthat CPSF6 depletion shortens the 3' UTRs of ECM genes, causing their escape from regulation, promoting their\nexpression, and leading to RV fibrosis. Specifically, we will: Investigate the impact of CPSF6 loss on the 3' UTR\nlandscape and profibrotic gene expression in RVF (Specific Aim 1). Uncover the mechanism underlying CPSF6\nreduction-dependent 3' UTR shortening in CFs and its functional consequences in RVF (Specific Aim 2).

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nHeart failure in the presence of diabetes is common, expensive, and growing in significance, with some\nestimates suggesting that diabetic cardiomyopathy is present in up to 60% of patients with diabetes. While\ntypically thought of as a disease of the left ventricle, right ventricular (RV) remodeling also occurs and\ncontributes to disease pathogenesis. In multiple clinical conditions, RV dysfunction is the strongest predictor of\nmortality, clearly highlighting the significance of maintaining RV function. Despite the strong link between RV\nfunction and survival, understanding of the diabetic RV is limited and thus there is a critical need to identify\nmechanisms of RV-specific remodeling in the diabetic heart. In the setting of diabetes, altered myocardial\nsubstrate metabolism causes oxidative stress, which together contribute to LV dysfunction. However, despite\nstrong rationale for these mechanisms in the diabetic LV, they are unstudied in the RV. The purpose of this\nKatz Early Stage Investigator proposal is to identify RV-specific mechanisms of diabetic myopathy. To achieve\nthis goal, we propose to 1) determine the mechanism by which fatty acid uptake contributes to RV lipotoxicity\nand dysfunction, and 2) identify mechanisms of impaired reactive oxygen species signaling in the diabetic RV.\nTogether, we will demonstrate that RV dysfunction is significant in diabetes by a mechanism involving\nlipotoxicity and oxidative stress. Identifying RV-centric mechanisms of disease is critical to advance our long-\nterm goal of identifying treatments for the failing RV. If RV mechanisms are distinct from those in the LV, then\ncurrent therapeutic approaches will be limited in improving RV function and patient outcomes. This novel and\ninnovative body of work will lay the groundwork for future larger efforts aimed at understanding the\nmechanisms of diabetic RV cardiomyopathy and the identification of therapies for this unmet public health\nneed.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nEarly-onset spinal deformity is a subset of pediatric spinal deformity that begins before the age of 10 years.\nUnlike adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, it is a life-threatening disease, which makes early intervention crucial.\nSurgical intervention must accommodate the growth of the developing spine, making this one of the most\nchallenging orthopedic conditions to treat. Current intra-spinal based treatments, such as growing rods with\npedicle screw fixation, have high complication rates and limited effectiveness. The R-FIX (Rib-FIXation) Spinal\nGrowth System is an alternative extra-spinal technique that uses rib-based fixation for correcting early-onset\nspinal deformity. This extra-spinal rib fixation is a paradigm shift from seeking correction of the spine to\nemphasizing correction of thorax malalignment. The R-FIX System originated from a bioengineering lab (one of\nthe applicants' labs) at Clemson University and has been further developed by Apex Orthopaedic Technologies.\nThe R-FIX Spinal Growth System has been granted breakthrough device designation by the FDA. The objective\nof this SBIR Phase II award is threefold: 1) complete the final design, manufacturing, and quality control\nprocesses for the new R-FIX System components, 2) obtain the necessary biomechanical, biocompatibility, and\nsterility data resulting in successful 510(k) clearance of the R-FIX System, and 3) demonstrate the safety and\nefficacy of new R-FIX uni-axial rib hook and rib band designs in an animal model. This research will be conducted\nover 24 months and the data obtained from this grant proposal will result in a 510(k) application for FDA\nclearance and follow-up NIAMS pediatric medical device initiative clinical trial application. Major milestones to\nbe achieved with this grant include 1) validation of new implantable R-FIX components with surgeon feedback,\n2) completion of benchtop performance testing and FDA 510(k) submission, and 3) assessment of the safety\nand efficacy of new R-FIX components compared to pedicle screws in a pediatric hyperkyphosis porcine animal\nmodel.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Abstract\nCongenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect with complex CHD causing significant morbidity/\nmortality. Therapies targeting adult heart failure have been ineffective in treating heart failure in patients with CHD,\nwhich implies different pathomechanisms of congestive heart failure in patients with CHD compared with those with\nstructurally normal hearts. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the genetic basis of CHDs. Genetic analysis\nin CHD patients is confounded by the genetic heterogeneity of the human population. Hence, we used large-scale\nchemical/N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis in inbred mice to recover mutations that cause CHD. We recovered\nmutations in ten vesicular/endocytic trafficking proteins, including a missense mutation (C4232R) in the highly\nconserved epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeat domain encoding low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1\n(LRP1). All Lrp1m/m mutant mice exhibited CHD comprising outflow tract (OFT) malalignment defects and/or\natrioventricular (AV) septal defects. Conditional knockout of Lrp1 in different cell lineages that are crucial in cardiac\ndevelopment demonstrated ablation of cardiac neural crest cells (CNCC) using Wnt1-Cre driver recapitulate the\nphenotypes of ENU-induced mutants. Interestingly, these Cre deletion experiments also showed Lrp1 deficiency in\nother cell lineages along the CNCC migratory path generated with Nkx2-5+/cre, Tie2+/cre also yielded either double outlet\nright ventricle (DORV), atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), or ventricular septal defect (VSD) phenotypes. As these are\nobserved with variable penetrance, they suggest CNCC migration to the heart is supported by redundant signaling to\nensure high fidelity of CNCC deployment to the heart. In addition, the combined double knockout of Nkx2-5+/cre Tie2+/cre:\nLrp1f/f mutants demonstrated synergistic effects which reflect the complex genetics in human CHD. Based on findings\nfrom a large body of preliminary data, we hypothesize that LRP1 is required in the cardiac neural crest lineage and its\nmigratory path for proper OFT alignment and development of the atrioventricular cushions (AVC). We will investigate\nthis with a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments conducted using Wnt1+/cre: Lrp1f/f mutant mice with Lrp1\ndeletion targeted to the CNCCs and double knockout of Nkx2-5+/cre Tie2+/cre: Lrp1f/f mutants. First, we will investigate the\ndeployment of CNCCs with in vitro migration studies in combination with in vivo cell lineage fate mapping analysis (Aim\n1). We will further investigate the cellular and molecular basis for how Lrp1 deficiency in CNCCs can lead to OFT and AV\nvalve defects by conducting single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, as well as in vivo and in vitro analysis of endocytic\ntrafficking (Aim 2). This will include the examination of endocytic trafficking related to cell signaling pathways identified\nin the CNCC and its migratory path. We will also investigate the clinical relevance of LRP1 mutations in human CHD by\ngenerating CRISPR gene-edited mice bearing LRP1 mutations recovered from CHD patients (Aim 3). This will include an\nanalysis of heterozygous mutations to assess a dominant genetic model of disease, as well as compound heterozygous\nmutations to investigate a recessive genetic model of disease. Together, these studies will provide novel mechanistic\ninsights into the role of endocytic trafficking in the pathogenesis of human CHD.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and accounts for 1 in every 5 deaths.\nSudden cardiac death is responsible for nearly half of all heart disease related mortality and is often attributed\nto the occurrence of lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular arrhythmias also are a major source of morbidity\nand mortality in patients with structural heart disease. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy provides only limited efficacy\nin preventing ventricular arrhythmias and while implantable cardioverter defibrillators provide life-saving therapy\nto terminate the arrhythmia once it has occurred, they do not prevent them from occurring. For these reasons,\ncatheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias has emerged as an additional therapy for many patients with\nrefractory ventricular tachycardia (VT). However, VT ablation procedures are complex and multiple procedures\nare often required to achieve modest long-term success. Therefore, there is a critical need for additional VT\ntherapies. Cardiac stereotactic body radiation therapy (cSBRT) has emerged as an adjunctive noninvasive\napproach that can be utilized to treat patients with VT that is refractory to standard antiarrhythmic drug therapy\nand catheter ablation with clinical efficacy observed in some very complex patients. However, the clinical\nresponse following cSBRT has been highly variable and the electrophysiologic mechanism is unclear. We\nbelieve that better understanding the mechanisms of cSBRT will help refine and guide clinical cSBRT paradigms,\noptimize patient selection, and better define the appropriate role this therapy should have in clinical practice. We\npropose a series of experiments to investigate the association between cSBRT dose and structural and\nelectrophysiologic changes using longitudinal cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and high-resolution\nelectroanatomic mapping in a large animal model of chronic myocardial infarction and reentrant VT. In Aim 1,\nwe will investigate the impact of cSBRT dose (15Gy, 25Gy, and 35Gy) at short and intermediate follow-up\ntimepoints. We will also investigate the long-term impact of cSBRT delivered at the dose currently used clinically\n(25Gy) out to 1 year. In Aim 2, we will similarly investigate structural and electrophysiologic changes that occur\nin patients undergoing clinically indicated cSBRT compared to catheter ablation. This study will give a new\nunderstanding of the dose and time relationship of cSBRT on the heart that will be essential in moving this field\nforward.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract\nAutoChamber is part of an initiative spearheaded by HeartLung.AI, in collaboration with a team of esteemed\nphysician researchers from leading US academic institutions. The AI tool is designed to opportunistically\nscreen existing chest CT scans stored in hospital PACS or new scans obtained for any medical evaluations\nsuch as coronary artery calcium scan, lung cancer screening or diagnostic work ups following accidents or\npneumonia and such, to detect asymptomatic enlarged cardiac chambers and thick left ventricular wall without\nany X-ray contrast enhanced agent. The human eye cannot distinguish between the inside of cardiac\nchambers and the cardiac wall without contrast enhanced agent whereas, the AutoChamber AI which was\ntrained using contrast-enhanced cardiac CT scans can accurately detect and measure cardiac chambers\nvolume and left ventricular wall mass. The project underscores a significant stride towards addressing the\nunmet needs in early detection and prevention of heart failure and stroke, potentially saving lives, and reducing\nhealthcare costs. It aligns with the mission of fostering innovative solutions that offer opportunistic diagnoses\nusing existing CT scans or CT scans obtained for other reasons unrelated to cardiovascular disease. Over 76\nmillion CT scans were performed in the United States in 2019, an estimated 230 CT procedures per 1,000\npeople with chest CT accounting for 12.7 million that can be used for AutoChamber\u2122 screening.\nAutoChamber\u2122 is the newest AI technology that has received a Medical Device Breakthrough Designation\nfrom the FDA as recently as August 30, 2023.\nBuilding upon the encouraging results gleaned from the MESA database, the project aims to extend its\nresearch to the Framingham Heart Study database, the largest prospective cohort study of cardiovascular\ndiseases with a rich repository of thousands of CT scans to further validate the performance of\nAutoChamber\u2122.\nThe project delineates three specific aims:\nAim 1: To apply AutoChamber\u2122 on CAC scans from the Framingham database and compare the cardiac\nchamber volume measurements with those obtained from contrast-enhanced MRI.\nAim 2 To evaluate the performance of AutoChamber\u2122 in predicting incidents of atrial fibrillation and stroke,\nbenchmarking against existing standards like the CHARGE-AF Score and CHADS-VASc Score.\nAim 3 To assess the capability of AutoChamber\u2122 in detecting prevalent left ventricular hypertrophy and\nasymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, and predicting incidents of heart failure, using parameters like left\nventricular and left ventricular wall volumetry.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "The search for molecular targets and pathways that can be manipulated to improve bone properties is a highly\nactive area of investigation. Recently, particular interest has been expressed in targeting biomolecules that can\naugment mechanical signaling in bone; the next generation of osteoporosis drugs is likely to work in conjunction\nwith physical activity/loading in order to disproportionately direct new bone formation to the skeletal loci that need\nit most (i.e., those loci that endure the greatest strains and are at the greatest risk of failure). The WNT signaling\npathway has emerged as a key regulator of bone mass and strength, but also of bone cell mechanotransduction.\nRecent clinical approval of the osteoporosis therapy Evenity\u2122 (i.e., Romosozumab-aqqg) has highlighted the utility\nand potency of targeting the WNT pathway to improve skeletal properties and fracture resistance. However, the\nFDA issued a black-box label to the product because of its side effects on cardiovascular function and health. Recent\nwork suggests that the effects of WNT stimulation on bone formation can be isolated from those on cardiovascular\nfunction, but the molecular mechanisms driving these disparate processes are completely unknown. The\ngoal of the present is application is to understand precisely how LRP5 and LRP6--two structurally related cell surface\nproteins that function as WNT co-receptors--differ in their skeletal and non-skeletal contexts, with the goal of\nexploiting signaling differences to improve clinically based WNT therapeutic outcomes (e.g., sclerostin inhibition).\nAmong the key questions addressed are: (1) Do LRP5 and LRP6 exhibit different predilection, or selectivity, to different\nWNT ligands in bone cells in vivo? (2) Does LRP5 activation trigger different downstream signaling networks\nthan activated LRP6? (3) Is LRP6 involved in mechanotransduction in bone (overuse and/or disuse)? (4)\nCan activation of LRP5 alone (through sclerostin antibody-mediated inhibition or by gain-of-function mutation in\nthe receptor) improve bone properties to a greater extent than activation of LRP6 alone? and (5) Are cardiovascular\neffects differentially affected by LRP5 vs LRP6 signaling (in isolation)? We will use cutting-edge mouse models,\nmicroscopic techniques, single cell and spatial transcriptomic approaches, mechanotransduction models, and radiographic/\nhistologic/biochemical approaches to reveal the underlying biology and therapeutic potential/differences\nof LRP5 and LRP6 in bone tissue. The project is a continuation of the close collaboration between the Robling\n(Indiana University) and Warman (Harvard University) labs, an extremely fruitful partnership for more than 18 yrs.\nWe have assembled a unique combination of expertise, resources, biological models and tools, and technical innovation\nto elucidate, distinguish, and exploit the differing roles of LRP5 and LRP6 in bone biology and disease.\nProject Summary/Abstract",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Effectiveness of Therapies for Heart Failure with Mid-Range Ejection Fraction",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary / Abstract\n Evidence from trials has established that 4 separate classes of guideline-directed medical therapies\n(GDMT) for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) together reduce mortality by nearly two-thirds.\nConversely, for heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF), trials have produced only weaker\nevidence, resulting in ambiguous guidelines. Our long-term goal is to build the largest echocardiography\nregistry in the world to generate comparative effectiveness evidence for questions for specific populations in\nheart failure where trials have not been able to provide strong evidence. The overall objectives in this\napplication are to build the registry, test mathematical assumptions required for the application of strong causal\ninference methods developed in economics, and then apply the strongest methods possible to measure\ntreatment effects for GDMT in HFmrEF. The central hypothesis is that \u201creal-world\u201d treatment decisions will\ndiffer at guideline-suggested thresholds of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and patients on either side\nof those immediate LVEF thresholds will be otherwise similar (\u201cas good as random\u201d), allowing the application of\nregression discontinuity methods to measure treatment effects. We believe these methods will demonstrate\nreduced mortality with GDMT for patients with HFmrEF. The rationale for this proposal is that (1) LVEF cutoffs\nin guidelines are semi-arbitrary in the sense that LVEF exists on a physiological continuum but guideline\ncutoffs are based on strict thresholds, and (2) our preliminary data demonstrates expected discontinuities in\ntreatment frequency at influential LVEF thresholds for other HF therapies (defibrillators) in real-world practice.\nAs such, the conditions for \u201cas good as random\u201d likely exist in small ranges around relevant LVEF thresholds,\nallowing the application of regression discontinuity methods. Our central hypothesis will be tested with 2\nspecific aims. In Aim #1, we will use natural language processing to aggregate data from echocardiography\nreports from 11 hospitals creating the largest echocardiography registry in the world, allowing clinical\nadjudication of both clinical information and echocardiographic images. We will then systematically test\nmathematical assumptions required for regression discontinuity. In Aim #2, we will create robust estimates of\neach of the effects of each GDMT medication class on mortality in HFmrEF with fuzzy RDD and alternative\nmethods, including propensity score methods. The feasibility of propensity score methods does not depend on\nthe Aim 1 analyses, so at least 1 of the 2 proposed methods will be feasible. We therefore expect that these\nresults will upgrade evidence from the current class 2b (\u201cusefulness is unknown\u201d) in heart failure guidelines for\n3 of the 4 GDMT medication classes. We think the proposed research is innovative because it combines\nstrong causal inference methods to observational data with the adjudication standards of trials to fill in\nunanswered gaps in evidence. The research proposed here is significant because it will upgrade the current\nambiguous treatment guidelines for HFmrEF in ways that will reduce mortality for this growing population.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThis proposal seeks to enhance our understanding of new-onset diabetes in individuals with COVID-19 by\nexploring social determinants of health and underlying biology. Both diabetes and COVID-19 disproportionately\naffect individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups. Further, these individuals experience worse clinical\noutcomes, including higher rates of mortality compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Some have suggested these\nobservations may be due to differences in comorbidities, home/work environment, or access to care. This study\nwill investigate the 1) prevalence of new-onset diabetes in COVID-19; 2) how social determinants of health\ninfluence health outcomes; and 3) the genetic likelihood of developing diabetes. Study results will not only help\nidentify high risk populations, but will also contribute to enhancing health equity, reducing disparities, and\npromoting better health outcomes. The proposed work will use quantitative methods to address the question.\nWe will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the true prevalence of new-onset diabetes\nin individuals diagnosed with COVID-19. Additionally, we will use prospective survey data from the All of Us\ndatabase to determine salient factors related to social determinants of health and health outcomes. Last, we will\nuse the All of Us database to conduct genome-wide-association studies and calculate the risk score for diabetes\nand COVID-19 to examine underlying biologic risk of developing new-onset diabetes. The training plan for this\nfellowship includes a variety of opportunities to develop and apply knowledge in social determinants of health\nand analytic skills as well as professional development activities aimed at nurturing a well-rounded nurse\nscientist. Training opportunities include structured and experiential learning activities to develop substantive and\nmethodological knowledge. Interdisciplinary team-based research experiences and mentorship will complement\nformal and experiential learning opportunities. A strong mentoring team has been assembled with\ncomplementary experts in endocrinology/diabetes, social determinants of health, and statistical analysis. The\nproposed study and study sponsors are supported by the institutional environment of Boston College Connell\nSchool of Nursing which has significant resources to support the proposed project. The mentoring team and\ninstitutional environment are well-suited for the successful completion of the proposed project and training plan\nfor this fellowship. This study addresses the NINR\u2019s research lens of advancing health equity and social\ndeterminants of health research. The proposed work will elucidate the intersection of social and environmental\nfactors with biologic risk factors and their impact on health outcomes. Findings will inform a holistic approach to\nunderstanding health disparities and advancing health equity among racial and ethnic minorities affected by\ndiabetes and COVID-19",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Heart failure (HF) disproportionately affects the elderly who predominantly develop HF with preserved left\nventricular (LV) ejection fraction (HFpEF), for which no efficacious therapies exist. Pulmonary hypertension\n(PH) \u2013 the most clinically recognized expression of pulmonary vascular dysfunction (PVD) \u2013 is a risk factor for\nincident HF and is present in upto 83% of patients with prevalent HFpEF, among whom it portends worse\noutcomes. PVD is therefore an attractive therapeutic target in HFpEF, but its pathophysiology is complex with\nvariable contributions from elevated left atrial pressure, pulmonary parenchymal injury, and intrinsic\npulmonary vascular dysfunction. A critical barrier to understanding PVD in HFpEF is a lack of knowledge\nregarding the anatomic alterations in the pulmonary vasculature underlying abnormal hemodynamics. The\ninvestigative team has pioneered development and validation of advanced image processing pipelines to\nquantify pulmonary venous and arterial remodeling on non-contrast chest computerized tomography (CT)\nscans. Their published and preliminary data from smokers in the NHLBI-funded COPDGene study show that\npulmonary vascular remodeling associates with RV dysfunction and worse functional capacity, and is more\nfrequently observed in HF. They now propose to extend these findings to a community-based cohort of older\nadults to define the role of pulmonary vascular remodeling in the development of HFpEF. This proposal\u2019s\ncentral hypothesis is that activation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways promotes pulmonary\nvascular remodeling, partially via concomitant LV dysfunction and pulmonary parenchymal injury, leading to\nPH, RV dysfunction, and ultimately HF. This project will leverage recently completed chest CT (for CAC) and\nechocardiography in 1,579 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study participants at the 7th study visit\n(2/2018-11/2019; age ~81\u00b14 yrs). Novel CT-based measures of pulmonary vascular remodeling and\nparenchymal injury (fibrotic, emphysematous), and advanced 3D and strain-based echo measures of RV\nfunction will be performed. These data will be integrated with clinical assessments, outcomes surveillance,\naptamer-based proteomics, and genomics to help define the most relevant targets to prevent progressive PVD\nin the very elderly. Specific aims include: (1) Define the extent to which LV dysfunction and pulmonary\nparenchymal injury promote pulmonary venous and arterial remodeling in the very elderly; (2) Determine the\nextent to which pulmonary vascular remodeling predicts RV dysfunction, reduced functional capacity, and\nincident HFpEF; and (3) Identify proteins and protein networks that predict pulmonary vascular remodeling.\nReplication will occur in COPDGene and the Framingham Heart Study, and Mendelian randomization analyses\nwill identify the subset of potentially causal associations. Quantifying pulmonary vascular remodeling will\nidentify pathophysiologically distinct morphologic PVD sub-phenotypes enabling more precise application of\nexisting therapies, while discovery of associated molecular pathways may inform novel therapeutic targets.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Role of SuPAR in the Intersection between Cardiovascular and Kidney Disease",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nPeople with chronic kidney disease (CKD), who represent over 15% of the population of the United States,\nsuffer a disproportionately high burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for reasons that are poorly\nunderstood. Inflammation represents the major pathophysiologic process common to both atherosclerosis and\nCKD. Recently, a novel pathway of inflammation was uncovered linking both CVD and CKD to bone marrow\nmyeloid cells which produce a circulating signaling molecule: soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor\n(suPAR). SuPAR is released by immature myeloid cells in response to environmental exposures and CVD risk\nfactors. In circulation, suPAR alters glomerular and tubular function, with chronic exposure leading to\nprogressive kidney dysfunction. Pharmacologic inhibition of suPAR in experimental models prevented kidney\ninjury. SuPAR levels also predict adverse cardiovascular outcomes independently of kidney function, and\noutperform well-established markers of CVD risk, such as coronary calcium, C-reactive protein, high sensitivity\ntroponin I and B-type natriuretic peptide. These compelling data reveal the potential for suPAR not only as an\nexcellent biomarker of risk, but also as a promising therapeutic target. The role of suPAR in CVD is however\npoorly understood. The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate suPAR\u2019s potential causal role in the\nprogression of atherosclerosis and its link to decline in kidney function through epidemiologic insights. We will\nachieve this goal by leveraging three of the most significant contributions to cardiovascular science: the\nlandmark Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA); an NIH-funded prospective cohort in which enrollees\nunderwent serial measurements of subclinical markers of atherosclerosis, the JUPITER trial, in which\nparticipants with high C-reactive protein levels were randomized to statin or placebo, and the UK Biobank, a\ndata repository of over 500,000 volunteers. SuPAR levels will be measured in 5,620 participants of MESA to\ndetermine whether levels correlate with early markers of CVD and predicts their progression independently of a\ndecline in kidney function. To assess potential causality, a gene-wide association study of suPAR levels in\nMESA, followed by a Mendelian randomization analysis in the UK Biobank dataset will connect genetic\ndeterminants of suPAR levels to CVD and CKD. Lastly, to establish whether suPAR is a modifiable risk factor\nfor CVD, levels will be measured serially in participants of the JUPITER trial randomized to rosuvastatin\n(n=200) or placebo (n=200), and the change in suPAR will be compared between groups. Whether the benefits\nof statins are dependent on suPAR levels will be assessed in the MESA cohort by comparing the survival of\nparticipants started on statins across suPAR quartiles, and determining whether suPAR is a modifier of the\nassociation between statins and outcomes. The proposed research has the potential to address the unmet\nneed of close to 50 million people with CKD in the United States alone, identifying sorely needed therapeutic\ntargets and management strategies in a field that has long been stagnant.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nThe CNBD family of channels, encompassing hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) and\ndepolarization-activated KCNH members, plays a pivotal role in shaping the electrical properties of the heart.\nThe modulation of HCN channels presents a promising therapeutic avenue for the management of atrial and\nventricular arrhythmias by influencing the activity of the sinoatrial node pacemaker. In addition, the human\nKCNH2 potassium channel (hERG) gene is linked to long QT syndrome (LQTS), an inherited cardiac condition\nthat substantially escalates the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. HCN and KCNH\nchannels share structural features, most notably their voltage-sensing domains (VSD). However, they display\ndivergent channel gating behaviors. Up to this point, a comprehensive mechanism that adequately explains the\ndiversity in their voltage-dependent gating has remained elusive. In particular, the VSD of HCN channels\nundergoes distinct conformational changes during activation, whose dynamics, nature of intermediate\nconformational states, and couplings to other domains remain largely uncharacterized. Moreover, like mutations\naffecting the VSD of HCN channels, we recently uncovered that several LQTS-linked mutations the S4 helix\nvoltage sensor of hERG channels lead to distinctively altered voltage-dependent activation profiles. The\nunderlying mechanism of these disease-causing gating alterations remains unexplored, yet it is central to our\nunderstanding of the mechanism of cardiac diseases related to CNBD channels. The overarching objective of\nthis application is to determine the VSD dynamics of recombinant CNBD channels expressed in human cell lines,\nusing an array of concerted biophysical techniques. We will improve the patch-clamp fluorometry (PCF) method\nto study the structure-function correlation of cardiac voltage-gated channels, paving the way to new treatments\nof myocardial diseases. Our primary goals also include studying how pivotal regulatory domains modulate\nchannel gating by altering VSD conformations. To quantitatively assess voltage-dependent structural\nrearrangements, we will leverage transition metal ion F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (tmFRET), noncanonical\namino acid integration, and click chemistry for site-specific fluorescence labeling. This strategy will enable us to\nprecisely translate FRET efficiencies into interatomic distances. In parallel, phasor-plot fluorescence lifetime\nimaging (FLIM) in conjunction with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations will be used to quantify the underlying\nstructural dynamics. Collectively, the proposed studies will delineate the energetics, allostery, and structural\nfoundations of cardiac pacemaking ion channels.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Proactive Dual-Irrigation Cardiac Chest Tube to Maintain Postoperative Patency",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nOver 455k cardiac procedures annually rely on chest tubes to drain blood from surgical wounds. However, dated\nchest drainage technologies result in significant issues\u201436% of tubes clog with blood, leading to complications\nin 17% of patients due to incomplete drainage. Hospitals spend approximately $9,617 per patient on these\ncomplications, totaling a yearly economic burden surpassing $2B in the US alone. The current practice of milking\nand stripping chest tubes is both labor-intensive and potentially risky, often leading to missed clots that\ncompromise tube patency and patient adverse outcomes.\nCirculaTech\u2019s ThoraFlush is a proactive clot preventing chest tube which utilizes proprietary dual irrigation\ntechnology to sustain drainage patency. ThoraFlush integrates seamlessly with hospital IV pumps to irrigate the\nchest tube with saline, obviating the labor-intensive manual manipulation, and automating chest tube\nmaintenance. ThoraFlush saves nurses time and effort in maintaining chest tubes, reduces hospital costs linked\nto tube blockages, and promotes faster, smoother patient recovery with fewer complications.\nThis NIH proposal will complete the following AIMs: 1) Optimize ThoraFlush\u2019s efficacy of drainage patency in a\nmediastinum blood coagulation model (MBCM). 2) Sustaining ThoraFlush\u2019s drainage volume in an in vivo model,\nsuperior than the standard of care.\nIn AIM 1, the team will use an in vitro bench top mediastinum blood coagulation model, known as the MBCM to\nproduce a functioning ThoraFlush prototype. The MBCM is hypothesized to be more rigorous than clinical\npractice due to its use of hypercoagulable porcine blood and mediastinal model geometries/materials promoting\naccelerated blood clot formation. Achieving a 6 hour benchmark of retaining device patency will prove\nsignificance to move to conducting AIM 2.\nIn AIM 2, the team will translate their work in Aim 1 to animal testing using male Yorkshire Breed pigs to assess\nThoraFlush's efficacy in live animals. The study involves a simulated heart surgery, replicating common cardiac\nprocedures. This approach aims to comprehensively evaluate ThoraFlush's performance in a relevant\nphysiological context. This model also proves as a first of its kind, mediastinum in vivo model for post-surgical\nrecovery.\nUltimately, the outcomes of this proposal will develop and prove that ThoraFlush meets patency requirements in\nthe MBCM and show\u2019s superior performance in an in vivo study, promoting its next stages into commercialization\nof the device.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nMortality remains high (20%) for the 8,000 US children each year that develop pediatric acute respiratory\ndistress syndrome (ARDS). No pharmacologic therapies have been identified that decrease the mortality risk\nfrom ARDS. This is likely due to underlying biologic heterogeneity among patients with ARDS that may result in\nsome benefiting from a therapy whereas others are harmed, limiting the ability to find effective therapies in\nclinical trials of general cohorts. Inflammatory phenotypes have been described in ARDS that may help identify\nunderlying biologic differences contributing to heterogeneity in treatment effect. However, these phenotypes\ncannot currently be identified in real-time. There is an urgent need for easily available markers to identify\nclinically relevant heterogeneity in patients with ARDS. Markers of dead space may be promising for this\npurpose. Dead space is area of the lung that receive ventilation without perfusion and reflects abnormal\npulmonary perfusion (microvascular dysfunction, low cardiac output) and alveolar overdistension. With routine\npatient monitoring data (time-based capnography, blood gases), dead space can be estimated with the end\ntidal alveolar dead space fraction (AVDSf). We have found in single-center studies that AVDSf is more strongly\nassociated with mortality risk than are markers of the severity of hypoxemia (oxygenation index [OI]) in early\npediatric ARDS. Dead space may also be an attractive marker for identifying heterogeneity of treatment effect\nfor therapies such as inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) that target pulmonary perfusion. iNO is a selective pulmonary\nvasodilator, with additional anti-inflammatory and anticoagulation effects, that is commonly used off-label for\nrefractory hypoxemia in ARDS. But almost all clinical trials of iNO therapy have failed to demonstrate a benefit\nwhen enrolling general cohorts of patients or selecting patients based on severity of hypoxemia. One small\npediatric trial found higher extracorporeal membrane oxygenation free survival suggesting the potential for\nsome subgroups to benefit from iNO therapy. Our preliminary data suggest that iNO therapy decreases the\nAVDSf associated mortality risk and that a decline in AVDSf with iNO therapy is associated with improving\nplasma markers of microvascular dysfunction. Our central hypotheses are that the routinely available AVDSf is\nmore strongly tied to mortality risk than OI and that AVDSf is an important marker of heterogeneity in the iNO\ntreatment effect in patients with ARDS. These hypotheses will be tested through the following Specific Aims:\n1) validate AVDSf for risk stratification of mortality in pediatric ARDS 2) determine if there is heterogeneity in\ntreatment effect for iNO defined by AVDSf, and 3) detect the association between AVDSf and microvascular\ndysfunction trajectory and whether iNO therapy modifies the association. Demonstrating that AVDSf\noutperforms OI for mortality risk stratification in patients with ARDS and that AVDSf may identify the patients\nmost likely to benefit from iNO therapy, has the potential to be frameshifting for future clinical trials of ARDS\ninterventions, including those of iNO therapy.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nCritical limb ischemia (CLI) affects 2 million Americans with peripheral artery disease (PAD) each year and is a\nfrequent cause of persistent ulcers and wounds, amputations, hospitalizations with frequent re-admissions, and\ndeath due to reduced blood flow to the affected limb. Untreated, CLI patients survive under 2 years. The main\ntreatment for CLI is to increase blood flow to improve limb perfusion using extremity artery bypass. When the\npatient\u2019s own vein is insufficient peripheral vascular grafts (PVG), frequently made from expanded\npolytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), are used as a synthetic graft is used for both segments. Unfortunately, PVG\nhave failure rates ranging from 20% to 50% within the first year of surgery, which increases to >60% after 5\nyears. The primary reasons for PVG failure are neointimal hyperplasia, occlusion via thrombosis, and infection.\nNo current or in-development technology successfully addresses these challenges.\nFreeFlow Medical Devices (FFMD) is aiming to optimize and commercialize tethered liquid perfluorocarbon\n(TLP) coatings on medical devices. Our TLP coating stops the adhesion of all biological components (bacteria,\nfungi, blood components) to the surface of medical devices by immobilizing a thin layer of highly inert and\nbiocompatible perfluorinated liquid. Our preliminary data demonstrate that our TLP coating effectively resists\nocclusion and pathogen colonization on vascular devices under physiological flow conditions.\nIn this Fast Track proposal, we will investigate the ability of TLP PVG to resist occlusion, thrombus formation,\nand biofilm formation, which all contribute to graft dysfunction We will also finalize the TLP additive packaging\nfor GMP manufacturing in Phase II. This will be achieved using six Aims. Phase 1 Aim 1. Perform a 90-day in\nvitro TLP PVG characterization to understand the durability and characteristics of the coating after 90 days.\nPhase 1 Aim 2. Perform a 60-day protein biofouling study to test the ability of TLP surfaces to resist protein\nadsorption since biofilm development, thrombus progression, and neointimal hyperplasia all begin with protein\nadsorption. Phase 1 Aim 3. Perform 30-day in vitro thrombogenicity testing. Phase 2 Aim 4. Obtain GMP-\nmanufactured TLP PVG. Phase 2 Aim 5. Perform an efficacy study to compare the in vivo effectiveness of TLP\nPVG with standard PVG (BD Impra\u00ae) at reducing thrombin formation, neointimal hypoplasia, and stenosis.\nPhase 2 Aim 6. Initiate the 510(k) application process to obtain FDA premarketing approval and perform a\nbiocompatibility study. These advances will allow FFMD to maximize the effectiveness of the TLP coating and\ndramatically improve PVG patient care by reducing graft failure dure to neointimal hyperplasia, infection, and\nthrombosis.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.\nGlobally, COPD prevalence is estimated to be 11.7%, and COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the\nUnited States (US). The age-adjusted prevalence of COPD is double in rural (8.2%) compared to urban areas\n(4.7%). Rurality is associated with worse COPD outcomes, such as more severe dyspnea, poorer self-\nrated health, lower health-related quality of life (HRQL), and increased risk of acute exacerbations. Significant\ngeographical disparities exist in treating and managing COPD in the United States. Less than 8% of rural\npatients have access to pulmonary rehabilitation, a critical treatment for COPD patients that improves\nall outcomes and decreases health care utilization. This project addresses an important SDOH\nproblem: access to proper care. It will provide pulmonary rehabilitation that promotes physical activity and\nexercise, as well as customized education with personalized support through health coaching for patients with\nCOPD in rural areas. Our prior NIH-funded research in the delivery of Home-based rehabilitation, in addition to\nthe current literature, supports the scientific rationale and need for a clinical trial to test the proposed\nhypothesis.\nThis application aims to test the uptake, effectiveness, and patient-caregiver-provider experience of home-\nbased pulmonary rehabilitation with health coaching for COPD patients in rural communities.\nThe proposed research that addresses access to care as the main social determinant of health will consider\npatient/community priorities, needs, and preferences through a personalized approach through health\ncoaching. The program has been tested effective in two large NIH-funded randomized studies but not\nspecifically tested in rural settings. The comprehensive qualitative assessment of the intervention will inform\nany necessary adaptation.\nThe proposed intervention will address two aspects of social injustice in COPD: inadequate COPD care and\nlack of support (factors that make living with COPD more difficult than it should be, i.e., social isolation in rural\nareas). If the project aims are achieved, an increased pulmonary rehabilitation uptake and improved physical\nand emotional quality of life will advance the scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice\nof rural patients living with COPD. Our results may inform the remote care for other chronic conditions in rural\npatients (heart failure, hypertension, obesity, diabetes).",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nTyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are specified small-molecule inhibitors of the activity of tyrosine kinases and\nhave shown therapeutic impact on treating cancers. Despite being a prevalent class of drugs in the\npharmaceutical industry, their development and clinical application are frequently hindered by a wide range of\ncardiovascular complications: QT prolongation/arrhythmia, left ventricular dysfunction, congestive heart failure,\nischemia, myocardial infarction, and hypertension. Cardiotoxicity's repercussions impede the advancement of\nnovel TKIs for cancer therapy and furthermore cause failures in preclinical drug discovery and clinical\ndevelopment. Therefore, there is an urgent need to assess cardiotoxicity induced by TKIs used in cancer\npatients' treatment. However, there is still no targeted and effective preclinical trial due to a) only focusing on\nanti-tumor effects without systematic examination of coexisting cardiovascular effects, b) limited efficiency and\naccuracy of cardiotoxicity prediction, and c) inter-species differences between animals and humans on\ncardiotoxic responses. To address this unmet need, a new in vitro human model for comprehensively assessing\nTKIs-indued cardiotoxicity is proposed here. Recently, human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived vascularized\ncardiac organoids (VCOs) developed in PI\u2019s and other labs have shown great promise in emulating the human\nheart in both cardiovascular structure and function, which makes it an ideal in vitro drug toxicity evaluation system\ntargeting cardiovascular cells by TKIs. However, three significant challenges remain in applying hPSC-derived\nVCOs to cardiotoxicity evaluation: 1) insufficient and uncoupled assessment of organoid structural and functional\nproperties; 2) continuous generation of large datasets from multifaceted characterizations that requires more\nintegrated analysis without human bias; 3) low efficiency with more individual hPSC lines. It is hypothesized that\nartificial intelligence (AI)-driven biomedical data featuring and predicting address the challenges for accurately\nassessing TKI-induced cardiotoxicity by phenotyping the cardiovascular structure and function of VCOs. The\ncentral goal is to establish an organoid-AI system to assess TKI-induced cardiotoxicity efficiently and accurately\nwith three specific aims: Aim 1. Predict TKI-induced toxicity on cardiovascular structure in VCOs by Generative\nAI algorithm; Aim 2. Phenotype TKI-induced cardiovascular dysfunction in VCOs; Aim 3. Establish a TKI-induced\ncardiotoxicity assessment system with an organoid-AI system. Upon completion of the proposed project, a\ncomprehensive human organoid-AI system for assessing TKI-induced cardiotoxicity will be established to\nincrease the efficiency and accuracy of preclinical drug safety evaluation of TKIs on human cardiotoxicity on both\ncardiovascular structure and function.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nFailure of the right ventricle (RV) is a main component of the morbidity and mortality of pulmonary hypertension\n(PH). There exists no specific treatment for RV dysfunction and failure and the only cure for many patients\n(especially in the case of pulmonary arterial hypertension) remains transplantation. This is partially due to the\ncritical lack of understanding of RV biology; therapeutic strategies that are beneficial for LV failure have worse\noutcomes when applied to those with RV failure. What has been observed in RV dysfunction in human subjects\nand animal models is exaggerated fibrosis and divergent contractile and hypertrophic responses to several drugs\nwhen compared to LV dysfunction. Thus, the RV may contain distinct pathobiology compared to the LV that has\nhigh significance for treatment of PH. Cardiac myocytes may have distinct cell signaling properties in the RV,\nthough there is a lot unknown about these differences. Previous work has shown that RV cardiac myocytes,\ncompared to those from the LV, have increased K+ current, shorter action potential duration, reduced sarcomere\nshortening, and reduced peak intracellular Ca2+ when compared to LV cardiac myocytes. These differences\ndemonstrate that RV cardiac myocytes may have molecular differences at a functional level. This diversity\nsupplement will determine how contractility, calcium handling, and size of the cardiac myocyte change during\nRV remodeling in PH, and determine and test novel drug targets that alter RV contractility. These data may\nuncover novel understanding of RV cardiac myocyte biology and lead to further therapeutic strategies for right\nheart failure. This supplement will address this concern with two Specific Aims: (1) Determine the mechanism of\ncardiac myocyte adaptation to RV pressure overload. and (2) Interrogate GPCR targets in the RV as potential\ntherapeutic targets.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nHeart failure (HF) is the leading cause of mortality, morbidity, and rehospitalizations in Appalachia. Rural areas\nhave the highest HF mortality rates. West Virginia (WV), the only state totally within the Appalachian region, has\nthe highest HF death rate in the U.S. (32.6 per 100,000; the substantial deaths in those over 65 years). HF is\ndevastating for patients and their family caregivers, especially during the HF end stages. Families are\nunprepared for this deteriorating condition, the home caregiving burdens, and the fear of a painful death. Further,\nrural Appalachians lack access to health services, end-of-life palliative care (EOLPC), and have extreme\ninequities in health.\nThe aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to test the integrated nurse-led intervention bundle of 1) HF-\nFamPALhomeCARE, 2) Visiting Neighbors supporting functional health, and 3) Appalachia Faith-based nurses\nproviding comforting palliative care. The preliminary studies verified the bundle components. This RCT is guided\nby the social support conceptual theory consistent with Appalachian culture. This intervention bundle addresses\nrural disparities in the lack of access to health care which the faith-based nurses and rural volunteers visiting\nneighbors address. The intervention components are designed to address several Appalachian social\ndeterminants of health (SDoH) disparities, such as reducing costs by nurses enabling direct access to health\nservices, clearly illustrated HF home care guides for low literacy, and inspections for safe housing for older\nadults. This mixed methods RCT will address Primary Aims (1 & 2), testing the outcomes of patients with HF\nand family caregivers (92 dyads) managing home supportive EOLPC in rural WV. Secondary Aim (3) is to\nassess the bundled intervention helpfulness, cost, and plans for maintaining the sustainability of our visiting\nneighbor volunteers, and the Faith Nurse of rural WV. Descriptive measures, group comparisons, intervention\ncosts, and focus group discussions will be reported. The qualitative results will be compared to the social support\nframework, quantitative results and to the results of the Aim 3a helpfulness ratings to identify any other facilitators\nor barriers to sustainability.\nThis R01 study supports research to improve rural health equity by providing access to health services and\naddressing SDoH disparities in underrepresented Appalachia. Designing and testing practical, sustainable\napproaches using the available rural resources to address a prevalent, devastating disease, family EOLPC\npreferences, older adults' functional health, HF home caregiving skills, and providing social support. Engaging\nrural stakeholders in recruitment, implementation, and designing sustainability plans can result in continuing\nresearch on the health, EOLPC and SDoH disparities of the 26.3 million people living across Appalachia.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nGlobal diabetes prevalence is nearing 10%, and despite advancements in treatments, compared to non-diabetic,\nindividuals with diabetes have 2-fold higher rates of heart failure, as well as increased mortality due to\ncardiovascular disease. Specifically, diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a diagnosis based on cardiac\ninsufficiency attributable only to diabetes, and characterized by the triad of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and\napoptosis. We believe these are consequences of and contributors to epigenetic changes that regulate\nexpression of genes responsible for the pathological state. Epigenetic changes are stable, yet reversible\nmodifications to chromatin and genetic material (e.g., histones, DNA). It is an established regulator of gene\nexpression associated with diabetes and heart failure\u2014with the field studying the intersection of these topics still\nrelatively young. Additionally, our prior work found that glucose can signal through a specific post-translational\nprotein modification, O-linked \uf062-N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc), and building upon current literature, our lab\nhas shown using our novel mouse model that chronically enhanced O-GlcNAc is sufficient to cause pathology\nassociated with diabetic hearts. My work focuses on identifying and studying molecular pathways regulated by\nDNA methylation changes during chronic O-GlcNAc which lead to pathology. Upon RNA-sequencing, my prior\nanalysis identified significantly increased NADPH Oxidase 4 (Nox4) with chronically increased cardiac protein\nO-GlcNAc. Similarly, methylation-sequencing of DNA from cardiac tissue of diabetic mice revealed hypo-\nmethylation (an epigenetic mark associated with increased gene expression) at the Nox4 promoter associated\nCPG island. Nox4 is a significant producer of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and its activity is governed by\nlevels of expression. The field of Nox4 in the context of chronic diabetic hearts is relatively young, and little is\nknown about its regulatory mechanisms. With these opportunities and encouraging preliminary data, I seek to\nbuild upon the rigors of past research to contribute novel knowledge and develop resources to study Nox4\u2019s\nregulation and role in chronic diabetic hearts. I hypothesize that with chronically enhanced protein O-GlcNAc (a\nkey facet of diabetic hearts), cardiac Nox4 is induced via DNA hypomethylation, and its upregulation is necessary\nto promote cardiac dysfunction and pathology. The proposal will test the following two aims: (1) Determine the\nmechanism of O-GlcNAcylation initiated DNA methylation changes leading to cardiac Nox4 upregulation. (2)\nEstablish that Nox4 depletion can prevent cardiac remodeling seen during chronically enhanced cardiac protein\nO-GlcNAc. In summary, this proposal will determine a new regulatory mechanism for Nox4 and provide\nfoundational research for the development of precision therapeutics to treat underlying pathological mechanisms\ndriving disease in diabetic hearts. This proposal will also provide the foundation for my career as a physician-\nscientist with the scientific reasoning, research, and translational skills in cardiovascular research/medicine.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe most common congenital heart disease (CHD) in children involves incomplete formation of the\ninterventricular septum (IVS), which occurs in isolation or as part of more complex CHD lesions. Myocardial fiber\norientation, lineage tracing and asymmetric gene expression together suggest distinct L-R patterning of the IVS.\nHowever, there exists a gap in the understanding of the developmental mechanisms of IVS patterning and VSD\netiologies. This hinders improvements to CHD prenatal screening, prognosis and evaluation of extra-cardiac\nanomalies, as well as efforts to engineer tissue patches for heart repair. The overall objective of this proposal\nis to delineate how L-R IVS patterning is controlled, and how perturbations lead to VSDs. We have preliminary\ndata that suggests the secreted guidance cues Ntn1 and Slit2 control boundary regulation for L-R patterning of\nthe IVS. Both genes were dysregulated in a genetic pathway dependent on the CHD-linked transcription factor,\nTbx5. We found that homozygous loss of function (LOF) of Ntn1 or Slit2 resulted in membranous or muscular\nVSDs and a trabecular-like IVS. Ntn1 LOF led to displacement of the IVS boundary toward the LV, suggesting\nthat Ntn1 may be a key regulator of boundary positioning. Conversely, Slit2 LOF disrupted boundary integrity,\nleading to mixing of RV and LV lineages, suggesting Slit2 regulation of boundary maintenance. Based on these\npreliminary data, we hypothesize that NTN1 and SLIT2 control complementary aspects of boundary regulation\nto segregate LV and RV lineages at the IVS for L-R patterning and ventricular septation. To discover how these\ndevelopmental cues direct ventricular septation, we propose the following three Specific Aims: (1) test the\nhypothesis that NTN1 from the left side of the IVS determines boundary positioning for L-R IVS patterning by\nchemorepulsion, (2) test the hypothesis that a SLIT2 signal from the RV and LV maintains boundary integrity to\npreserve cell segregation for L-R IVS patterning by chemorepulsion of IVS cells, and (3) test the hypothesis that\nboundary perturbations of L-R IVS patterning cause cell signature disturbances of misplaced cells and adjacent\ntissue microenvironments. Successful completion of this project will provide insights into the regulation of L-R\nIVS patterning and the origins of human CHDs. By expanding our comprehension of the basis of CHDs, we will\ntake an important step towards our long-term goal to improve the natural history of CHDs.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by limitation of physical activity even with current\neffect treatments. Most observational studies, clinical trials, and outpatient clinical assessments of patients with\nPAH focus on exercise capacity (the maximal effort a person can achieve under controlled circumstances),\nmeasured by cardiopulmonary exercise or six minute walk testing. However, these artificial tests do not\ncapture the intensity, frequency, duration, context, and pattern of physical activity throughout the day or week\nin the patient\u2019s life. Such an activity \u201csignature\u201d or phenotype may more accurately reflect an individual\u2019s\nfunction and perceived health-related quality of life (HRQOL) by providing insight into multisystem function,\nside effects, and treatment benefits and burdens. A physical activity intervention which is personalized for a\nPAH patient could lead to improvements in psychosocial function, symptoms, HRQOL, fitness, and even\nsurvival. Unfortunately, there have been very few published studies of physical activity in PAH patients, none of\nwhich have assessed multidimensionality in a large multicenter cohort. We have performed preliminary studies\nusing traditional accelerometry which have shown that patients with PAH cluster into low, medium, and high\nactivity phenotypes which show differences in six minute walk distance and HRQOL. Functional principal\ncomponents analysis has identified \u201csignatures\u201d of physical activity patterns throughout the day in PAH. Novel\nbiosensors which continuously capture multiple streams of data in real time (including accelerometry) would\nprovide an innovative approach to remote clinical monitoring and may increase the efficiency and pertinence of\nclinical trials in PAH.\n The Pulmonary Hypertension Association Registry (PHAR) has been prospectively collecting data from\nadult and pediatric PAH patients from centers throughout the United States since 2015. The PHAR has\nenrolled 1400 patients with 2000 patient-years of follow-up at 52 centers, representing one of the largest\nmulticenter registries of patients with PAH. We propose to measure accelerometry for one week periods\nbiannually for > 1400 patients over four years (~7000 assessments) in the PHAR with high efficiency and low\npatient burden. We aim to determine the predictors of physical activity phenotype and whether physical activity\npatterns are associated with health-related quality of life, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and\ntime to lung transplantation or death in PAH. We will estimate the \u201cminimally important difference\u201d in physical\nactivity which could be used as an end point in clinical trials in PAH. We will incorporate a novel wearable\nbiosensor which could be used to advance these models of physical activity in PAH.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Kidney transplantation is currently the optimal renal replacement therapy due to reduced morbidity and mortality,\nbetter quality of life, and decreased cost compared to dialysis. However, transplants remain severely limited by\na shortage of donor kidneys available for transplantation, with over 90,000 patients on the waiting list. This\nimbalance in supply and demand has resulted in a strong desire to use high-risk kidney grafts from older donors\nand donors after circulatory death (DCD). These high-risk kidney grafts often incur significant injury during\npreservation and transportation prior to transplantation, leading to diminished graft survival. As such, high-risk\nkidney grafts are discarded at high rates because of the inability to predict their function. To improve the\npreservation and acceptance of high-risk kidney grafts, including DCD kidneys, investigators at the Duke Ex Vivo\nOrgan Lab (DEVOL) and BioMedInnovations LLC (BMI) have developed a unique subnormothermic (22-25\u00b0C,\napproximately room temperature) oxygenated perfusion platform, consisting of a perfusion device and matched\n\u201cDEVOL solution\u201d. Pilot studies using a porcine model of DCD kidney transplantation demonstrated significant\nimprovements in post-transplant kidney graft function versus the historical standard of care, static cold storage\n(SCS).\nConsistent with the NIDDK SBIR research priority \u201cdevelopment of devices or techniques to enhance the long-\nterm success of kidney transplantation (e.g., techniques for kidney storage and preservation)\u201d, this project will\ngenerate evidence that the BMI platform provides superior performance to the current standard of care for high-\nrisk kidneys, namely hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP). Availability of this data would result in this\ntechnology rapidly moving forward to commercialization.\nThe project includes Specific Aims to 1) optimize the engineering aspects of BMI\u2019s platform (consisting of the\ndevice and perfusate); 2) determine, ex-vivo, the impact of warm ischemic injury and duration of device\npreservation on kidney graft injury for the BMI platform versus the current standard of care; and 3) compare the\nfunction of high-risk kidney grafts preserved with the BMI platform versus the current standard of care using a\nporcine kidney auto-transplant model.\nThe outcome of this project will include preclinical evidence that demonstrates that BMI\u2019s platform is likely to\nprovide a meaningful advance over the current standard of care when used in humans and advance the platform\ntowards commercialization. This will help BMI to secure further investment, successfully engage with regulators\nand ultimately, gain customer adoption that leads to improved access to kidneys for those on the transplant\nwaiting list.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Heart failure (HF) is the fastest-growing cardiovascular disorder and a leading cause of urgent healthcare\nutilization in the U.S. Effective HF physical self-care (i.e. behaviors that maintain physiologic stability (self-care\nmaintenance), monitor for changes in signs and symptoms (self-care monitoring), and respond to symptoms\nwhen they occur (self-care management)) has been linked with better patient-reported, biological and clinical\noutcomes. However relatively little is known about mental health self-care in HF. In addition, a growing body of\nresearch includes informal care partners (e.g. family members who engage in an unpaid shared partnership in\ncare) increasing the need for a critical examination of the differential impact of physical and mental health of both\ncare partners on HF management; but, this is an emerging area of science. As managing HF at home has\nincreased in intensity/complexity, the mental health impact is of growing importance. Similarly, there are well-\nknown inequities and major advocacy calls to study social determinants of health in HF (i.e. race, ethnicity,\ngender, economic resources, education, occupation and discrimination). Before we can intervene effectively,\nhowever, we need to learn more from people with HF and their care partners about what they do to manage HF,\nand how they maintain, monitor and manage their mental health. The proposed study addresses identified gaps\nin both precision (mental health) and population (social determinants) health sciences. Accordingly, the goals of\nthis prospective, dyadic- and social determinants of health theory-informed study of 100 dyads are to gain insight\ninto the role that social determinants of health play as the root causes of some of the inequities about which we\nknow, and additional inequities we are likely to discover in this study. Specifically, we will quantify the\nrelationships between both symptoms and social determinants of health and contributions to care in people with\nHF and their care partners (Aim 1), and then characterize people with HF and care partner contributions to the\nmaintenance, monitoring and management of mental health (Aim 2). Importantly, each aim is strongly rooted\nwith hypotheses of social determinants of health or preliminary data that suggest we will be successful in\nachieving these aims. The results of this study will have an important and enduring influence on future theoretical\nmodification (embedding the dyad and mental health in \u201cself\u201d-care theory), measurement (centering the dyad),\nand interventional development to promote optimal physical and mental health among HF dyads. Our long-term\ngoal is greater parity between physical and mental health in theoretical, measurement, and interventional\ndomains of HF management.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n Heart failure caused by progressive dilated cardiomyopathy is the primary cause of death in\npatients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a fatal inherited muscle wasting disorder defined by\nthe FDA as an orphan disease. Cardiomyopathy is detectable in children as young as 10 years old and is\npresent in most patients by their late teens. Most DMD patients die in their late 20s from heart failure.\n There are no approved medications for DMD cardiomyopathy. Little effort has been devoted to\ncardiomyopathy therapeutic development despite it being the main cause of DMD patient mortality. The vast\nmajority of DMD therapies in development focus on treating skeletal muscle degeneration. Current standard of\ncardiac care for DMD patients utilizes steroids and off-label anti-hypertensive and heart failure drugs to reduce\nheart inflammatory damage, workload, and tissue remodeling.\n Revidia Therapeutics, Inc. is a cardiac regenerative medicine company developing small molecules that\nreactivate endogenous cardiac repair and regenerative processes. We are advancing a novel subcutaneous\nformulation of our lead small molecule MSI-1436 into clinical trials as a treatment for DMD cardiomyopathy.\n MSI-1436 has already proven human safety. It functions by inhibiting the tyrosine phosphatase\nPTP1B via a novel allosteric mechanism. PTP1B normally inactivates endogenous tissue repair and\nregeneration processes. MSI-1436-induced inhibition of PTP1B reactivates these processes, which in turn\nreverses tissue damage. Using blinded and randomized experimental and data analysis protocols, we have\nshown that MSI-1436 stimulates heart muscle regeneration, improves heart function, and reduces infarct size\nin wild type adult mice following myocardial infarction; improves left ventricle ejection fraction in a mouse\npressure overload dilated cardiomyopathy model; slows cardiac degenerative changes in young D2.B10-\nDmdmdx/J DMD mice; and improves left ventricle ejection fraction in aged DMD animals. Doses of MSI-1436\nthat reverse cardiac injury are up to 50-times lower than the maximum well tolerated human dose.\n Revidia has completed multiple IND-enabling workstreams including 1) FDA pre-IND meetings, 2)\nefficacy testing in multiple animal models, 3) in vitro safety pharmacology, 4) ADME studies, 5) dose-range\nfinding, 6) CMC development and 7) Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) manufacturing. The final IND-enabling\nworkstream that must be completed is FDA-required GLP-compliant safety and toxicity testing of\nsubcutaneously administered MSI-1436. Proposed studies will validate subcutaneous MSI-1436 dose\nformulations and bioanalytical methods and perform repeat dose toxicology and genotoxicity testing and CNS,\nrespiratory and cardiovascular safety pharmacology testing. Completion of these studies will allow IND\napplication submission in early 2025 and initiation of clinical trials later that year. Treatment of DMD\ncardiomyopathy with MSI-1436 has significant potential to improve patient quality of life and prolong lifespan.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Nourexal\u2122: A Novel Bioenergetic Drug to Increase Donor Heart Utilization",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nIn the U.S., over 20,000 heart transplants are needed each year, but fewer than 4,000 procedures are performed\ndespite the yearly availability of more than 12,000 donors. This gap exists because 6 hearts from every 10\norgan donors are unused. The vast majority of eligible donor hearts are rejected because the transport time is\nlimited to 4 hours. To address this unmet need, Nour Heart developed and patented the bioenergetic\ncardioprotective drug, Nourexal\u2122 (Cyclocreatine Phosphate (CCrP)), which was recently granted FDA Orphan\nDrug Designation for \u201cPrevention of Ischemic Injury to Enhance Cardiac Graft Recovery and Survival in Heart\nTransplantation\u201d (DRU-2015-4951). CCrP enhances myocardial energy stores during ischemia, reduces cell\ninjury, inhibits inflammation and fibrosis, and restores normal cardiac function after extended cold storage of rat\nand dog hearts. Further, injection of CCrP (1.2 gm/kg) into rat donors, protected hearts during harvesting and\nallowed prolonged storage for 22 hours with full recovery of surgically grafted hearts for 3 days.\nIn this two-year Direct-to-Phase II SBIR project, Nour Heart, Inc. (NHI) will prepare and file an Investigational\nNew Drug (IND) for FDA approval to initiate CCrP Phase I safety trial in human healthy volunteers. Based on\nthe FDA response to NHI\u2019s Pre-IND application (PIND 125867), we will: 1) produce Good Manufacturing Practice\n(GMP) grade CCrP and determine its Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) (Aim 1); 2) conduct FDA-\nrecommended, IND-enabling CCrP preclinical safety studies in rats, dogs, and human unused cadaver donors\n(UCDs) (Aim 2) (initial rat studies indicated that CCrP is a safe drug); 3) conduct a pilot in vivo efficacy study in\npigs to confirm the ability of CCrP to safely extend cold storage time of pig hearts to 6 hours before surgically\ntransplanting the graft into recipient pigs (Aim 3). This pig study will be overseen by Dr. O.H. Frazier at the Texas\nHeart Institute to test the therapeutic benefits of our patented \u201cthree-step clinical protocol\u201d where CCrP will be\nadministered only once to heart donors and not to recipients; and 4) prepare CCrP Phase I safety protocol,\ninvestigational brochure, as well as assemble and file Nour Heart\u2019s IND application to the FDA for an indication\nfor end-stage heart failure patients scheduled for heart transplantation procedures (Aim 4). We expect CCrP to\nbe safe in rats, dogs, and human unused cadaver donors and can preserve cardiac function in the pig heart\ntransplantation model. As a novel bioenergetic cardioprotective drug, CCrP will potentially increase the time and\ndistance that the hearts can be transported, thus extending transplantation to eligible recipient candidates\nlocated outside the current 4-hour transport limit. Upon successful completion of this project, Nour Heart plans\nto commercialize CCrP by raising capital to conduct CCrP Phase I safety trial, via two venture capital groups,\nwho have indicated interest, or to partner with Rallybio pharmaceuticals. Future broader use of CCrP that can\nsafely extend transport time (>4 hours), could significantly reduce the number of unused donor hearts & expand\nsupply of useable human donor hearts, thus, potentially increase heart transplant cases by over 3,000 yearly.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "A novel long-acting conjugate of the vasodilative hormone, human brain natriuretic peptide (hBNP), to treat resistant hypertension",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "SUMMARY\n Hypertension affects one-third of US adults (68-88 million cases), contributing to >500,000 deaths per year\nand healthcare expenses of $51-131 billion annually. Despite the availability of myriad FDA-approved drugs to\nlower blood pressure, 15-20% of patients are resistant to treatment, and many more patients are unresponsive\nbecause of non-adherence to their medication schedule. With an aging population and the increasing prevalence\nof hypertension, effective treatment for hypertension is likely to become progressively more critical.\n Human brain natriuretic peptide (hBNP) potently lowers blood pressure. hBNP is produced by the heart in\nresponse to high blood pressure, leading to vasodilation, excretion of salt and water in the urine, and inhibition\nof certain enzymes that raise blood pressure. The safety and effectiveness of hBNP as a therapeutic (aka\nnesiritide, Natrecor\u00ae) were proven for short-term use, but it must be given by constant intravenous infusion or\nmultiple suboptimal daily injections, because it is rapidly removed from the blood. Sale of Natrecor\u00ae was\ndiscontinued by the manufacturer in 2018 due to decreasing sales after it was shown that a short-term infusion\nof the acute-acting endogenous peptide had no beneficial effect on reducing long-term rehospitalization or death.\nAntlia Bioscience has resolved the issue that previously impeded the long-term effectiveness of Natrecor\u00ae\n Antlia Bioscience has discovered an innovative method to extend the lifespan of hBNP in the blood, while\nkeeping its ability to lower blood pressure without increasing heart rate. Antlia has added a block of 200 units of\nthe three amino acids\u2014Proline-Alanine-Serine, PAS(200)\u2014to the hBNP peptide, creating a large molecule that\nresists degradation and elimination from the blood. Importantly, dogs treated with PAS(200)-hBNP demonstrated\nsignificant and sustained blood pressure lowering after a single injection, with minimal adverse side effects.\nSubsequently three additional hBNP compounds have been made with 400, 600, and 800 PAS units, which were\nshown to produce progressively longer and higher plasma exposure in a rat pharmacokinetic study. The\nPAS(400)-hBNP analog is anticipated to be suitable for up to 2x monthly dosing in humans, while the PAS(600)\nand PAS(800) analogs could provide once monthly or longer dosing intervals. For first proof-of-concept studies\ndesigned to establish safety and efficacy in patients, we will use the PAS(400)-hBNP product with an anticipated\n>72-hour half-life in humans. In preparation for human studies, this Direct-to-Phase-II proposal will pursue bulk\nmanufacture of clinical-grade PAS(400)-hBNP with formulation and stability studies (Aim 1). The first non-clinical\nbatch of the compound made during manufacturing process development will be used for dose-range-finding\nPK/PD studies in rats and dogs with the goal of defining the therapeutic range of doses with associated plasma\nconcentrations over time (Aim 2). From the results of Aim 2, the doses and frequency of dosing will be selected\nfor the testing of safety of the clinical grade material in rat and dog GLP-toxicity studies (Aim 3) and in a\ncardiovascular safety study in dogs (Aim 4).",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\n The overall goal of this program is the development and commercialization of a novel, safer, and more\neffective, therapy for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a progressive and generally\nfatal disease for which there is no cure. IPF has a median survival rate of 3-5 years, which is less than most\ncancers. There are approximately 100,000 people in the US with IPF with 30,000 \u2013 40,000 new cases per year.\nAs many as 40,000 Americans die each year from IPF. The two FDA approved drugs for IPF, pirfenidone and\nnintedanib, only slow disease progression, have side effects which limit their use, and do not improve mortality.\nClearly, there is a significant need for therapies to treat this devastating disease. Additionally, there are several\nother causes of progressive pulmonary fibrosis including connective tissue-associated interstitial lung disease\n(ILD), fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis and sarcoidosis for which new antifibrotics are required.\n IPF is characterized by excessive collagen deposition by activated myofibroblasts in the lung. NovoMedix\nhas developed a novel series of small molecules that inhibit myofibroblast activation and differentiation and can\nalso convert activated fibroblasts back to their quiescent state, potentially reversing fibrotic damage. NM novel\ncompounds inhibit IL-11 secretion by activated fibroblasts and epithelial cells and act as allosteric AMP Kinase\n(AMPK) agonists. NovoMedix drug candidates decrease fibrosis and inflammation in two different bleomycin\nmodels of pulmonary fibrosis. They also decrease fibrosis and inflammation in a liver fibrosis model; prevent\nheart failure in mouse transverse aortic constriction (TAC) models; and prevent doxorubicin-induced\ncardiomyopathy in mouse cancer models. IL-11 and AMPK play key roles in fibrosis and inflammation, and\nactivation of AMPK has been shown to be cardioprotective. However, the role of inflammation in IPF is unclear,\nand there is widespread agreement that the bleomycin mode of lung fibrosis in mice has limitations as a\ntranslational model.\n We have also identified new NM compounds that lower IC50s and better oral availability, which we believe\nwill be superior drug development candidates. Our hypothesis is that one or more of these compounds will\nreduce lung fibrosis and block pro-fibrotic feedforward loops, reducing disease progression and improving\noutcomes. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Confirm efficacy in novel cell assays including\nphysiologically relevant stretch and 3D models, and select lead candidates, 2) Scale-up production of lead\ncandidates for animal studies, and 3) Demonstrate efficacy in the TGF-\uf062 model of progressive pulmonary fibrosis,\nwhich has some key advantages over the bleomycin model. These studies will pave the way for trials in lung\nfibrosis patients.",

The underlying mechanisms of loss of capillary endothelial cells (ECs) and\nobliterative vascular lesion formation remain unclear. Our preliminary data showed that arterial\nprograming was evident in human PAH patients and rodents.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nThe goal of this STTR proposal submission is to develop a new extracorporeal membrane oxygenation\n(ECMO) pump designed to efficiently accommodate the low flow rates needed for pediatric and neonatal\npatients. In smaller pediatric patients including toddlers and neonates we need ECMO pumps that can operate\nat lower blood flow rates to avoid the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis), shear stress, and platelet\nactivation. For this project, based on the needs of our neonatal intensive care unit and carbon dioxide removal,\nwe propose to design, develop, and test a low-flow pump that can operate from 0.05 to 0.5 L/min (equivalent to\n50 to 500 cc/min) for use in our neonatal patients and patients who require carbon dioxide removal. This flow\nrate is an order of magnitude less than current pump designs and should significantly reduce hemolysis and\nother centrifugal pump effects.\n Aim 1 \u2013 Pump Modelling, Design, and Construction: the pump design will be created to meet the flow rate\nspecifications of 0.05 to 0.5 L/min. Dr. Wu and his team at the University of Maryland will utilize computational\nfluid modeling (CFD) to develop the pump with the optimal geometry parameters, such as impeller size and\nvolute diameter to provide high efficiency and good biocompatibility (low hemolysis and thrombosis potential).\nMilestone: system bench tested for proper operation at low flow rates using distilled water.\n Aim 2 \u2013 Evaluate the Device through Comparative Blood Flow Testing: tests will be conducted within the\nresearch laboratories at Children\u2019s National to compare the performance of the new device to the current\nstandard-of-care pump models. These tests will examine the flow of blood through each pump at different\ndesignated rates and measure the index of hemolysis based on plasma free hemoglobin (PFH) levels.\nMilestone: hemolysis reduced by 20% at low flow rates compared to current models.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). A key cardiovascular\noutcome is left ventricular remodeling in the form of concentric hypertrophy, fibrosis, and vascular remodeling.\nThis results in diastolic dysfunction and eventual heart failure. There are no specific therapies for this adverse\nremodeling in T1D, therefore, progress in the prevention or regression of this condition requires identification of\nnew treatment approaches. In T1D and T2D there is a loss of the 11 amino acid sensory nerve neuropeptide\nsubstance P (SP). Using an animal model of T2D, we identified that replacement of lost SP provides protection\nagainst cardiac fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction via activation of the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK-1R). We have\nsubsequently determined that many C-terminal metabolites of SP retain biological activity at the NK-1R, and\nfurther determined that a mimetic of the SP metabolite SP7-11, which activates the NK-1R, prevents cardiac\nfibrosis and restores normal cardiac function in T2D mice. Thus, SP and SP metabolites that activate the NK-1R\nare cardioprotective in diabetes. Further, we have identified that the N-terminal SP metabolite SP1-9, does not\nactivate the NK-1R but instead is active at the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 (MrgprX2). This is\nsignificant because MrgprX2 is found almost exclusively on mast cells and mast cells contribute to adverse\ncardiac remodeling, particularly fibrosis. Thus, SP1-9 and MrgprX2 would be predicted to promote adverse\ncardiac remodeling. Therefore, the current project will utilize fixed and frozen cardiac tissue, plasma, and fixed\nand frozen coronary vessel tissue to assess SP metabolites, SP receptors, SP metabolizing enzymes, mast\ncells, fibrosis, as well as available clinical parameters to determine the extent to which cardioprotective and\nadverse cardiac remodeling-promoting molecules and cells are present in the T1D heart. These parameters will\nbe compared with T2D and non-diabetic hearts. We will also correlate: 1) the assessed parameters with\nfibrosis/vascular remodeling as primary outcomes; 2) the assessed parameters with each other as secondary\noutcomes; and 3) the assessed parameters with available clinical data as tertiary outcomes. Emphasis will be\nplaced on the association between SP and SP metabolites with the aforementioned outcomes. Our overall\nhypothesis is that T1D results in low SP levels, cardiac and coronary vascular remodeling and reduced cardiac\nfunction from either decreased neuronal SP production and less NK-1R activation or SP metabolism giving high\nSP1-9 levels and activation of MrgprX2. We will test our hypothesis using three specific aims: 1) Determine SP,\nSP metabolites and neuronal SP content in the T1D heart and plasma; 2) Determine SP metabolizing peptidases,\nNK-1R, MrgprX2, MCs, fibrosis and vascular remodeling in the T1D heart; and 3) Determine the relationship\nbetween SP metabolizing peptidases, NK-1R, MrgprX2 and MCs to fibrosis and vascular remodeling in the T1D\nheart. These studies will provide new insights into the role of SP and SP metabolites in the human heart in T1D\nand may indicate a new therapeutic approach for cardiac remodeling in T1D patients.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nDysregulated sleep and circadian disruption are common among adults in the United States. An estimated 30-50% of\nadults endorse some form of sleep-related problem, such as short sleep duration (<6 hours/night), poor sleep quality,\npresence of insomnia symptoms, or an early or late chronotype (i.e., preference for certain sleep and wake time) that is\nat odds with the dominant societal social clock. These sleep problems are being increasingly implicated as significant\ncontributors to lower cardiovascular health (CVH) and thus subsequently higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity\nand mortality. For example, short sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and evening chronotype are associated with a\nnumber of components to CVH, including obesity, diabetes, and lower diet quality. Consequently, these same sleep-\nrelated factors are associated with a higher risk for new-onset CVD, including coronary heart disease and heart failure.\nThere are significant health disparities for sleep health, CVH, and CVD. Dysregulated sleep, poorer CVH, and higher CVD\nmorbidity and mortality are disproportionately distributed across populations, with individuals of non-white\nracial/ethnic groups and those overly burdened by socio-, economic-, and environmental disadvantage faring the worst.\nDespite these parallel problems among the same populations and the significant extant literature on the sleep-CVD\nassociation, there is a dearth of research on potential ways in which sleep disparities contribute to CVH and CVD\ndisparities and how to simultaneously address both of these connected problems.\nTherefore, the overall research-related goal of this two-year Diversity Supplement proposal is to address the current\nneed for research on the intersection of sleep and CVD disparities in diverse populations through the following aims: 1)\ndetermine associations of sleep factors, chronotype, and chronotype-sleep timing alignment with left ventricular mass\nindex, 2) determine associations of sleep factors, chronotype, and chronotype-sleep timing alignment with potential\nbehavioral (physical activity, diet quality, alcohol use, smoking) and biological (cortisol) mechanisms, and 3) determine\nwhether these associations differ by individual- and geocoded, community-level social determinants of health. In parallel\nto this research, the overall training-related goal of this Supplement is to support Dr. Brittanny Polanka, PhD in receiving\nnecessary mentorship and career development guidance to become an independent, extramurally-funded principal\ninvestigator in the field of cardiovascular behavioral medicine. In collaboration with a mentorship team including the\nexpertise of Drs. S. Justin Thomas, Marwah Abdalla, and Mercedes Carnethon, an individualized career development\nplan has been created to address mentee training gaps in measurement and processing of objective sleep and circadian\ndata, use of subclinical assessment markers derived from echocardiography, and methodological and statistical\napproaches in sleep and CVD disparities research. Completion of the proposed research aims and training objectives will\nserve as the foundation upon which Dr. Polanka will prepare a K career development application to further her career\ntrajectory towards independence.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nSelf-renewing cell populations accumulate somatic mutations with aging and/or in response to environmental\ninsult and chronic inflammation. Most of these mutations in normal tissues have no functional consequence. In\nrare cases, these somatic mutations can confer a selective advantage leading to clonal expansion in\nhematopoietic stem cells, a phenomenon termed 'Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential' (CHIP).\nCHIP has been associated with a selective range of non-hematopoietic conditions, including coronary artery\ndisease, stroke, heart failure, venous thromboembolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic liver\ndiseases, and osteoporosis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which CHIP specifically promotes these\ndiseases remain largely unknown. The overarching goal of this proposal is to molecularly connect CHIP with\nthe development of associated diseases through developing and applying statistical and machine learning\nmethods to multi-omics data in the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed), UK Biobank, and\nMass General Brigham Biobank (MGBB). Specifically, I propose the following aims. In Aim 1, I will develop a\nstatistical method that combines multiple proteins implicated in the same pathway to improve discovery and\nfacilitate translational insights for proteomics-based association analyses. The combined protein quantitative\ntraits generated by this method will be used in the following aims. In Aim 2, I will examine how the presence of\nCHIP and each CHIP driver gene specifically promote certain diseases through (1) identifying the proteomic\nsignatures of CHIP and quantifying the mediation effects to associated diseases and (2) evaluating the\npotential modifications of CHIP-associated diseases by the expression levels of genes implicated in diverse\nmolecular factors. In Aim 3, I will evaluate how the progression of CHIP promotes associated diseases.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nThe diagnosis and follow-up of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) continues to be challenging,\nwith a lack of unambiguous biomarkers that reflect the course of the disease. PAH is characterized by pulmonary\nvascular remodeling with abnormal cellular proliferation and fibrosis. This leads to an obstructive vasculopathy\nof the pulmonary arterioles, resulting in pulmonary hypertension (PH) and progressive right heart failure that lead\nto morbidity and mortality. Hemodynamics and right heart function are commonly used to diagnose disease and\nmonitor progression and response to therapy. However, these readouts are altered in other common heart and\nlung diseases and their changes are not specific to pulmonary vascular remodeling. This lack of specificity has\nresulted in critical unmet need for noninvasive approaches for directly monitoring pulmonary vascular remodeling\nin PAH that could be used to guide treatment in patients, thereby improving their health outcomes. To address\nthis need, we have developed 129Xe magnetic resonance imaging (129Xe MRI) as a method to produce\nquantitative 3D maps of gas transfer across the pulmonary blood-gas barrier. 129Xe MRI has a distinct PAH\nsignature and can simultaneously measure capillary blood volume and hemodynamic changes associated with\npulmonary vascular remodeling. The objective of this project is to associate pathologic pulmonary vascular\nremodeling in PAH at a cellular and pathological level with specific changes in gas exchange physiology and\nhemodynamics. We hypothesize that different types of remodeling, such as inflammation, fibrosis and\nproliferation, result in unique changes in gas exchange physiology and hemodynamics that can be monitored\nwith 129Xe MRI. Our preliminary studies have identified a 129Xe MRI signatures that differentiates PAH from other\ncommon heart and lung diseases. This technology is also sensitive to early pulmonary vascular remodeling 1-2\nweeks after exposure to monocrotaline (MCT) in a preclinical rat PH model. We will extend these studies and\ndetermine our objective via the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the relationship between\npulmonary vascular remodeling and both gas exchange and hemodynamic abnormalities in PAH patients\nundergoing lung transplant, to correlate lung pathology and cellular identity with defects in 129Xe MRI gas\nexchange and spectroscopy. In Aim 2, we will determine the sensitivity of different monitoring approaches to\nearly remodeling and response to therapy in the MCT and Sugen-hypoxia preclinical models of PH. In Aim 3, we\nwill determine the ability of 129Xe MRI to longitudinally monitor disease progression in patients. The expected\noutcomes of this project will be a direct link between pulmonary vascular remodeling and changes in lung\nphysiology, along with a novel, noninvasive biomarker for its monitoring. This proposed research is significant\nbecause it will define the mechanistic links between pulmonary vascular remodeling and changes in gas\nexchange physiology and hemodynamics in PAH. These studies will have an important positive impact because\nthey lay the foundation for a strategy of noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of PAH activity in the clinic.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract. The goal of this R61/R33 proposal is to carry out a phase IA/IB clinical study of\nAAVrh.10hFXN (a serotype rh.10 adeno-associated virus coding for human frataxin) to treat\ncardiac manifestations of Friedreich\u2019s ataxia (FA), the most common inherited ataxia. FA is a fatal,\npresently, untreatable disorder. Most cases result from intron variants in the frataxin (FXN) gene; when\ninherited from both parents, there is resulting haploinsufficiency of FXN gene expression. While\nprogressive neurologic disease limits mobility, cardiomyopathy is responsible for substantial morbidity and\n60% of deaths secondary to progressive heart failure and arrhythmias. Cardiac MRI (CMR) data from our\ngroup and others demonstrate that FA-associated cardiomyopathy initially manifests with increased left\nventricular (LV) myocardial mass (a potentially reversible phenotype) prior to development of myocardial\nfibrosis (irreversible damage). AAVrh.10hFXN, the therapeutic gene transfer vector to be used in the\nproposed human study, is a nonhuman primate-derived serotype rh.10 capsid with a constitutive promoter\ndriving the normal human frataxin cDNA. AAVrh.10hFXN will be administered intravenously, a vector and\nroute which in experimental animal models effectively delivers genes to the heart. Based on our preclinical\nefficacy data in two murine models in which intravenous AAVrh.10hFXN reverses the consequences of FA\ncardiomyopathy, together with extensive safety data, we are ready to initiate a phase IA/IB clinical trial\nwith the following aims. R61 aim 1. Prepare and submit an Investigational New Drug package and gain\napproval from the FDA and other regulatory groups (Institutional Review Board, Biosafety) to initiate a\nphase IA/IB clinical trial. Milestone. Full regulatory approval to initiate parts A and B of the clinical trial,\nenroll the 1st subject in part A. R61 aim 2 and milestone. Manufacture clinical grade AAVrh.10hFXN for\nthe part A (safety/dose-ranging) clinical trial. R33 aim 3. Carry out the part A (safety/dose-ranging) trial to\ndetermine the maximum tolerable dose of AAVrh.10hFXN therapy for the cardiac manifestations of FA.\nMilestone. Initiate and complete assessment of n=9 individuals (3 doses, 3 each), with an audited final\nreport. R33 aim 4 and milestone. Manufacture clinical grade AAVrh.10hFXN for part B (safety/preliminary\nefficacy) clinical trial. R33 aim 5. Carry out the part B safety/preliminary efficacy study at the highest\ntolerable dose from part A. Milestone. Complete assessment of n=15 individuals, with an audited final\nreport. Given that genetic variance is responsible for many forms of cardiomyopathy and that existing\ntreatments are limited, this study offers a potential therapeutic paradigm shift to reverse cardiac phenotype\nand thus improve clinical outcomes for a broad range of patients with genetically mediated\ncardiomyopathies at risk adverse LV remodeling and its devastating clinical consequences.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nPulmonary arterial hypertension continues to be a devastating chronic disease. Despite a variety of new\ntherapies, this disease process remains highly morbid and fatal. Most therapies are only temporizing and are\nminimally effective because of the insidious onset and late recognition of this disease process. Double lung\ntransplantation is the only effective treatment; however, because of scarcity of organs and listing inequities, most\npatients are unlikely to receive a transplant while on the waiting list. Developing an effective long-term support\nsystem that can offload the right ventricle and protect the pulmonary vasculature would provide a bridge of\nsupport and potential for recovery or management on pharmacological support. The objective and long-term\ngoal of this project is to design a catheter that will eventually be coupled with a pulmonary support system that\ncan prolong the survival and enhance the ability to medically treat patients with pulmonary artery hypertension,\nas well as provide a chance for those on the lung transplant waiting list to receive an organ. We intend to\naccomplish this by developing an innovative dual lumen catheter that can be positioned and fixed for a prolonged\nperiod of time using a novel engineering mechanism and will properly unload the right ventricle and pulmonary\nvasculature via an inter-atrial configuration. This will further include an innovative monitoring system to monitor\nand control flows and protect a deconditioned left ventricle, preventing left sided heart failure.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project summary / abstract\nCongenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a complex congenital anomaly where an early embryologic insult\ndisrupts diaphragmatic and pulmonary development, often resulting in severe, acute cardiopulmonary\ndysfunction post-natally and affects 2-4 per 10,000 births in the US, amounting to approximately 1500 children\nevery year with an annual societal cost approaching $400 million. The CDH Study Group (CDHSG), established\nin 1995, is a consortium of institutions dedicated to improving the lives of families/patients affected by CDH\nthrough collaboration, data collation, investigation, and dissemination. Previous trials in CDH suffered limitations\ncommon to many uncommon disease investigative efforts including limited enrollment, prolonged trial conduct,\ninflated resource utilization, and suboptimal power, all for unconvincing evidence. The overarching goal of this\nmulti-institutional initiative is to leverage the strength of collaboration, experienced clinical investigator\nleadership, and innovative trial design/analysis to address clinical questions in CDH. An important example is\nthe use of inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) in the postnatal stabilization phase of clinical care in CDH. Despite mounting\nevidence concluding that, among patients with CDH, iNO is ineffective (and potentially harmful) and costly, most\nclinicians maintain equipoise over its effectiveness, and use remains near universal. Our investigative approach,\na pragmatic, multi-center, de-implementation trial, with a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized design, within the\nconstruct of an established registry, will address the clinical and cost-effectiveness of iNO in CDH. Nineteen\nparticipating centers will de-implement iNO - randomized at the center level. We will include 900 total neonates\nwith CDH. Our first specific aim is to determine if de-implementation of iNO in the post-natal resuscitation /\nstabilization phase affects the composite outcome of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) use and/or mortality\n(composite primary outcome), as well as ECLS use, mortality, and/or oxygenation in CDH (secondary outcomes).\nOur second specific aim is to establish the cost-effectiveness of de-implementing iNO as a therapy in the post-\nnatal resuscitation / stabilization phase of CDH management, which will be assessed as the incremental health\nsystem costs (savings) per prevented ECLS use and/or death. Our third specific aim is to evaluate factors that\ninfluence iNO de-implementation at the individual physician and site level to inform strategies to improve de-\nimplementation throughout the trial. We believe this initiative, including an innovative design and collaborative\napproach, will serve as a foundation for ongoing trials in CDH and will serve as pivotal example for advancing\nthe adoption of cost-effective, evidence-based strategies in neonatal and pediatric care.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nIn-hospital mortality rates for acute respiratory failure (ARF) have improved, resulting in increasing numbers of\nARF survivors. While their survival is indicative of major clinical advances in care, many of these individuals are\nleft with long-term physical, cognitive, and psychological sequelae of their critical illness, leading to reduced\nquality of life (QoL). Interventions in the post-intensive care unit (ICU) setting have struggled to make headway\non improving QoL and there is an urgent need to understand relevant modifiable factors. Evidence suggests that\nhealth expectations and bothersome levels of uncertainty about future health are two such factors. The unifying\ngoal of this proposal is to understand key factors associated with bothersome uncertainty and expectation\nformation in ARF survivors at hospital discharge, as these factors are potential targets for intervention.\nWe will study a cohort of 65 ARF survivors to characterize the prevalence of bothersome uncertainty and test\nthe hypothesis that it is associated with perceived quality of healthcare provider communication (Aim 1). We will\nalso perform at least 25 semi-structured interviews with a purposively selected cohort to further elucidate the\nexperiences which shaped ARF survivors\u2019 level of uncertainty and identify the sources of information that most\ninfluenced their expectations (Aim 2). This work will be performed leveraging resources allocated to an existing\nparent study (1R01HL163660), to ensure feasibility and success within the time period described in this proposal.\nThis work will fill a gap in knowledge about how bothersome uncertainty and health expectations develop at the\ntime of hospital discharge after ARF. The results will be applicable to the development of post-ICU interventions\naddressing expectations and uncertainty.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nHeart failure (HF) is a nationwide epidemic with over 6 million afflicted patients and 600,000 new patients\ndiagnosed each year. Many HF patients present with left bundle branch (LBB) block morphology and mechanical\ndyssynchrony which are strong predictors of cardiovascular mortality. Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)\nhas emerged as a powerful treatment for HF. Approximately 30% of patients still do not improve after therapy,\nhowever, and improvement of the responder rate to pacing therefore remains a crucial clinical challenge. His\nand Left Bundle Branch (LBB) pacing have therefore recently emerged as alternatives CRT. Left bundle pacing\nand LBB pacing arguably produce a physiologically normal ventricular activation pattern, by utilizing the native\nHis-Purkinje system. Despite the creation of specialized pacing electrodes and sheaths, successful placement\nof the His lead is achieved in ~80% of cases. Initially, time consuming mapping (and significant fluoroscopic\nimaging and related radiation) must be performed to accomplish the following: 1) Locate the His signal, 2) Deliver\nthe lead perpendicular to the myocardial tissue to reach the His, and 3) Pace to demonstrate selective His\ncapture with acceptable pacing capture thresholds. Hence, the overall goal of this Phase I proposal is to use a\ndeployable suction flute-tipped lead placement sheath to both improve mapping the His location of the heart,\nand to place the lead into the His with the lead\u2019s orthogonal orientation. Recently, we have developed a sheath\nwhich can deploy a suction flute within the heart. We intend to refine our design and optimize it for His targeting\nand stabilization. Suction will also serve as an indicator that our flute is oriented orthogonally to the endocardium.\nTo build on the previous successes, this work will be accomplished by the following Specific Aims: 1) Refine\nflute design to incorporate electrodes, arrayed in the rim of the flute and 2) Validate the safety and\nefficacy of the His lead stabilization technology in a cohort of swine (n=6) in a chronic 4-week study. The\nvalidated novel sheath configuration will align our deployable suction flute with a high degree of freedom for\nadjustment. The successful completion of this Phase I proposal will systematically address the current\nchallenges of His lead placement, reducing the complexity of lead placement, while also improving placement\naccuracy and long-term outcomes. A subsequent Phase II SBIR will translate this technology to the clinic for\noptimization of His pacing, and a reduction in non-responder rates. This technology addresses some of the\nshortcomings of CRT that requires three lead placements including one in the coronary sinus which is often\ndifficult and may require substantial fluoroscopy time. In addition to improved outcome, there is an opportunity\nto reduce the healthcare cost of the treatment of HF epidemic.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nIn Uganda, heart failure presents significant challenges due to limited resources and high prevalence. This\ndiversity supplement proposes an implementation adaptation study that aims to enhance HF diagnosis and\ntreatment through two main strategies. First, leveraging the parent R01's Community of Practice at each site,\ninvestigators will co-design and evaluate an Echocardiography Training Intervention Package for non-\nspecialists across six Regional Referral Hospitals (Aim 1). This initiative builds upon existing local echo training\nmodels and integrates advanced AI to improve early identification and management of heart failure, especially\nheart failure with reduced ejection fraction, for which timely initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy\n(GDMT) can significantly improve outcomes. Second, the project will analyze trends in GDMT prescribing\nwithin a longitudinal cohort of symptomatic heart failure patients, using mixed effects logistic regression to\nunderstand prescribing practices at the RRHs (Aim 2). By integrating advanced echocardiography training with\ncomprehensive analysis of GDMT prescribing, the project aims to improve clinical outcomes and establish\nsustainable healthcare practices that address broad sociodemographic disparities in HF care across Uganda,\naligning with National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute priorities and enhancing cardiovascular management in\na setting with profound healthcare delivery challenges. In this diversity supplement, the candidate, an assistant\nprofessor medicine in the division of cardiovascular medicine, will apply her expertise in echocardiography and\nglobal health. She will utilize her experience in echocardiography training of non-specialists, gained through\nprevious work in Haiti, to lead this implementation adaptation study aimed at enhancing heart failure diagnosis\nand management. The supplement will provide the funding needed to support the candidate, giving her\nmentorship and training in implementation science, while advancing the goals of the parent grant.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nEndocrinopathies, sleep disorders, cognitive issues, cardiovascular conditions, sensory impairments, and ability\ndifferences not only impact the quality of life of individuals with Down syndrome (DS) and their caregivers but\ncan intersect to magnify the threats of these co-occurring conditions. Moreover, individuals with intellectual\ndisabilities face additional barriers surrounding healthcare access and their decision-making involvement that\ncan jeopardize their health. The dearth of observational studies that richly detail co-occurring conditions, social\ndeterminants of health (SDoH), and the ableism individuals with DS experience represents a major challenge to\nproviding clinical care to individuals with DS. Our long-term objective is to partner with clinicians, researchers,\nindividuals with DS, and caregivers across the country to establish a diverse cohort of individuals with DS for\ncomprehensive longitudinal phenotyping including multi-omics and to develop an infrastructure for intervention\nstudies. This multi-center, multi-disciplinary collaborative team will engage individuals from infancy through\nyoung adulthood to undergo blood sample collection, imaging studies, qualitative interviews, questionnaire\ncompletion, sleep assessments, and remote physiologic monitoring while subsets will undergo additional specific\nprocedures with the goal of rich longitudinal phenotyping across multiple systems:\n Endocrine: thyroid and gonadal function\n Cardiometabolic: lipids, inflammation, meal-related glucose excursion, insulin secretion & sensitivity\n Cardiovascular: blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and left ventricular mass and function\n Nutrition: anthropometrics, body composition, bone density, nutritional intake, and appetite/satiety\n Sleep: obstructive and central sleep apnea, hypoventilation, participant and caregiver sleep quantity and quality\n Physical Activity: sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous activity\n Neurocognitive: caregiver reported and objectively assessed measures, peripheral blood Alzheimer disease\n markers, audiology, brain MRI, secondary analyses of sleep study EEG\n SDoH: family education, income, English proficiency, medical literacy, neighborhood characteristics\n Ethical Issues: decision-making involvement, experiences with ableism, and healthcare access\n Electronic Health Information: diagnoses, medications, procedures, labs, and imaging\n Multi-omics: genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome\nProcedures will be repeated at a cadence that depends upon baseline age (<15y, every 12-18 mo) or (>15-30y,\nevery 24-30 mo), baseline results, pre-existing co-morbidities, and subsequent interventions. Community\nmembers will help inform study design and the specific procedures to be undertaken will be tailored to the abilities\nof individuals with DS and to minimize participant and caregiver burden.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT: HEART AND LUNG OUTCOMES POST-TUBERCULOSIS (HALO Post-TB)\nThe global prevalence of post-tuberculosis lung disease (PTLD) is estimated to be ~50%, but our understanding\nof PTLD is incomplete as studies have not performed full pulmonary function testing (PFTs). Furthermore, the\nprevalence of cardiovascular sequelae of TB is largely unknown as few post-TB studies have included\nassessments of cardiac structure and function. HIV is a risk factor for TB. We and others have shown that HIV\nis associated with cardiopulmonary markers associated with worse mortality including decreased diffusion\ncapacity for carbon monoxide (DLco) on PFTs, elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) on\nechocardiography, and reduced cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) on cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).\nThese US-based studies have included few, if any, individuals with prior TB. To our knowledge, no prior study\nhas examined pulmonary and cardiac outcomes after TB and the role of HIV as an effect modifier for the\ncardiopulmonary phenotypes seen. This Heart and Lung Outcomes Post-TB (HALO Post-TB) study will fill these\ngaps. Our central hypothesis is that TB is associated with a higher prevalence of cardiopulmonary disease and\nthat HIV coinfection modifies cardiopulmonary phenotypes post TB. The overall objectives of this proposal are\nto elucidate prevalence, trajectory, and mechanisms of cardiopulmonary abnormalities post-TB in a high TB and\nHIV burden country. HALO Post-TB will be a longitudinal cohort study that will enroll people with and without HIV\nin Kampala, Uganda including 480 individuals at completion of treatment for pulmonary TB and 120 healthy\ncomparators who have never had pulmonary TB disease. Specific Aim 1 will perform full PFTs (spirometry, DLco,\nand lung volumes), echocardiography, 6-minute walk test, and validated questionnaires to determine the impact\nof HIV coinfection on cardiopulmonary function at baseline (completion of TB treatment) and the persistence of\nthese findings at 2 years. Aim 2 will perform CPET at baseline (completion of TB treatment) in a random subset\nof 50% of participants to determine the impact of HIV coinfection on mechanisms underlying cardiorespiratory\nfitness. Finally, Aim 3 will examine a panel of 11 plasma biomarkers and use an unbiased machine learning\napproach to identify phenotypic clusters and determine whether there are differences in biomarkers that may\nidentify mechanistic pathways that explain the different phenotypes. The proposed research will include\nspecimen banking and will serve as the foundational study of the effect of HIV on cardiopulmonary involvement\nin post-TB disease, a necessary precursor to identifying mechanisms and potential treatment. The expected\noutcome to develop a well-characterized post-TB cohort that includes comprehensive cardiopulmonary\nmeasures to identify distinct cardiopulmonary phenotypes and whether HIV is an effect-modifier on these\nphenotypes to enable future mechanistic studies, targeted interventions, and improvements in clinical care.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Advancing Commercial Readiness of a No-implant Interatrial Shunt Therapy to Treat Heart Failure",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nCongestive heart failure (CHF) is a progressive condition that currently affects over 6 million patients in the US.\nIt accounts for over $35B in annual healthcare expenditure and is responsible for over one million hospitalizations\neach year. Approximately half of all patients with CHF have a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) greater than\n40% and are categorized as having heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, EF \u2265 50%) or mid-\nrange ejection fraction (HFmrEF, 40% \u2264 EF < 50%). The prognosis for these patients is poor: due to a paucity\nof treatment options, patients have 5-year and 10-year mortality rates of 50% and 90%, respectively. Although\nexisting pharmacological therapies have demonstrated symptomatic improvement and mortality benefit in\npatients with reduced ejection fraction heart failure, there are currently limited FDA-approved treatment options\n(pharmacological or device-based) for the HFpEF/HFmrEF patient population. The concept of interatrial shunting\nhas gained attention as a potential therapeutic option for patients with CHF. By creating a connection between\nthe high-pressure left atrium to the low-pressure right atrium elevated left atrial pressure (LAP) may be effectively\nlowered thereby relieving CHF symptoms. Thus far, interatrial shunt implants have demonstrated positive safety\nsignals and positive reported outcomes, including significant reduction in left atrial filling pressure, improvements\nin 6-minute walk test, quality of life, and New York Heart Association classification and most importantly, heart\nfailure events. Nonetheless intracardiac implants carry proven clinical risks including clot formation, device\nfracture and migration, implantation failure, and interference with future cardiac interventional therapies. There\nis currently no device available that can provide therapeutic left atrial decompression without the long-term\nclinical risks and concerns of leaving behind a foreign body in the heart. Alleviant Medical has developed a novel\ntranscatheter approach to relieve left atrial pressure by creating an interatrial shunt without the need for a cardiac\nimplant. Following the success of design verification testing and positive results from a 38-patient first-in-human\nclinical study, Alleviant received FDA IDE approval to investigate the safety and efficacy of a no-implant interatrial\nshunt for patients with heart failure in a pivotal randomized controlled trial which is currently underway. The goal\nof this Commercial Readiness Pilot proposal has two aims: (1) implement high-volume manufacturing capabilities\nand establish production readiness of the ALV1 System, and (2) execute reimbursement and marketing initiatives\nto establish value to payers and promote disease and therapy awareness. To achieve this goal, Alleviant will\nprocure and complete injection mold qualifications for scaled production of critical components, implement\ndesign for manufacturing process modifications, de-risk single source supply chain elements, and increase the\nsterilization throughput capacity.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nHeart failure (HF) is a nationwide epidemic. Many HF patients are presented with left bundle branch block\n(LBBB) morphology and mechanical dyssynchrony, which are strong predictors of cardiovascular mortality. For\npatients with prolonged QRS duration >150 ms, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is recommended to\nrestore normal activation patterns in the heart. About 30% of patients, however, still do not improve after CRT\n(non-responders), and the percentage of CRT non-responders has remained relatively constant. To address\nthe issue of CRT non-responders and improve the treatment of conduction disorders, there are new exciting\ndevelopments in pacing therapy (e.g., HIS bundle pacing, left branch bundle (LBB) pacing, LV endocardial\npacing). When ischemia and/or a scar are present, experiments have shown that lead positioning and timing of the\nLV stimulation are critical parameters that require precise optimization to achieve positive CRT responses. This is\nespecially relevant when a large number of CRT recipients (\u226550%) in North America and Europe have ischemic\ncardiomyopathy (ICM), and the percentage of CRT non-responders is higher in ICM patients than in non-ICM\npatients. As such, computational models are powerful tools that can be exploited to optimize CRT response on a\npatient-specific basis. In this Phase I grant, we will develop a software tool for the optimization of therapies to\nreduce non-responder rates and patient identification for CRT, conduction system pacing (CSP), and LV\nendocardial pacing (LVEP) therapies using physics-based modeling, artificial intelligence, and machine\nlearning (ML). Coronary flow and electromechanics models will be coupled bi-directionally. We pioneered\nmodeling of this coupling that includes coronary flow regulation mechanisms. These studies suggest a\nthreshold in coronary perfusion, depending on the ischemia location and size, where CRT is ineffective (i.e.,\n\u201cpoint of no return\u201d). With patient-specific data, we can translate our swine-specific models to the clinic, as we\ndid for our study on the effects of an LV assist device on a failing human biventricular unit. This work will be\naccomplished by the following two Specific Aims: (1) Modify an existing experimentally-validated cardiac\nelectro-mechanics-perfusion computational framework to simulate the acute effects of CRT, CSP, and\nLVEP in treating mechanical dyssynchrony in LBBB + ischemia; and (2) Integrate the computational\nmodeling framework with ML and optimization algorithms to optimize CRT, CSP, and LVEP in patients\nwith ischemia. This proposal will provide a software tool for optimizing therapies to reduce non-responder\nrates and patient identification for CRT, CSP, and LVEP therapies. This would have a substantial impact on\nimproving treatment and reducing the healthcare cost of the HF epidemic. A successful Phase I will pave the\nway to Phase II to advance this technology through regulatory approval of software as a medical device to\nimprove CRT outcomes.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nVascular calcification is the major precursor to cardiovascular disease and is further\nexacerbated by chronic kidney disease. Black or African Americans are more than 3\ntimes as likely and Hispanics or Latinos are 1.3 times more likely to have kidney failure\ncompared to White Americans. In addition to Black Americans having higher rates of\nheart and kidney diseases, they also often live in rural or impoverished areas that are\nfood deserts. Low-income areas are more than often communities with a lack of access\nto healthy foods, otherwise known as food deserts. Heart disease and other CVCs such\nas chronic kidney disease, Stroke, and etc are the leading cause of death for African-\nAmericans, more so African-American males. While phosphate is a natural element that\nis found in meat and dairy products, it is also a known precursor to vascular calcification\nwhich leads to the onset of CVCs and other complications. The levels of phosphate in\nindustrially processed foods and meats are found to be much higher than levels in fresh\nproduce. Increased serum levels of inorganic phosphate leads to calcification of\nvascular smooth muscle cells and a phenotypic switch to an osteoblast-like cell. Once\nthought to be a passive process of calcium and phosphate deposition within arteries,\nvascular calcification is now known to be an active, cell-regulated condition. There is a\nclinical need to develop a therapy for vascular calcification that reduces calcification\nwithout causing arterial damage similar to current therapies such as endovascular stent\nand atherectomy. This project will examine the role of phosphate in vascular smooth\nmuscle cell calcification and the potential of protein therapy to reduce calcification. The\nproposed protein therapy would include reestablish fetuin-A to its native levels to treat\nsmooth muscle cell calcification in patients with the comorbidities of heart disease and\nchronic kidney disease. Fetuin-A forms in the liver, gets released into the blood stream,\nthen stabilizes free calcium-phosphate clusters into calciprotein particles that are filtered\nfrom the blood by the kidneys and excreted through urine. Through a collaboration with\nMSU Extension we will work to increase the diversity of the biomedical workforce while\nallowing the participants to give back to their communities and help older generations.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) experience a high symptomatic burden, heart failure and\nlethal arrhythmias. While HCM has been recognized as a disease of the sarcomere for >30 years, the disease\nmechanisms for sarcomeric gene variants are not well defined, limiting the precision and efficacy of treatment\noptions. Heterozygous variants in the gene myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3) cause half of all cases of\nfamilial HCM. About 15% of these are missense variants that cluster in interior protein domains C3 and C6\nwhich have uncertain binding partners or function. Computational predictions combined with our\npublished and preliminary experimental data support the hypothesis that missense variants in C3 and\nC6 domains lead to perturbation of multiple protein-protein interactions that are critical for the normal\nfunction of MyBP-C (the protein encoded by MYBPC3). In Aim 1 we will apply TurboID proximity labeling to\nwild-type (WT) and mutant MyBP-C. In preliminary data we have identified >200 novel and unique neighboring\nproteins to WT MyBP-C. Comparing C3 and C6 mutants to wild-type MyBP-C, relative abundances of\nsarcomeric, cytoskeletal and ribonucleoprotein complexes are reduced, while abundances of ribosomal and\nchaperone proteins are increased. We will explore consequences of these altered interactions by assessing\nchanges in myosin conformation, local translation, and chaperone-mediate protein turnover. We expect to find\nthat interactions with multiple proteins of diverse function are either strengthened or weakened by the presence\nof missense mutations in MyBP-C. Overcoming this perturbation in protein interactions with gene replacement\nby wild-type MyBP-C is the focus of Aim 2 where we will test the hypothesis that the mutant protein can be\nstoichiometrically replaced within the sarcomere by wild-type MyBP-C. We will transduce patient-derived\ninducible-pluripotent cardiomyocytes expressing C3 or C6 missense variants with adeno-associated viral\nvectors expressing wild-type MyBP-C or a lentiviral vector expressing a \u201ctitratable\u201d wild-type MyBP-C-FKBP12\nfusion protein that enables dose-response studies. The outcome measures will be the molar ratio of mutant to\nwild-type protein, and contractile and relaxation velocities. In vivo studies of gene replacement in a new\nArg506Trp MYBPC3 knock-in mouse model will complement the hiPSC-CM experiments. This application\nexplores several novel aspects of MyBP-C biology and features unique reagents and advanced proteomic\ntechniques. Successful completion of these aims will uncover new biology in MyBP-C by defining an expanded\nprotein neighborhood, by revealing disease mechanisms for missense MYBPC3 variants, and by testing a\ngene displacement strategy that leverages endogenous regulation of sarcomeric stoichiometry and could be\nbroadly applicable to missense variants in any sarcomere gene. Our investigative team, composed of a mix of\nsenior, highly experienced investigators and talented junior investigators with unique skill sets, is well poised to\nachieve these goals.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nThe current renewal proposal seeks to expand upon our successful initial award to clarify the mechanisms\nunderlying observed associations between alcohol use disorder (AUD) and suicidal behaviors (SB), including\nnon-fatal suicide attempts and suicide death. The research team has an extensive history of productive\ncollaborations, including in the realm of psychiatric and substance use disorder research. We have access to\nlongitudinal Swedish national registries including medical, criminal, census, family, and socioeconomic data for\nnearly 11 million individuals; these resources will be linked to create detailed datasets encompassing a wide\nrange of risk factors at individual, familial, and environmental levels. We will utilize these resources to extend\nour prior research through the pursuit of four specific aims. In the first aim we will evaluate how AUD and post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, or trauma exposure, relate via mediating or moderating pathways to risk of SB. We\nwill apply well-established methods, including those that facilitate causal inference. Second, we will directly\ncompare and contrast pathways to SB via AUD versus major depression (MD). AUD and MD constitute two\nprimary correlates/risk factors for SB, but much remains unknown about distinctions and commonalities between\nthese associations. The current proposal will focus primarily on the role of social dysfunction, with the goal of\nidentifying factors that may improve risk assessment. Third, we will consider how AUD relates to two common\nmedical conditions, cardiovascular disease and dementia, with respect to SB risk. Both conditions are\nthemselves associated with increased SB risk but whether they mediate and/or exacerbate the impact of AUD\nis not known. Finally, we will leverage our expertise in genetic epidemiology by pursuing analyses that will clarify\nhow aggregate genetic liability to AUD or SB, versus AUD and SB, is differentially related to psychopathology\nand other correlates of risk. Critically, Sweden and the US have comparable rates of suicidal behavior and share\nmany characteristics, including an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population; however, the US lacks\nregistry resources comparable to those available in Sweden. We expect that the statistical power of these\nregistries, in conjunction with the research team\u2019s extensive expertise in psychiatric and substance abuse\nresearch, social and genetic epidemiology, and causal modeling, will yield substantive findings on the\nrelationship between AUD and SB, with important implications for improving our efforts at SB prevention and\nintervention.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "MR-compatible Devices for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cardiomyopathies",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a non-invasive imaging technique with exquisite soft-tissue detail for the\nassessment of heart structure and function and provides an excellent screening tool but cannot always obviate\nmore invasive procedures, such as endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). Interventional CMR (iCMR) is a minimally\ninvasive technique without radiation, which has been hampered by the lack of non-ferrous devices that can be\neasily visualized, enabling the navigation of tasks, such as EMB, safely. Currently, one in nine deaths in the\nUS is attributed to heart failure (HF), with health care costs exceeding $30 billion in 2013. Of the ~5.1 million\nAmericans with HF, the definitive treatment is heart transplantation (HTx), where rejection is assessed with\nendomyocardial biopsy (EMB) \u2013 a procedure performed under X-ray guidance to obtain random samples of the\nright ventricular septum. However, many patients, especially children with cardiomyopathy and after HTx and\nHF caused by non-ischemic cardiomyopathies (NICM), do not have global changes to the myocardium, but\nrather, patchy disease, which is often restricted to limited portions of the left ventricle. Thus, EMB may yield a\ndefinitive diagnosis in <20% of the cases. As complications of EMB include ventricular puncture, pericardial\ntamponade, stroke, and death, the risk-benefit ratio of EMB limits its use. However, accurate diagnosis of\ncardiomyopathies or early recognition of heart rejection can lead to definitive treatment or measures to avoid\nheart rejection, respectively, with enormous individual patient impact. Therefore, we propose to develop an\nMRI-compatible suite of interventional devices to allow direct targeting of diseased myocardium (based on\nCMR) for EMB and treatment of cardiomyopathies, for both right- and left-sided catheterization. To this end,\nwe will develop an active pigtail catheter with a guidewire for iCMR cardiac catheterization to be used in\ncombination with an active MR-steerable sheath/bioptome device or transmyocardial injection catheter. These\ndevices will enable direct targeting of the disease to increase diagnostic yield and decrease complications.\nCurrently, there are no commercially available active MR-visible EMB, pigtail, or injection catheters. Significant\nadvances to our realization of a clinically relevant MR-EMB device include the creation of a sharp-jaw EMB\nmechanism that is safe from heating, but provides a specific MR signature when the device is open vs. closed,\nand injection devices that can determine myocardial apposition so that therapeutics reach the intended target\nof the myocardium. Furthermore, as pediatric HTx patients receive up to six EMBs in the first year, the iCMR\nsuite of devices will significantly reduce ionizing radiation in a particularly vulnerable population. Our research\nproposal will develop these devices in a canine model of spontaneous NICM that is similar in size to children's\nhearts to ensure these are compatible with pediatric interventions. Our extensive expertise in MRI\ninterventional devices and CMR will be used to achieve this objective.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Black-White coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart failure (HF) disparities persist in the US despite decades\nof research and national public health campaigns. The role of social determinants of health (SDH) like struc-\ntural racism in health disparities has been studied in only 1% of published work. Few studies of SDH have\ntaken a life course perspective related to risk of CHD and HF. The ability to recover after the stress of an acute\nhealth event, or resilience, is an important patient-centered outcome, but the influence of SDH on resilience is\nunknown. Few past studies have examined both structural and intermediary SDH in the World Health Organi-\nzation\u2019s (WHO) Commission on SDH (WHOCSD) conceptual framework in a longitudinal national sample with\nrigorously adjudicated CHD and HF endpoints, which is one of the aims of this proposal. We propose a series\nof studies to fill these gaps, while also providing rigorously adjudicated CHD and HF events and causes of\ndeath to a host of investigators interested in using these data (to date, over 500 have used these data). We\nbuild on a track record of mentoring to propose a formal year-long career development program for early-stage\ninvestigators (ESI), especially underrepresented minorities (URM). The specific aims of this proposal are to:\n(Aim 1) conduct studies examining underlying mechanisms of health disparities, guided by the WHOCSD con-\nceptual framework, in three thematic areas: a) the incidence and recurrence of CHD; b) the incidence and re-\ncurrence of HF with preserved ejection fraction and HF with reduced ejection fraction; c) reserve and resilience\nafter an incident or recurrent CHD or HF event. (Aim 2) To continue to adjudicate CHD events, HF hospitaliza-\ntions, and causes of death to support a wide range of studies by investigators beyond our group, and to link the\ncohort with Medicare data to support investigators conducting health services utilization studies. (Aim 3) To\nsupport the development of researchers in CVD health equity, especially URMs, through a new mentored re-\nsearch program for a cohort of ESIs, including analytic and statistical support and an annual 2-day Health Eq-\nuity Research Summer Institute of presentations, training, mock study section, and networking. ESIs will gradu-\nate with specific competencies in CVD health equity research. The proposed grant will inform policy, advocacy,\nand the design of interventions by generating new evidence on which SDH and disparities in health services\nlead to population-level disparities in incident and recurrent CHD and HF, and on resilience in recovery after a\nCHD or HF event. Our multidisciplinary team includes epidemiologists, sociologists, health services research-\ners, biostatisticians, clinicians, and a participant Advisory Board, assuring rigor and relevance of the proposed\nresearch. Continued funding for the REGARDS-MI infrastructure will support a host of additional studies led by\nan expanding group of investigators. Funding will also expand the cadre of researchers dedicated to discover-\ning strategies to achieve health equity for all US adults, a goal supported by NHLBI, the National Academy of\nSciences, the CDC, the American Heart Association, and all major professional societies in the US.",

Interventions that\nrapidly reverse bronchial obstruction and decrease the need for continuous beta-agonist therapy will not only\ndirectly benefit the patient, but also decrease the consumption of acute care resources. Bilevel positive airway\npressure (BPAP) is a form of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation that may stent open airways, improve\nmucous clearance, recruit alveoli, and increase responsiveness to continuous beta-agonist therapy in the small\ndistal airways. However, BPAP is not currently part of the NIH guidelines for the management of pediatric acute\nasthma secondary to the lack of quality pediatric clinical trials. The goal of this prospective, randomized, double\nblind, controlled trial is to determine if early initiation of BPAP is effective and safe in pediatric patients presenting\nto a pediatric emergency department with acute moderate to severe asthma exacerbations who fail first line\ntherapy.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nThis Fast Track STTR project focuses on developing and demonstrating a high-volume manufacturing\ntechnology for microfluidic oxygenators for applications requiring ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation\n(ECMO) to treat respiratory failure. Unlike heart disease and cancer, mortality from lung diseases continue to\nrise, and a combination of increasing patient populations suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\nand acute lung injury associated with respiratory infectious diseases and trauma represent an enormous health\ncare challenge in the US and across the world. The gold standard treatment for respiratory failure, invasive\nmechanical ventilation, carries significant risks of mechanical and biochemical injury to the lung along with\nmicrobial exposure. As a result, ECMO has emerged as an alternative therapy that allows injured lungs to rest,\ndirectly oxygenating and removing carbon dioxide from the blood in an extracorporeal circuit. However, ECMO\nuse is limited due to the extreme complexity of the blood circuit, which includes a hollow fiber membrane\noxygenator (HFMO) as the functional unit, and bioinspired microfluidic oxygenators capable of more safely\noxygenating the blood have emerged. Our preliminary data demonstrates the first large-scale, extended duration\nmicrofluidic oxygenators in large animals, with distinct safety and efficacy advantages over HFMO, but the\nmethod of construction is very complex and costly. We have engaged with high precision injection molding\ncompanies to identify a path to produce the devices at high volume and low cost, and the focus here is to develop\nand demonstrate the injection molded microfluidic oxygenator technology in safety and efficacy studies in a\nporcine model. Toward this end, we propose a fast track proposal comprising two phases and four overall aims.\nIn Phase I, we will 1) Define the target product profile for the adult clinical scale microfluidic oxygenator and\nconduct fluid mechanical and thermal modeling to identify the process window required for high yield injection\nmolding of these devices, 2) Iteratively apply computational models to verify the oxygen transfer and blood flow,\npressure and shear properties of oxygenators resulting from these designs, and 3) Build a casted replica of the\ninjection molding design to confirm gas transfer performance. Successful identification of a microfluidic\noxygenator design that meets the requirements from manufacturability, cost and performance perspectives will\nlead to advancement to Phase II of the program. Here we will 1) Fabricate the injection molds required for\nfabrication or larger numbers of microfluidic oxygenators at pediatric and adult scale, and 2) Test these pediatric\nand adult scale oxygenators in extended duration studies in porcine models to confirm safety and efficacy in\ncomparison with HFMO control devices. This demonstration of safety and efficacy, enabled by the high-volume\ninjection molding process developed on this project, will accelerate the advancement of the technology toward\ncommercialization and clinical translation for treatment of critically ill patients suffering from respiratory failure.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Scientific Abstract\nClonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP) is a condition of aging that has been associated with\nincreased risk of heart disease and heart failure. CHIP is evaluated by DNA sequencing of peripheral blood.\nHowever, not all patients with CHIP will develop heart failure or myocardial infarction. Our preliminary data\ndemonstrate that CHIP patients (cancer and non-cancer patients) have a higher burden of nonischemic scarring\nin their hearts on cardiac MRI compared to patients without CHIP. In a pilot cohort using a machine learning\ntechnique of convolutional neural networks (CNN), we are able to predict who have CHIP with 86% accuracy\nand predicted future cardiomyopathy with an accuracy of 73%, thus opening the door to possible image guided\nrisk stratification for identifying patients with CHIP as well as predict future cardiac outcomes. We also find\nthrough our novel deep learning algorithm that we can identify extended somatic variants that are CHIP-like that\ncan impact heart failure outcomes and through integration of patient data, genomic and imaging signatures, we\nare able to develop partition risk scores that can weigh the variables such as CHIP and their contribution to heart\nfailure and the pathways involved. We hypothesize that using cardiac MRI, novel machine learning\ntechniques on large imaging datasets can identify CHIP vs non-CHIP patients as well as predict who will\ndevelop adverse cardiovascular outcomes and that CNNs can be used on both imaging and genomic\nsignatures in large cohorts like the TOPMED, UKB and All of Us to predict cardiovascular outcomes\nwhile pathway analyses will reveal mechanisms and novel targets for CHIP-mediated cardiomyopathy\nSpecific Aim #1 will use a novel CNN with multi-view cross-attention to identify MRI features that can accurately\npredict CHIP as well as future adverse outcomes such as heart failure and myocardial infarction that will be\nvalidated in large datasets like TOPMed, UKB and All of Us with a collective ~13000 cardiac MRIs.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nCardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality affecting over 5% of Americans. Arrhythmias\nhave become increasingly prevalent due to an aging population with diabetes, heart failure and hypertension,\nwhich has led to an increasing number of invasive electrophysiology studies and catheter ablations. Our grasp\nof the cardiac arrhythmia mechanism, if it is focal or reentrant, and the specific location of the arrhythmia origin\nis limited by the current first-line, standard of care, noninvasive diagnostic test \u2014 the 12-lead electrocardiogram\n(ECG), which is dependent on physician subjective interpretation. Furthermore, it does not present the\narrhythmia in an easily visualized, three-dimensional, anatomical manner for patients or physicians to\nunderstand. Other noninvasive mapping techniques such as ECG imaging (ECGI) or virtual-heart technology,\nrequires additional preprocedural imaging such as computed tomography which exposes patient to radiation, or\nmagnetic resonance imaging which is costly. Over ten years, the collaborative team effort between Cardiac\nElectrophysiology and Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, has developed\nElectromechanical Wave Imaging (EWI), an ultrasound-based technique that takes 10-15 minute to non-\ninvasively image arrhythmias by visualizing the electromechanical wave corresponding to electromechanical\ncoupling. We have now developed a new technique, a full 3D EWI noninvasive ultrasound technique which can\nconstruct an entire 4 chamber cardiac activation map using a single heartbeat of arrhythmia acquired in one\napical transthoracic echocardiographic image. We propose three aims which will validate non-invasive 3D EWI\nto high density activation maps (HDAM) acquired during invasive electrophysiology study and demonstrate its\nclinical impact to shorten procedural times and improve clinical outcomes in a randomized clinical trial. We will\ndemonstrate that 3D EWI is an invaluable tool for pre-ablation planning to (1) provide target localization, (2)\ndiagnose the mechanism of the arrhythmia, as focal or macro-reentrant arrhythmia, useful in decision-making\nfor systemic anticoagulation and (3) improve ablation outcomes. We will study patients with manifest pre-\nexcitation such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, premature atrial complexes,\npremature ventricular complexes and ventricular tachycardia at two clinical sites, Columbia University (NY, NY)\nand Mount Sinai Medical Center (NY, NY).

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a serious condition of low cardiac output with a 40-50% mortality. In severe CS,\nhypoperfusion causes multi-organ failure and high left ventricle (LV) preload/wall stress exacerbates cardiac\ninjury/prevents recovery. Temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is needed to restore perfusion and\nunload the LV, bridging the CS patient to recovery, long-term LV assist device (LVAD), or heart transplant.\nVenoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is most often used in severe CS, but it fails to unload LV\nin > 50% of these patients with no improved outcomes. Minimally invasive, percutaneous MCS devices also do\nnot improve severe CS outcomes since they do not completely restore the circulation. Non-percutaneous MCS\ndevices provide total support but require open chest surgery and are not ambulation friendly. Impella 5.5 has\nbecome the preferred MCS device for CS. Yet, patients with an Impella 5.5 must stay in ICU with very limited\nambulation. Thus, a big market gap exists for an ideal temporary MCS device that: 1) is minimally invasive, 2)\nprovides total LV support, and 3) enables easy ambulation. Our goal is to develop a new temporary MCS\nsystem that provides total LV support via a minimally invasive technique with easy ambulation, enabling patient\ndischarge for at-home MCS. Our device will provide one month MCS (potential for up to 3 months) to bridge\nsevere CS patient to further treatment, recovery, durable VAD, or heart transplant. Our enabling technology\nis a single port, pulsatile ventricular assist device (sppVAD) system that includes valved single lumen cannula\n(VSLC), valveless single port diaphragm displacement pump (spDDP), and compact/portable console. Our\nsppVAD system has following novel design:1) One VSLC for withdrawal and infusion; 2) single lumen design\ndoubles usable area to reduce circuit blood resistance for >6 L/min pumping; 3) One transapical to aorta\ncannulation for minimally invasive installation; 4) Only one port reduces pump size for easy ambulation; 5)\nSimple valveless pump geometry for better durability and 1-month MCS. In the Phase I SBIR, our sppVAD\nsystem achieved >6 L/min pulsatile flow in bench test and 6 hr total LV unloading in sheep. Specific Aim 1:\nOptimize and fabricate VSLC, valveless spDDP, and compact/portable console for the sppVAD system.\nThe VSLC will be made of reinforced polyurethane (PU). Inlet valves will be in LV for blood withdrawal. A tri-\nleaflet outlet valve on VSLC tip will be in aorta for blood delivery. The spDDP will be made of polycarbonate\nwith a PU diaphragm. A compact/portable console will also be developed. Specific Aim 2: Bench test the\nsppVAD system for performance, durability, and hemocompatibility. The sppVAD system will be tested in\nmock loop for performance/durability and in an in vitro loop with bovine blood to quantify hemolysis. Specific\nAim 3: Perform 4-week preclinical testing of sppVAD system in sheep. A near commercial quality sppVAD\nsystem will be tested in sheep (n=10) for safety/biocompatibility/reliability. Our novel sppVAD system fills a\nlarge unmet need for ambulatory, at-home temporary total LV support to improve patient outcomes.",

After planning and internal\nand external advisory board evaluation, we propose to continue our research on three translational projects,\nprimarily targeting triple-negative breast cancer, with integrated guidance from patient advocates, to ensure\nthat we are inclusive of the patient perspective in meeting our goals. The projects are as follows: Project 2 -\nStrategies to Improve Outcomes for TNBC Patients Integrating Subtype-specific Genomic and Immune-based\nDiscoveries; Project 4 - Targeting Antigen Presentation to Improve Immunotherapy Responses in Breast\nCancer; and Project 5 \u2013 Liquid Biopsies to Guide Therapies in Triple-Negative Breast Cancers. The projects\nrequire three highly integrated shared core resources: Administration and Engagement, Biostatistics and\nBioinformatics, and Pathology and Tissue Informatics. The cores bring innovative technology, resources, and\npersonnel with project-specific expertise to the overall VICC Breast SPORE Program and do not duplicate pre-\nexisting shared resources available at VICC or Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC).

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Tau Oligomeric Complex 1 Antibody as a Novel Immuno-Gene Therapy for Tauopathy.",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nOligomeric tau species are a central instigator of dysfunction and degeneration in tauopathies, a group of\ndegenerative conditions encompassing Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and related dementias (i.e. tauopathies).\nSeveral passive and active anti-tau immunotherapeutics are currently undergoing preclinical and clinical testing,\nand there are high hopes for efficacy. However, substantial concerns exist because of the possibility that many\nof these agents are not specific for the right target (e.g., bind total or physiological tau) and/or are not efficiently\ndelivered to the right location (i.e., not intraneuronal). As an alternative strategy, we propose leveraging gene\ntherapy for the delivery of single chain fragment variables (scFvs) derived from an anti-Tau Oligomeric Complex\n1 (TOC1) antibody, will specifically target a toxic tau species (right targets) and provide robust intraneuronal\ndelivery non-invasively into the brain (right place). TOC1 specifically recognizes a conformation-dependent\nepitope in tau, necessitating tau dimerization or the formation of higher-order multimeric oligomers. Tau\noligomers are considered one of the earliest forms of tau pathology to emerge in human disease and are directly\nlinked to several cellular mechanisms causing neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Given the pivotal role of\noligomeric tau in disease pathogenesis, they are a prime target for therapeutic intervention. Using recombinant\nadeno-associated viruses (AAVs), we will deliver TOC1-scFv coupled to HaloTag protein and a proteasome\ndegradation signal (PDS) peptide for ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated breakdown of oligomeric tau. Advanced\nAAVs like the AAV CAP-B10 capsid provide a novel non-invasive route for systemic AAV delivery. We will deliver\nAAV-TOC1-scFv coupled to HaloTag protein and a proteasome degradation signaling (PDS) peptide for\nubiquitin-proteasome system-mediated breakdown of oligomeric tau species. We will test the hypothesis that\nTOC1-scFv-Halo-PDS will bind and target oligomeric tau species for degradation (Aim 1A), and systemic AAV-\nTOC1-scFv-Halo-PDS will efficiently express the scFv intraneuronally, subsequently rescuing the phenotype in\na mouse model of tauopathy (i.e. PS19 mutant tau mice; Aim 1B). Aim 1A involves the generation and validation\nof TOC1-scFv-Halo-PDS via assessing different scFv configurations (heavy chain/light chain and light\nchain/heavy chain) and measuring target engagement utilizing in-cell protein-protein interaction assays in a cell\nmodel of tauopathy. Aim 1B focuses on delivering TOC1-scFv-Halo-PDS using the AAV-CAP-B10 viral vector\nfor non-invasive systemic delivery and widespread CNS expression in PS19 mice. Expression in the CNS and\nperipheral organs will be tested using wild-type mice. Subsequently, a disease prevention study (AAV delivery\nin early disease) and a disease-modifying study (AAV delivery in mid-disease) will be conducted in PS19 mice.\nCognitive performance, scFv expression, target engagement, neurodegeneration (neurons, synapses, etc.), tau\nneuropathology and neuroinflammation will be measured. Successful project completion will conclusively\ndetermine the potential of AAV-TOC1-scFv-Halo-PDS as a highly novel immuno-gene therapy for tauopathy.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Immunoproteostasis refers to the relationship between the immune system, proteinopathies present in many\nneurodegenerative disorders, and brain cell dysfunction. The relevance of immunoproteostasis to Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n(AD) is supported by genetic, pathological, and modeling studies. In AD, as in cancer, multiple lines of evidence now\nsupport the benefits of immune activating therapies, but for AD this concept is not settled science. More generally,\nmanipulation of the immune activation states regardless of \u201cdirection\u201d, has potential for harm as well as benefit. The\noverarching goal of these studies is to determine whether we can identify immune manipulations in preclinical models of\namyloid pathology that potentially fall within a \u201cGoldilocks zone\u201d- where disease modification, with minimal or no\ndamage, is achieved. We propose three aims that will test our global hypothesis that it is possible to identify immune\nmodulatory therapies that fall within a Goldilocks zone. In aim 1, we will systematically evaluate liabilities and benefits of\nimmune manipulations that have been shown to modulate immunoproteostasis in amyloid depositing mice. In aim 2, we\nwill survey a broader set of immune manipulations targeting putative microglial immune checkpoints to evaluate whether\na manipulation of any of these checkpoints falls within the Goldilocks zone. In aim 3, we will evaluate whether targeting\nof immune modulating factors to the plaque microenvironment can maintain or increase beneficial impact on AD relevant\npathologies while reducing potential liabilities. Several overarching principles provide a framework for these studies. First,\nas the balance of positive and negative effects of any immune manipulation may limit therapeutic benefit, we will use\ntranscriptomic and proteomic analyses, assessments of pathology, and assays of synaptic number and function to assess\ndisease modifying potential and liabilities more broadly and systematically. Second, we will focus on non-cell autonomous\nmanipulations of immune signaling pathways, as such studies are more likely to identify translatable interventions. Third,\nwe will evaluate whether we can increase efficacy and limit liabilities by more precisely targeting the immune\nmanipulations to the plaque microenvironment. The studies are highly translational, as they can validate novel approaches\nto immune modulatory therapies for AD. Finally, these studies have relevance beyond the AD field, as they broadly explore\nimmune checkpoints in the brain and thus the data generated may inform studies relating to immuno-oncology of the\nbrain and other neuroimmune disorders.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Cellular immunotherapies like Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells (CAR-T) extend the lives of\ncancer patients who are otherwise out of options. These therapies represent a leap forward in\ncancer treatment but suffer from severe limitations because 1) the tumor microenvironment\nexcludes and exhausts T cells including CAR-T cells, 2) some tumor cells escape by\ndownregulating the target antigen, 3) the therapy incites cytokine storms and autoimmune\nreactions, and 4) cellular therapies are currently complex, time-consuming, and exorbitantly\nexpensive. Here we propose to overcome these limitations and thereby revolutionize,\ngeneralize, and democratize cellular immunotherapies. A promising new cellular immunotherapy\napproach is CAR-M (macrophage). Two Phase 1 clinical trials are in progress and it is clear that\nthe approach is safe though there is substantial room for improvement in efficacy. While CAR-M\nhas many advantages over CAR-T, it is clear that it would be of great value to enhance the\ncapacity of CAR macrophages to attack and kill cancer cells while sparing normal tissue. Based\non fundamental cell and developmental biology we have been doing in fruit flies, we discovered\nhow to greatly increase the ability of human macrophages to attack and kill specific whole target\ncells of our choosing. Inspired by our discovery in fruit flies, we have been able to engineer\nmouse and human macrophages to avidly and specifically engulf and kill cancer cells. Here we\npropose to test this approach against the most prevalent solid tumors like breast, lung, and\ncolon, and against hard-to-treat cancers like ovarian, pancreatic, and glioblastoma. Another\nhuge limitation of cellular immunotherapies is their cost and complexity. We propose to\novercome this problem by greatly simplifying the production and delivery of CAR-M. We\npropose to transform CAR-M into an affordable, off-the-shelf therapy. This will enable\ngeneralization of the approach to hard-to-treat diseases beyond cancer, such as multidrug\nresistant bacteria, viral and fungal infections, autoimmune diseases, and more.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "An Innovative Immune Therapy Targeting the TREM1-Inflammation Pathway to Alleviate Excess Inflammation in Ulcerative Colitis of Geriatric Patients",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\n One million Americans live with Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and 30% of that population is over 60. Thirty-eight\nthousand new cases are diagnosed yearly, with 15% over 65. More than a quarter of UC patients are aged,\nand prevalence in the over 65 is increasing at an annual rate of 2.8%. Surgery treatment is risky in geriatric\npatients, and better therapy is needed. UC is an immune-mediated disorder of the colon that is debilitating and\nnot medically curable. Extensive studies have shown a pathogenesis due to aberrant immune responses to the\nintestinal microbiota, resulting in acute and chronic inflammations characterized by infiltrates of activated\nmacrophages (M\u03a6), neutrophils (Ns), and lymphocytes, indicating a deregulated activation of the intestine-\ninnate immunity responder cells (M\u03a6 and Ns). In UC, correlating with this deregulation is the unusual\nexpression of the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells-1 (TREM1) on the intestinal M\u03a6 and the\npresence of activated platelets expressing a ligand for TREM1. TREM1 is a potent activation receptor of M\u03a6\nand Ns, and its excess triggering leads to the overproduction of inflammatory mediators and excess\ninflammation. Two-thirds of patients obtain only partial or no benefit from current therapies, specifically those\nwith M\u03a6 high-TREM1 expression sustained inflammation. Over 1400 scientific articles document the role of the\nTREM1-activation pathway (TAP) in inflammation. We have identified TREM1-sv, a natural splice variant and\ncompetitive inhibitor of TREM1, which can downregulate TAP. TREM1-sv was very efficient at downregulating\nexcess inflammation in preclinical sepsis trials, a disease driven by a deregulated TAP. In UC, deregulation of\nTAP might occur from depletion of TREM1-sv, ensuing persistent activation of myeloid cells from activated\nplatelets. We anticipate that administering TREM1-sv intravenously or subcutaneously will stop the excess\ninflammation. The rationale is that TREM1-sv downregulates TAP by competing for the TREM1 ligands,\nthereby reducing the number of TREM1-ligand complexes and avoiding an excess triggering activation of M\u03a6\nand Ns. Hence, the intestine can recover a healthy immunity and heal. We aim to show therapeutic efficacy by\nconducting experiments in which different regimens of TREM1-sv are administered to well-established mouse\nmodels of chronic ulcerative colitis with altered innate immunity. We use a custom-made strain of P. pastoris to\nproduce a batch of purified biologically active human recombinant (hu r) TREM1-sv for animal treatments. After\ninduction of UC, inflammation will be assessed before and after hu rTREM1-sv treatment with an established\nfour-parameter UC scoring system and correlated with measurements in the blood of the inflammatory cytokine\nlevels and TREM1-sv concentration. Neutralization experiments with an anti-TREM1-sv antibody and\ncomparative anti-TNF therapy will be conducted. We aim to produce innovative data demonstrating the benefit\nof hu rTREM1-sv to downregulate hyperactive intestinal inflammation in UC. Downregulating TAP with hu\nrTREM1-sv is an innovative scientific approach to alleviate excess inflammation in UC patients.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Restoring Tolerance in Inflammatory Bowel Disease with an Oral AMPK agonist Nanomedicine that Targets Antigen Presenting Cells.",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nIn the United States alone, approximately 3.1 million adult patients suffer from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),\na group of disorders characterized by chronic or recurring inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Although\nseveral therapeutics, including anti-TNF antibodies, have been approved for the treatment of IBD, many patients\ndo not respond to current treatments or experience relapse, highlighting an urgent need for the development of\nmore effective long-term therapies.\nAntigen presenting cell (APC) dysfunction drives IBD initiation by encouraging a breakdown in intestinal\nhomeostasis and promoting pathogenic proinflammatory circuits against harmless commensal microbes.\nAlthough APCs are considered critical to IBD pathogenesis, there have been no APC-targeted therapies\ndeveloped to date for the treatment of IBD. Qrono Inc is developing QR401, a first-in-class, oral, APC-specific\nAMPK pathway agonist for the treatment of IBD. QR401 uses custom nanoparticles to directly promote an AMPK-\ninduced immunoregulatory APC phenotype. This work is inspired by studies demonstrating 1) that the AMPK\npathway is downregulated by intestinal APCs in IBD patients and 2) that activation of the AMPK pathway via oral\nor systemic administration of AMPK pathway agonists can successfully alleviate disease severity in preclinical\nmouse studies. While AMPK has long been a target of interest for IBD, clinical development of AMPK agonists\nhas been limited by severe adverse effects associated with systemic administration including metabolic\ncomplications (i.e. lactic acidosis) and cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, approaches like the one we propose that can\ntarget AMPK agonists specifically to intestinal APCs are vital to safely activating the AMPK pathway that\u2019s\ndampened in IBD and restoring tolerance. Our preliminary data identify the AMPK agonist PF-739 as having\ntolerogenic activity, marked by a dampening of pro-inflammatory IL-12p70 production coupled with a significant\nincrease in anti-inflammatory IL-10 secretion in LPS stimulated dendritic cells (DCs), features that promote Treg\ninduction. We hypothesize that targeting AMPK-activating compounds to APCs will decrease intestinal\ninflammation during experimental colitis and human IBD without the metabolic and cardiac risks\nhistorically associated with untargeted AMPK agonists. Accordingly, we will prepare and characterize\nenteric-coated nanoparticles of PF-739 (QR401) that can be used for the proposed in vivo studies.\nSuccessful completion of this project will establish proof-of-concept for a first-in-class APC-targeted\nimmunotherapy for IBD. A future Phase II STTR proposal would continue development in IND-enabling studies.\nQrono is committed to developing oral tolerogenic therapies for IBD, and these data will help us raise private\ninvestment necessary for future clinical trials.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that leads to cognitive decline and\ndementia. The disease imposes emotional and financial burdens on patients and their families, with over 5.8\nmillion adults in the US alone affected by AD. The number of cases is expected to double by 2050, with\nestimated costs exceeding $1 trillion. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective management and prevention of AD,\nbut current diagnostic methods like neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis have limitations in terms of\ncost, availability, and invasiveness. Blood-based biomarkers offer a promising alternative for accessible and\nrepeated measurements.\nRecent advancements in blood-based biomarkers, including amyloid-beta (A\u03b2), phosphorylated tau (pTau),\nand Neurofilament Light chain (NfL), show potential in diagnosing and tracking AD. Plasma A\u03b2 levels can\ndetect abnormalities before the onset of dementia symptoms, while elevated concentrations of specific pTau\nisoforms are strongly associated with clinically diagnosed AD. NfL serves as a broad indicator of\nneurodegeneration. These biomarkers align with findings from CSF and PET methodologies, presenting\nopportunities for transforming AD diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring.\nDespite the FDA approval of immunoassays for amyloid plaques and pTau, there is a significant lack of\ncommercially available point-of-care (POC) blood tests for AD. Existing blood-based AD tests are lab-specific,\nbulky, expensive, and require specialized equipment. The EU/US Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease\n(CTAD) Task Force emphasizes the urgent need for user-friendly, accurate, and accessible tests, particularly\nin primary care settings. Implementing POC testing alongside cognitive assessment could reduce specialist\nvisits, shorten wait times, and generate significant cost savings for healthcare systems.\nTo address these challenges, we propose to develop a smartphone-based POC diagnostic system. The\nsystem utilizes microfluidics, nanotechnology, optical sensing, and deep learning to detect AD-related\nbiomarkers (A\u03b242, A\u03b240, pTau181, pTau217, pTau231, and \u039dfL) in blood-plasma within 30 minutes. The goal\nis to create an affordable (<$5 material costs), disposable, and mass-producible microfluidic cartridge that\nenables rapid and sensitive (LoD<10pg/mL) detection using platinum nanoparticles to generate visible optical\nsignal (bubbles). This innovation has the potential to fill the gap in AD management by providing an accessible\nand cost-effective tool for comprehensive blood-based biomarker testing, improving screening, monitoring, and\ntreatment efficacy for individuals affected by AD.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project summary:\n Chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cells have transformed the cancer therapy paradigm by genetically\nengineering a patient's own T cells to specifically kill cells expressing the targeted antigen, such as CD19 for B\ncell malignancies. CART cell proliferation and formation of memory CART cells result in complete B cell\ndepletion and durable remission of otherwise refractory B cell cancers. We re-designed CART technology for\nautoimmune disease therapy by utilizing an autoantigen as the extracellular domain of a chimeric autoantibody\nreceptor (CAAR), linked to cytoplasmic T cell receptor costimulatory and activation domains. CAARs direct T\ncell cytotoxicity against autoantigen-specific B cells by targeting their B cell receptor, a surface-bound\nautoantibody identical in specificity to the autoantibody the B cell will secrete once activated to mature into a\nplasmablast. We established proof-of-concept for CAAR safety and efficacy in experimental models of\npemphigus vulgaris (PV), a potentially fatal blistering disease caused by autoantibodies to the epithelial\nadhesion protein desmoglein 3 (DSG3). If CAARs for autoimmunity prove to be as effective as CARs for B cell\ncancers, CAAR T cells could represent a one-time treatment leading to autoimmune disease cure.\n An open-label, dose-escalation, first-in-human phase 1 trial to determine the safety and tolerability of\nDSG3 CAAR T cell therapy (DSG3-CAART) in mucosal-dominant pemphigus vulgaris has been initiated.\nDSG3-CAART is the first precision cellular immunotherapy for autoimmune disease to enter clinical trials,\nwhich presents a unique opportunity to define the immunomodulatory effects of this novel therapeutic approach\nin humans. DSG3-CAART is designed to specifically eliminate DSG3-reactive memory B cells that replenish\nthe autoantibody-producing plasmablasts in PV. Depletion of anti-DSG3 memory B cells could remove a key\ndriver of DSG3-specific T cell activation, and DSG3-CAART persistence may induce changes in global T cell\nsubset composition and/or cytokine milieu, resulting in dual mechanisms for disease remission through both\nthe B and T cell compartments. The proposal will evaluate the hypothesis that DSG3-CAART will reset immune\ntolerance in PV by depleting DSG3-reactive B cells and normalizing pathologic T cell subsets, potentially\nleading to safe and lasting disease remission.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nImmune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized the therapeutic landscape of patients with metastatic cancer.\nHowever, despite remarkable outcomes in some patients, only a minority achieves complete and durable clinical\nresponse. To overcome this, combination of radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade has gained\npopularity to turn up the heat on cold tumors. While tumor irradiation can elicit an immunogenic cell death\ntriggering tumor antigen presentation and T-cell priming, immune checkpoint blockade can enhance the\nexpansion of tumor-reactive T cells which culminates with regression of distant non-irradiated metastases,\nreferred as \u201cabscopal effect\u201d. The synergy of radiotherapy and current immune checkpoint blockade has shown\nto improve oncological outcomes in some patients but rates of abscopal effect remain scarce. Our long-term\ngoals are to develop new effective therapeutic combinations to boost abscopal response and improve clinical\noutcome of patients with advanced cancers. To that end, there is a critical need to shed the light on the underlying\nmechanisms of poor response to radiotherapy. Our group has generated compelling functional evidence\nimplicating the immune checkpoint molecule B7-H3 as a key mediator of tumor immune evasion that may act\nboth locally by impairing T cell-mediated cytotoxicity and systemically through release of immunomodulatory\ntumor-derived extracellular vesicles (tdEVs). The overall objectives in this application are to gain a better\nunderstanding of the role of B7-H3 In local and systemic antitumor immunity and evaluate the therapeutic\npotential of targeting B7-H3 function with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In line with this, our central hypothesis\nis that tumor B7-H3 acts as a \u201cdon\u2019t touch me\u201d signal which inhibits the cytotoxic function of CD8 T cells. We will\ntest this hypothesis through two aims. In Aim 1, we will dissect the mechanisms of B7-H3-induced CD8 T cell\ndysfunction. To that end, we will use proximity labeling technologies and time-lapse imaging of T-cell mediated\ncytotoxicity. We will also employ immunocompetent mouse models humanized for B7-H3 to evaluate the safety\nand therapeutic efficacy of a newly developed B7-H3 inhibitor. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanisms of\nsystemic immunosuppression mediated by B7-H3+ tdEVs in response to radiotherapy using genetically\nengineered mouse tumor cells and in vivo proximity-dependent biotinylation. We have assembled a multi-\ndisciplinary team with complementary expertise in extracellular vesicle biology, radiation oncology, tumor\nimmunology and proteomics to validate B7-H3 as a therapeutic target to boost abscopal response in patients\nwith advanced cancers treated with radiotherapy.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is an inexorable and devastating neurodegenerative disease affecting mil-\nlions of Americans. There are no therapies that could stop or reverse the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease, in part because the basic factors driving neuronal death and dysfunction are unknown. There\nis a critical need to better understand the basic biology of AD in order to develop new disease-modify-\ning treatments.\nA key contributing factor to AD is impaired glucose metabolism. Several observations support this con-\nclusion. First, aging is a major AD risk factor that impairs brain glucose metabolism, reduces mitochon-\ndrial biogenesis, and decreases ATP levels. Second, neurodegeneration in AD can be directly quanti-\nfied by imaging glucose metabolism via techniques such as 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron\nemission tomography (PET). Third, metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes are key risk fac-\ntors for AD. Fourth, interventions that improve metabolism such as exercise, calorie restriction, and\ntreatment for diabetes can mitigate the risk and progression of AD. Last but not least, Aerobic glycoly-\nsis, which can be measured by FDG-PET and 15O-PET in vivo imaging, is compromised in patients with\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease.\nDespite these data, it is unknown how glucose metabolism contributes to neurodegenerative pro-\ncesses in AD. Our recent work demonstrated that we can enhance one aspect of brain glucose metab-\nolism, glycolysis, via an existing drug, terazosin (TZ). This drug is an alpha-1 antagonist, but also acti-\nvates the first ATP-generating step of glycolysis, phosphoglycerate kinase-1 (PGK1). In this proposal,\nwe will interrogate glycolysis in rodent models of AD, including tau and amyloid mouse lines, while\nmeasuring metabolomics, cognitive function, 18F-FDG-PET, and protein aggregation. Our overall hy-\npothesis is that glycolysis critically regulates neurodegeneration in AD. Our specific aims investigate if\ndisrupting glycolysis affects rodent AD models and if improving glycolysis mitigates neurodegeneration\nin AD. Because this is a fundamental mechanism, our work could have far-reaching impact for neuro-\ndegenerative diseases, and could be instrumental in inspiring novel disease-modifying therapies for\nAD and related diseases.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nGlioblastoma (GBM) is a deadly brain tumor with limited treatment options. We have developed a promising new\ntreatment for GBM using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells. CAR-T cells are derived from the patient\u2019s\nown T cells and genetically modified to express a receptor that will target the cancer cells through a specific\nantigen. We first developed CAR-T cells targeting epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII), a\nmutated form of EGFR that is uniquely expressed in GBM. Treating patients with EGFRvIII-CAR-T cells resulted\nin decreased EGFRvIII-expressing cells, while EGFR expression remained the same or increased. With\nEGFRvIII-CAR-T cell treatment, there was also infiltration of T regulatory cells (Tregs), which are known to\nsuppress T cell function and may have limited CAR-T cell killing of tumor cells. To improve this therapy, we\nengineered the EGFRvIII-CAR-T cell to secrete a T cell-engaging antibody molecule (TEAM) that binds to EGFR\nand CD3 (CARv3.TEAM-E cells). The TEAM allows the CAR-T cell to target more than one antigen while also\nactivating other (non-CAR) T cells within the tumor, including converting Tregs to killer cells. We tested\nCARv3.TEAM-E cells in vitro and in mouse xenograft models and found they safely and effectively target\nEGFRvIII+EGFR+ and EGFRvIII\u2013EGFR+ GBM. When these cells were injected into the mouse brain for direct\naccess to the tumor, very few escaped into the peripheral circulation, which protected normal tissues with EGFR\nexpression from being targeted by the TEAM. Based on these preclinical results, we are initiating a phase I\nclinical trial of the CARv3.TEAM-E cells for the treatment of primary or recurrent GBM. The CARv3.TEAM-E cells\nwill be injected into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via an Ommaya reservoir. We will measure the safety of this\ntreatment by monitoring patients for adverse events related to CAR-T treatment and EGFR targeting.\nAdditionally, we will perform correlative studies to monitor CAR-T cell expansion, persistence, and phenotype in\nthe CSF and peripheral blood as well as infiltration into the tumor. We will examine the tumor for changes in\nantigen expression (EGFRvIII, EGFR, etc.) with CARv3.TEAM-E cell infiltration and changes in other immune\ncells that could be influencing CARv3.TEAM-E cell function, including Tregs and myeloid cells. We will correlate\nthese parameters with responses to treatment or toxicities that we observe in each patient. Overall, these studies\nwill inform us about the safety and feasibility of CARv3.TEAM-E cells for treating GBM, as well as provide insights\ninto future modifications that could improve the efficacy of these CAR-T cells or lessen their side effects.\nCARv3.TEAM-E cells hold promise for improving the outcome of this dismal disease.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nThe impressive success of cancer immune therapy reached its limitations and failed in its efficacy with immune\ndeserted KRAS mutated tumors that constitute 45% of colorectal cancers. These patients have fewer\ntreatment options necessitating the development of effective alternate therapy. Of late reovirus, with a double-\nstranded RNA genome, showed therapeutic efficacy in an oncogenic KRAS transformed colorectal tumors.\nAlthough previously studied for its oncolytic properties reovirus is being increasingly appreciated for its immune\nstimulation properties. However, its participation in immune stimulation, precisely utilizing two intimately related\nimmune and autophagic modulatory pathways, remains largely unexplored. Preliminary results indicate that\nreovirus preferentially exploits the immune deserted mutant KRAS tumor microenvironment to successfully\nsupport its propagation in conjunction with destruction of the tumor cells. Furthermore, reovirus induces\nautophagy in KRAS mutated microenvironment. Knowledge gaps: It is crucial to understand the mechanism\nadopted by reovirus to facilitate the immune enrichment of mutant KRAS driven immune deserted\nmicroenvironment in colorectal cancer. The contribution of autophagic pathway in accentuating the process is\nunclear. Understanding the control mechanism between the autophagy and immune pathways is critical.\nProject hypothesis: The dual mode of action exerted by reovirus can be successfully translated to the clinic by\naugmenting the induction of the autophagy pathway. We propose to study the pattern of reovirus mediated\ninduction of the autophagic machinery and determine how the molecular event is translated in improving the\nimmune stimulation characteristics in KRAS mutated colorectal Cancer. In this context we will make use of\nKRAS mutant and wildtype colorectal cancer cell lines and our newly developed KPC:APC (tamoxifen-\ninducible KRAS-mutated colorectal cancer) mouse models along with the well-established syngeneic mouse\nmodel of colorectal cancer to mechanistically explore the process of crosstalk between the two pathways.\nResults will improve the understanding of the dynamics of KRAS mutated immune deserted cold tumors in\nfacilitating reovirus to act as an immune stimulator Impact: This project will have dual impact of providing an\nenriched biomedical science related research environment to the aspiring undergraduate students as well as to\ndirectly address the clinical gap faced by the KRAS mutated colorectal cancer patients. Understanding the\nmechanism of cross talk between the autophagy and immune pathways followed by research supported\nrecommendation of therapeutic induction of autophagy to improve immune therapy responsiveness of KRAS\nmutated colorectal cancer will be of paradigm clinical implications. In this pursuit we will AIM1: Demonstrate\ncrosstalk between autophagy and immune pathways in reovirus treated KRAS mutant and wildtype colorectal\ncancer cell lines. AIM2: Examine if autophagy induction promotes reovirus mediated immune stimulation in\nKRAS mutated cold colorectal tumors in transgenic and syngeneic mouse models.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "SUMMARY: Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common cancer diagnosed in children younger than one year old\nand is the most frequent solid tumor in children < 5 years of age. Those with high-risk disease have only a 40-\n50% survival rate. For locally advanced and metastatic disease, high-dose chemotherapy is the primary modality\nof treatment. Irradiation of the primary tumor bed is commonly undertaken after surgery for those with the MYC\nproto-oncogene family that encodes basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor N (MYCN) amplified tumors,\ncorrelated with high-risk cancers and poor prognosis. Despite the introduction of immunotherapies, the five-year\nsurvival remains below 50%. NanoPharmaceuticals LLC is developing a novel dual targeting ligand for the\ntreatment of high-risk NB through a combination of a plasma membrane integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 antagonist and uptake of\na metabolically stable norepinephrine structural analogue via high norepinephrine transporter (NET) expression\ntypical of NB and other neuroendocrine cancers. BG-P-TAT is our novel chemical entity containing triazole tetrac\n(TAT), a derivative of L-thyroxine, and benzylguanidine (BG), covalently bound to a 1600 MW polyethylene glycol\n(PEG), P1600-TAT. P1600-TAT has a substantial panel of anticancer actions (antiproliferation, pro-apoptosis, anti-\nangiogenesis) mediated by its binding to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, a plasma membrane protein preferentially expressed and\nactivated by cancer cells. BG binds to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) expressed on the surface of\nneuroendocrine cells, conferring additional binding affinity and tumor specificity. Our in vivo studies of tumor cell\ntargeting showed that BG-P1600-TAT (NanoPharma 855: NP855) had 70-95% tumor shrinkage in two cell lines.\nThis Direct to Phase II SBIR will establish IND-enabling therapeutic efficacy and safety of NP855 following scaled\nup manufacturing. Aim 1. Evaluation of efficacy and PK of NP855 using scaled up product. The objective\nis to confirm in vitro and in vivo efficacy in NB cells and tumors following scaled up manufacturing of non-GMP\ndrug material. Tasks include (1.1) Production of NP855 following process transfer, analytical evaluation, lab\ndemo batch production, and reference standard qualification; (1.2) In vitro confirmation of integrin binding affinity\nand NET engagement by measuring uptake kinetics in NB cells versus normal cell line; (1.3) In vivo evaluation\nof anti-cancer efficacy (tumor growth, NP855 tumor uptake, tumor histopathology for cancer viability and anti-\nangiogenic efficacy using anti-CD31 tumor immunostaining) and PK in mice. Goals: (a) Production of 500g of\ndrug substance for formulation of the drug product (DP) with reference standard qualification; (b) Confirmation\nof efficacy findings using scaled up DP. Aim 2. Perform IND-enabling toxicology evaluations. We will conduct\nnon-GLP (14 days) and GLP (28 days) dose range finding and repeated dose studies in rodent (rat) and non-\nrodent (minipig) as well as in vitro assessments of solubility, stability, protein binding, transporter and cytochrome\ninhibition. In vivo central nervous system, respiratory, and cardiovascular assessments will be completed. Goal:\nEstablish safety and toxicokinetics for NP855 in two species for IND preparation.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nProstate cancer (PC) is the most common cancer in men, and the second leading cause of cancer death among\nmen in the United States. There is a critical unmet need to develop novel, efficacious therapeutics for PC. NUAgo\nTherapeutics, Inc. is developing an RNA-interference-based therapeutic for PC based on research conducted at\nNorthwestern University into a naturally occurring anti-cancer mechanism. This research identified a class of\nshort (19-22 nt long) double-stranded (ds) interfering RNA molecules (here termed \u201csRNAs\u201d) that potently target\ngenes that are essential for cancer cell survival. These sRNAs are derived from CAG trinucleotide repeat (TNR)\nsequences that are found in genes associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including huntingtin\n(the cause of Huntington\u2019s disease) and the androgen receptor (AR) gene (the cause of spinobulbar muscular\natrophy [SBMA]/Kennedy disease). Both diseases are associated with reduced cancer incidence. Evidence\nindicates that CAG expansions lead to increased production of short interfering RNAs that bind to complementary\ntranscripts and downregulate their expression. sRNAs containing the CAG repeat (\u201csCAG\u201d) are extremely toxic\nto cancer cells by targeting highly expressed CUG repeat-containing genes, providing both a mechanistic\nexplanation for the reduced incidence of cancer in patients with certain neurodegenerative diseases and a novel\ntherapeutic approach for cancer treatment. PC is a particularly attractive target for this novel therapeutic\napproach. The number of CAG repeats in the AR gene is inversely correlated with PC incidence, the\naggressiveness of the disease, and the risk of distant metastasis. Longer CAG repeats thus appear to have an\nanti-tumor effect, suggesting susceptibility of PC cells to sCAG. The goal of this STTR project is to develop an\nsCAG-based therapeutic, which will be delivered to cells using lipopolyplex (LPP) nanoparticles, to treat PC. In\nAim 1, the uptake and activity of sCAG-LPP (\u201cNU002\u201d) will be evaluated in mouse models of prostate cancer,\nquantifying both sCAG delivery and silencing activity in PC cells in vivo. Uptake and activity of the NU002 and a\nnon-toxic control sRNA will be evaluated in both tumor and normal cells in four mouse models, including two\nxenograft models of PC and a syngeneic PC model. Uptake will be monitored by fluorescently labeling the\nsRNAs, while silencing activity will be measured using a fluorescent reporter gene that includes a corresponding\ntarget sequence. RNA sequencing will be used to measure the expression of target genes in tumors. In Aim 2,\nthe anti-tumor effects of NU002 will be characterized in vivo in the same four xenograft and syngeneic models\nas in Aim 1, measuring the effect on excised tumor size at 4-6 weeks post-treatment. Histological and liver\nenzyme analyses will be used to examine toxicity in normal tissues, and RNA sequencing will again be performed\non tumor and normal tissue samples to quantify the expression of targeted genes. This Phase I work will provide\nproof-of-concept data supporting future work that will focus on preclinical IND-enabling studies and formulation\ndevelopment in preparation for a first-in-human clinical trial.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY \u2013 NO CHANGES FROM PARENT GRANT\nRigorous data from our lab and others indicate that the gut microbiome may an underappreciated contributor to\ninter-individual variations in cancer drug efficacy and side effect profiles; however, we currently lack the\nmechanistic insights and data from preclinical mouse models necessary to inform ongoing studies in cancer\npatients. We selected fluoropyrimidines, including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and its prodrug capecitabine (CAP), as\nan initial test case due to their critical role in colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy, increasing oral administration,\nhighly variable pharmacokinetics, and unexplained differences in efficacy and toxicity. We propose a series of\nin vitro and mouse studies to dissect the human gut bacterial species, genes, and enzymes responsible for the\nmetabolism of 5-FU (Aim 1) and CAP (Aim 2), including their downstream consequences for drug\npharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD).\nOur overarching hypothesis is that the oral bioavailability and therapeutic effects of fluoropyrimidines\nare influenced by pathways for drug metabolism encoded by diverse human gut bacterial species.\nIn Aim 1, we will identify and characterize the primary gut bacterial taxon responsible for 5-FU inactivation\nthrough a combination of biochemical and cell-based assays coupled to studies in gnotobiotic and xenograft\nmouse models. Based on our Preliminary Results, we hypothesize that Anaerostipes is the primary gut\nbacterial genus responsible for inter-individual variations in the metabolism of 5-FU.\nIn Aim 2, we seek to discover the bacterial enzymes responsible for the activation of CAP to 5-FU, motivated\nby the surprising finding that E. coli can activate CAP leading to reduced bacterial growth at high\nconcentrations. We hypothesize that E. coli catalyzes a 3-step metabolic pathway that mirrors the mammalian\nconversion of CAP to 5-FU.\nOur results in Aim 1 will provide a valuable proof-of-principle for dissecting the conservation and redundancies\nin clinically relevant microbial biotransformations, helping to move beyond studies of model gut bacteria to\nidentify the most translationally relevant species. Aim 2 is potentially paradigm-shifting in that it would provide\ndefinitive evidence for CAP bioactivation outside of hepatocytes and cancer cells, creating new opportunities to\nimprove treatment outcomes and study the physiological role and broader impacts of this metabolic pathway.\nTaken together, this research plan emphasizes the conservation of the pathways for metabolism of\ntherapeutics across domains of life, highlighting the need to distinguish the relative contributions of human and\nmicrobial cells to drug disposition, efficacy, and side effect profiles. Due to our focus on drugs used as current\nstandard of care and naturally occurring bacterial species prevalent in the human gut microbiome, this\npreclinical research program has clear translational relevance and is highly synergistic with ongoing clinical\nstudies of cancer patients conducted by our team and the broader microbiome field.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Multimodal dendrimer theranostics targeting aggressive subtypes of prostate cancer",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nOur ultimate goal is to develop a practical, theranostic platform for managing PC. Prostate cancer (PC) is the\nsecond most common cancer and the fifth most frequent cause of cancer death among men. Despite a gradually\nimproving trend in outcomes, the current death rate remains unacceptably high, with metastases in 20% of\nafflicted men. The American Cancer Society estimates approximately 268,490 new cases and 34,500 deaths\nfrom PC in the United States in 2022. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression has been\nassociated with aggressive PC, and is present in over 90% of metastatic disease. Those features have led to\nemploying PSMA for PC detection with radionuclide imaging, and for therapies including antibody-drug\nconjugates, targeted radiotherapeutics and immunotherapeutic approaches. Nearly 450 trials involving PSMA in\nPC are registered on clinicaltrials.gov. Nevertheless, all of the current therapies show some degree of toxicity\nand are not curative. We are well-positioned to develop novel therapies through application of our PSMA-\ntargeted theranostic agents. We have recently synthesized PSMA-targeted poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM)\ndendrimers that may be used for PC-specific concurrent delivery of imaging and therapy. PAMAM dendrimers\nserve as versatile delivery vehicles that can be tailored to different sizes and compositions. Here we propose\ndevelopment of multimodal theranostic agents enabling: (I) highly specific PSMA targeting; (II) application of\nquantitative positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) ultimately for selecting patients for\ntherapy; (III) incorporation of a potent antimitotic agent; and, (IV) incorporation of optimized chemical exchange\nsaturation transfer (CEST) moieties to enable non-invasive monitoring of PC drug delivery by the clinically\nubiquitous imaging modality, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As we have shown, CEST is sufficiently\nsensitive to enable targeted imaging. When high-frequency salicylate moieties are used there, is a frequency-\nspecific contrast not encumbered by background signal, allowing determination of targeting efficiency. Direct\nimaging of drug biodistribution provides information needed to understand and improve efficacy. The proposed\nPSMA-targeted theranostic agents will be synthesized via consecutive conjugation of PAMAM dendrimer with\ndeferoxamine (DFO, for radiolabeling with 89Zr, enabling PET/CT and evaluation of pharmacokinetics), lysine-\nurea-glutamate moieties (KEU, for PSMA targeting), and numerous 4-(3-carboxypropanamido)-2-\nhydroxybenzoic acid molecules [salicylic acid (SA) derivatives for CEST contrast]. For therapeutic studies,\nproposed theranostic agents will be additionally equipped with maytansine 1 (DM1) and monomethyl auristatin\ne (MMAE, both routinely used of formulation of antibody-drug conjugates) via either encapsulation or\nconjugation. We will use mice bearing clinically relevant human PC metastatic xenografts for pharmacokinetic\nstudies. Studies will be carried out using state-of-the-art multimodal PET/CT, MRI and optical imaging.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Cognitive decline in the aging brain is driven by overlapping neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathologies. Over 80% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients co-present with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), the vascular deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2). Though CAA and parenchymal A\u03b2 plaques intersect at the levels of A\u03b2 generation and clearance\u2014and share APOE4 as their strongest risk factor\u2014they trigger distinct disease processes: CAA develops insidiously to erode vascular structure and function, induce microbleeds, foment neuroinflammation, and complicate anti-A\u03b2 antibody therapies. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of CAA formation, insult, and clearance in the context of A\u03b2 plaque pathology and APOE genotype is essential to effectively target intertwined neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathways in dementia. Yet, the molecular and cellular processes underlying CAA remain incompletely understood. Single-cell genomics has provided insights into various neurological diseases\u2014but not yet CAA because of a lack of high-quality human tissue at scale and the inability to effectively capture brain vascular cell types. Further, animal models of AD have lacked the ability to precisely control CAA formation for its mechanistic study. To address these challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise spanning vascular neuropathology, clinical imaging, single-cell genomics of the neurovascular unit, AD models, microglia, and APOE biology. We have organized 200 human postmortem brains along CAA progression from ROSMAP with rich demographic, genomic, pathologic, MRI imaging, and longitudinal cognitive data. We will profile these samples with our new brain vascular and immune cell-capturing VINE-seq and spatial genomics approaches. Further, we recently established in mouse models of AD a new paradigm where modulating microglial function is sufficient to control the timing and burden of CAA and microbleeds. We hypothesize that in the healthy aging brain, microglia consolidate soluble A\u03b2 into dense core parenchymal plaques to prevent more damaging vascular A\u03b2\u2014and this process is disrupted by APOE4 and vascular dysfunction. Thus, we expect enhancing or impairing microglial function will modulate the balance of CAA versus parenchymal A\u03b2 plaque burden. With parallel mechanistic studies in mouse models of CAA and molecular analyses of CAA in human tissue, we will elucidate key microglial mechanisms regulating the formation of vascular CAA versus parenchymal A\u03b2 plaques, define single-cell and spatial human brain immunovascular signatures of CAA, and reveal how brain vascular A\u03b2 clearance mechanisms synergize with microglia to clear CAA. With hypothesis-driven functional studies and foundational human molecular datasets of CAA informing one another, our integrated studies will advance fundamental understanding of CAA to inform the development of sensitive blood biomarkers and new approaches to enhance the safety of anti-A\u03b2 immunotherapies.",

The\ngoal of the Consortium is the elimination of cancer as a cause of suffering and death through more effective\nprevention, diagnostics, and treatment, deriving from fundamental insights into the biology of the disease. The\nextensive interdisciplinary collaboration among the partner institutions in the cancer research disciplines of\nbasic, clinical, and public health sciences affords new opportunities to reduce suffering and mortality from\ncancer.\nThe Consortium was established in 2002 to build upon the complementary strengths and resources of three\npartner institutions: the Fred Hutch, which has been an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center since\n1976; the University of Washington, which has significant strength in cancer research, clinical care, and\nteaching; and Seattle Children\u2019s, the major pediatric academic center in the region. In 2008, the Seattle Cancer\nCare Alliance, the cancer treatment center founded and equally co-owned by the three founding institutions,\nwas formally added to the cancer center designation.\nThe Consortium\u2019s total funding base (direct dollars) is $242M, of which $117M is peer-reviewed, including\n$50M from the NCI. During the last grant period, over 170 new faculty members joined the Consortium, adding\nbreadth and depth to our research and clinical capabilities. In the most recent year, we enrolled 1,338 patients\nonto interventional treatment trials, of which more than 50% were investigator-initiated. The ratio of accruals to\nnewly registered patients was 28%.\nThe Consortium serves a catchment area of 13 counties in western Washington. This equates to the region in\nwhich 83 percent of our patients reside. As the only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center in a five-\nstate region (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho), we not only seek to serve the health needs\nof the catchment area through research, training, and outreach, but also to ensure high impact throughout the\nlarger region.\nThe Consortium continues to build upon historic strengths in basic cancer biology, immunology and\ntransplantation, pathogen associated malignancies, tumor specific translational research, computational\nbiology and studies of cancer etiology, prevention, and outcomes. The Consortium is well poised to continue its\nexceptional level of research in these areas.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Cancer predominantly affects the elderly, with a significant incidence of breast cancer in women aged 50-70.\nWhile cell mutations contribute to tumorigenesis, age-related changes in the tumor microenvironment,\nparticularly in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which themselves are diverse subsets with distinct roles,\nincluding inflammatory, vascular, and myofibroblast CAFs (iCAF, vCAF, and myCAF, respectively)2, may play a\ncrucial role. Importantly, CAF subsets display substantial variability between different tissues and even within the\nsame tissue3. Our study identifies senescent CAFs (senCAFs) as key players in breast cancer progression. In\nexciting new data we find that 1) senCAFs are frequently found in DCIS where they predict recurrence and in\ntriple negative breast cancer (TNBC), estrogen receptor positive (ER+) BC, and Her2/Neu+ BC. 2) senCAFs are\nrestricted to the myCAF population, raising the possibility that they are a developmental endpoint and do not\nsimply appear stochastically in response to tissue level stress. 3) Depletion of senCAFs significantly reduces\nprimary tumor progression and metastasis. 4) senCAFs modify the biophysical features of the extracellular matrix\n(ECM), which can impact host immune responses and tumor progression3. 5) senCAFs modify NK cell killing\nactivity, which supports tumor growth. Together, these data lead to our hypothesis that senCAFs alter the\nbiophysical properties of the ECM and immune responses to increase tumor growth and metastasis. To\naddress this exciting hypothesis, we will use state of the art immunological and biophysical techniques in novel\ngenetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) that we have built and human BC specimens in the following\nAims. 1) Determine the organ specific effects of senCAFs on metastatic BC progression; 2) Determine\nhow senCAFs impact ECM dynamics and tumor cell migration; and 3) Determine the impact of senCAFs\non NK cell function and BC tumor progression. Our study on senCAFs, a novel component of the breast\ncancer microenvironment, may uncover critical mechanisms in breast cancer progression, guiding the\ndevelopment of immunotherapeutic and senolytic strategies.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nImaging of macrophage trafficking can reveal important molecular, cellular, and functional characteristics of the\nhost tissue and support the discovery of new biomarkers for improved diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment\nmonitoring. Over the past years, macrophage imaging using different modalities has undergone significant\ndevelopment, however existing modalities offer suboptimal tradeoffs between depth of penetration, specificity,\nsensitivity, and resolution. Although ultrasound (US) could potentially address this challenge, while also providing\nportable assessment (e.g., in an outpatient setting) at potentially lower costs, there is a paucity of investigations\nusing ultrasound for macrophage imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that labelling macrophages\nwith microbubble (MB) ultrasound contrast agents to augment their contrast can enable imaging of macrophage\ntrafficking with high sensitivity deep into tissues without compromising resolution. To test the above hypothesis,\nfirst the detection limit of MB-labeled macrophages under different US imaging pulse sequencies will be\ndetermined (in vitro). After identifying the minimum number of MB-labeled macrophages that can be detected in\nvitro, the sensitivity of imaging MB labeled macrophages with US in healthy mice (in vivo) will be assessed next.\nFinally, as a proof of concept, the ability to monitor macrophage trafficking to diseased organ and to facilitate\ndiagnosis will be assessed in the context of solid tumors (in tumors). If successful, the proposed research will\nprovide a novel framework for macrophage imaging and tracking using ultrasound to support the discovery and\nclinical translation of new US methods and technology for macrophage-based diagnostics and therapy\nmonitoring.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Advancing Next Generation CAR-T cells for Renal Cell Carcinoma",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract\nRenal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) accounts for approximately 90% of kidney cancers in adults. Despite the\nadvancements made in cytokine, immune checkpoint, and targeted therapies, the rate of complete remission is\nlow and nearly all patients with metastatic disease experience disease progression. CAR-T therapy showed\nclinically curative outcomes in hematological malignancies. However, there are multiple roadblocks for CAR-T\nefficacy in solid tumors. Our company and founder have developed novel unbiased large/whole-genome T cell\nCRISPR screening approaches and identified several universal modifications that enhanced CAR-T efficacy\nagainst several tumor models in mice. We have developed a novel unbiased loss-of-function (LOF) screen,\nenabled by site-specific, high-throughput massive knock-in engineering platform. Through this unbiased\nevolution platform, we have identified a key gene PRDM1 mutation (exon 3 deletion) that modifies the epigenetic\nstate of T cells and significantly enhances immune characteristics of CAR-T cells, including increased T cell\nproliferation, reduced exhaustion with improved memory and persistence, and high intra-tumor infiltration. In\naddition, we have exploited the endocytic feature of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4)\ncytoplasmic tail (CT) to reprogram CAR-T function and substantially enhance CAR-T anti-tumor activity in vivo.\nCAR-T cells with CTLA-4 CT fused to the CAR C-terminus exhibit a progressive increase in cytotoxicity under\nrepeated stimulation, accompanied by reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines.\nENPP3 is highly expressed in >90% RCC cases, and expression is highly restricted in normal tissues and\ntypically located apically in normal tissues and thus relatively inaccessible to CAR-T. We have generated and\nscreened multiple scFvs against ENPP3, developed ENPP3 gene-enhanced CAR-Ts, and showed promising in\nvitro and in vivo results in our kidney cancer animal model with no toxicity.\nThe goal of this proposal is to evaluate whether the combination of CAR-CTLA4 tail fusion and PRDM1-exon 3\nknockout (KO) results in superior CAR-T\u2013activity against RCC tumor relative to either modification alone, and to\nnominate the best performing ENPP3 CAR-T plus genetic modification(s) for IND and Phase 1 clinical trials.\nSpecifically, we will evaluate ENPP3 CAR-Ts with PRDM1 \u25b3exon3 alone (CIB-101), CTLA4 tail fusion alone\n(CIB-102), both PRDM1 \u25b3exon3 + CTLA4 tail fusion (CIB-103), and CAR-T with no modifications (CIB-100). We\nwill select our final clinical candidate by performing side-by-side in vitro as well as pre-clinical in vivo evaluation\nof CIB-100 to 103 (aim 1, phase1), followed by process development, GMP manufacturing, pre-clinical\ndevelopment, and IND filing. These studies include efficacy, PK/PD, GLP toxicology, and pathology analysis on\nour final autologous ENPP3 CAR-T clinical candidate (aim 2, phase 2). By the end of the study period, we\nanticipate having selected our final ENPP3 CAR-T and genetic modification(s), performed IND-enabling studies\nand GMP manufacturing, and being ready for the first Phase I clinical trial of our superior lead autologous CAR-\nT products in patients with advanced RCC.\n1",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY:\n Approximately 1.2 million people are currently living with HIV (PLWH) in the United States. These individuals\nare at an elevated risk for various cancers, particularly B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (BCLs), such as diffuse\nlarge B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma. These lymphomas often display comorbidity with Epstein-Barr\nvirus infection (EBV). The use of combinatorial antiretroviral therapy (cART) has been shown to effectively control\nHIV replication, leading to restored immune function and decreased cancer rates in PLWH. Moreover, the latest\ndevelopments in cancer treatment, along with cART, have significantly increased the success rates for PLWH\nbattling cancer. Despite such advancements in treatment and improved survival rates, effectively managing\ncancers in PLWH demands a comprehensive approach \u2013 one that takes into consideration the specific traits of\nthese malignancies when in the presence of HIV.\n HIV and EBV, which solely infect human hosts, create a unique obstacle in the development of in vivo models\nfor assessing potential cancer therapies. Humanized mice with a functional human blood system offer a valuable\nmodel for studying immunotherapeutic approaches for BCLs under HIV and EBV co-infection. Through our\nrecent single-cell transcriptomics analysis of humanized mice, we have discovered that the NSG-SGM3 mouse\noutperforms the standard NSG mouse in its ability to mimic various types of human blood cells found in human\nperipheral blood. Developing a murine model with a realistic human tumor microenvironment largely relies on\nthis critical factor. This model is integral in evaluating the effectiveness of immune-based cancer therapies and\nmonitoring immunological changes throughout treatment. The proposed study aims to confirm the effectiveness\nof new CAR-T cell approaches for treating BCLs in the presence of HIV while examining its immunological impact\nusing a humanized NSG-SGM3 mouse model.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nObesity cultivates complex immune responses in white adipose tissue (WAT), which may contribute to the\ndevelopment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, there still exists a gap in\nknowledge on cellular mechanisms regulating \u201cobesity-specific\u201d immune responses that precludes the\ndevelopment of novel immune therapies to treat obesity and related insulin resistance and T2DM. We were one\nof the first to report T cells in WAT in obesity. Further studies from us and others showed that WAT conventional\nT cells promote, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) protect against, insulin resistance in obesity. Nonetheless, the\nmechanisms underlying WAT Treg homeostasis and mediating their metabolic benefits remain incompletely\nunderstood. This application aims to investigate microRNA-30a (miR-30a) regulation of WAT Tregs and its\nimpacts on WAT immune response and metabolism in obesity. This proposal builds on our novel pilot data: 1)\nmiR-30a expression in WAT correlated positively with insulin sensitivity in obese mice and people; 2) enforced\nmiR-30a expression in WAT promoted whole-body insulin sensitivity in obese mice; 3) miR-30a levels were high\nin WAT Tregs in lean but reduced in obese mice; 4) enforced miR-30a expression in WAT of obese mice\nincreased WAT Treg numbers; 5) specific overexpression of miR-30a in Tregs increased WAT Treg numbers\nand improved insulin sensitivity in mice fed high-fat diet. Therefore, we hypothesize that miR-30a in WAT\nstimulates expansion of WAT Tregs and improves Treg functions to increase insulin sensitivity. We will\ntest this hypothesis by pursuing three aims: Aim 1 will define effects of cell (Treg vs adipocyte)-restricted miR-\n30a on WAT immune response and metabolism in obesity and establish cell-specific roles of miR-30a; Aim 2\nwill build on our additional pilot data that miR-30a delivery in WAT suppresses STAT1 (a key inflammatory\ntranscription factor) and establish how miR-30a targeting of Stat1 governs WAT Treg homeostasis in obesity;\nAim 3 will build on our novel data that compared to diet high in saturated fat, diet high in unsaturated fat induces\nhigher levels of WAT miR-30a and Tregs in mice and examine dietary regulation of miR-30a and its role in WAT\nimmune response and metabolism. We will accomplish these aims using gain-of-function and loss-of-function\napproaches in genetically modified animal models, cutting-edge immunophenotyping and transcriptomics, gold\nstandard clamp for insulin sensitivity, and other state-of-the-art tools. Upon completing these aims, we expect to\nhave uncovered a novel mechanism that may help develop new therapies that leverage the immune system to\ntreat obesity and T2DM.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Metastasis is the major cause of cancer mortality. Effective therapies are urgently needed for patients with\nmetastatic diseases. Increasing evidence suggests that interactions between cancer cells and tumor immune\nmicroenvironment drive metastatic progression. Although prior studies established the vital roles of\nimmunosuppressive TME in metastatic progression, the epigenetic determinant in shaping the metastatic niche\nremains understudied. Absent, small or homeotic 1-like (ASH1L) is a histone lysine methyltransferase that\ninduces methylations at H3K36 and . Although ASH1L was found to drive\nleukemogenesis, little is known about its biological function in solid tumors and metastatic disease. Our\npreliminary studies showed that ASH1L is genetically amplified and overexpressed in metastatic tumors and\ncontributes to metastasis and immunosuppression. The goal of this application is to determine the role and\nmechanisms of action of ASH1L in the metastatic niche. The central hypothesis in this application is that histone\nH3K4 and activates gene transcription\nmethyltransferase ASH1L contributes to the immunosuppressive metastatic niche and is a potential therapeutic\ntarget in metastatic cancers. In the proposed studies, we will 1) determine ASH1L\u2019s role in reshaping the\nmetastatic niche by combining a newly developed genetically engineered mouse model and cutting-edge single-\ncell transcriptomic technologies; 2) elucidate the mechanism by which ASH1L induces immunosuppressive\nmetastatic niche by performing epigenetic profiling, proteomic approaches, and functional studies; 3) determine\nthe anti-metastatic effects of genetically depleting or pharmacologically inhibiting ASH1L in combination with\ncheckpoint immunotherapy in preclinical models, followed by profiling their impact on immune components in\nthe metastatic niche. We expect to identify ASH1L as a key epigenetic determinant in priming\nimmunosuppressive metastatic niche and develop effective targeted therapy and combinatorial immunotherapy\nfor metastatic cancers. These studies are expected to have significant positive impacts, including bridging the\nknowledge gap on the role and mechanisms of action of an understudied epigenetic factor ASH1L in metastatic\ncancers, advancing our understanding of the crosstalk between invading cancer cells and immune components\nin the metastatic niche, and offering implications in regard to the biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and rational\ncombinations for metastatic malignancies.\n1",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "NCI SBIR Phase II Summary\n The immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) block a single immuno-suppressive pathway in cancer patients.\nHowever, across all cancers, less than 30% of patients respond to ICI therapies, due to additional brakes on\nthe immune system, which limit efficacy. The immuno-suppressive cytokine, TGF\u2212\uf062\uf02c is one of those \u201cbrakes\u201d\nthat drives checkpoint resistance in multiple solid tumors such as colorectal, bladder, prostate, head and neck\ncancers and melanoma. Levels of TGF\u2212\uf062 increase as the cancer becomes more aggressive, driving a worse\npatient prognosis. In addition to maintaining tissue health and homeostasis, TGF\u2212\uf062 is a validated tumor\npromoting cytokine with has multiple roles in cancer development, including immune suppression, increasing\nangiogenesis and driving metastasis. Despite long standing interest in TGF\u2212\uf062 blockade as a cancer therapy,\nclinical development has been hampered for two main reasons: 1) significant host (i.e., cardiac) toxicity and 2)\nthe potential to convert indolent early stage tumors into more aggressive ones. However, in preclinical studies,\nblockade of the TGF\u2212\uf062 pathway only in T cells is sufficient for tumor clearance in vivo. Thus, a therapy that\neliminates TGF\u2212\uf062 signaling solely in immune cells would drive tumor clearance, while avoiding the adverse\nevents demonstrated by systemic TGF\u2212\uf062 therapies. With both a Phase I SBIR grant and venture funding, we\nhave generated SYN101, a proprietary immune cell targeted TGF-\uf062 therapeutic (SYN101) that selectively\nreverses TGF-\uf062 mediated immune suppression, while sparing host tissue toxicity. We have demonstrated that\nmonotherapy SYN101 drives tumor clearance and survival in syngeneic mouse tumor models, with\ncorresponding immune cell activation markers in the blood and tumor microenvironment. Moreover, SYN101\ndoes not cause cardiac toxicity at efficacious doses in vivo. In this Phase II SBIR application, we will perform\nadditional in vivo efficacy, safety and PK studies with our SYN101 development candidate, which will lead to\nIND enabling studies. In Aim 1, we will test efficacy of human SYN101 in humanized mouse tumor models,\nalong with corresponding lymphocyte PD markers in the blood and tumor microenvironment. Using CyTOF\nanalysis, we will define the comprehensive immune response driven by SN101 in vivo, as a step towards\nidentifying biomarkers of TGF-\uf062 target engagement in clinical trials. In Aim 2, we will test the safety and toxicity\nof SYN101 in Sprague Dawley rats, the industry standard for systemic TGF-\uf062 inhibitor toxicity. In addition, we\nwill perform PK studies, to round out the full preclinical data package. While we do not anticipate significant\ntoxicity from SYN101, these studies will derisk the platform, establish efficacy and safety, and support entry\ninto IND enabling. Virtually every advanced tumor has elevated TGF\u2212\uf062 levels, such that a safer, more\nefficacious targeted TGF-\uf062 therapy would be beneficial for a significant portion of cancer patients. SYN101 will\nprovide new therapeutic options for refractory cancer patients and will safely reverse immune suppression to\nimprove patient response rates.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Abstract\n Whereas the contribution of tumor microenvironment to the profound immune suppression of\nglioblastoma (GBM) is clear, tumor-cell intrinsic mechanisms that regulate resistance to CD8 T cell mediated\nkilling are less studied. We performed an in vivo CRISPR screen to identify glioma intrinsic kinases that\ncontribute to evasion of tumor cells from CD8 T cell recognition. The screen revealed checkpoint kinase 2\n(Chek2) to be the most important kinase contributing to escape from CD8 T-cell recognition. Genetic depletion\nor pharmacological inhibition of Chek2 with blood-brain-barrier permeable drugs that are in the clinical trials, in\ncombination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, led to survival benefit in preclinical glioma models. Furthermore, our\nexperiment using ex vivo gliomas showed that glioma tumor cell intrinsic Chek2 interacts with Y-Box Binding\nProtein 1 and 3 (YBX1&3). The YBX1&3 are DNA/RNA binding proteins implicated in transcriptional regulation\nof immune-modulatory genes. However, the mechanism underlying the immunosuppressive function of Chek2\nin gliomas is unknown. Therefore, in this proposal, we propose to determine the Chek2-YBX1&3 interaction\nmediated transcriptional changes that modulate CD8 T cell response using chromatin immunoprecipitation\nsequencing and CD8 T cell -mediated tumor cell killing assay (Aim 1). As an independent mechanism, we will\ninvestigate the contribution of Chek2 inhibition/depletion dependent STING pathway activation in enhancing\nCD8 T cell response by inhibiting STING pathway and studying its impact on CD8 T cell proliferation using OT-\n1 CD8 T cell assay (Aim 2). As a potential novel therapeutic approach, we will test if targeting YBX1 enhances\nresponse to PD-1 blockade by determining the effect of this treatment strategy on the survival of preclinical\nglioma models (Aim 3). Together, this project will elucidate the mechanism underlying the immunosuppressive\nfunction of Chek2 and will provide a novel therapeutic strategy combining YBX1 inhibition, Chek2 inhibition and\nPD-1 blockade for testing in GBM patients.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n Despite the tremendous success of the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the persistence of HIV\nreservoirs remains as the major obstacle to achieve HIV cure in infants. Current strategies mainly focus on the\nperipheral reservoirs; however, their efficacy is limited in the central nerve system (CNS) due to its unique\nanatomy. Extensive studies indicate that replication-competent reservoirs persist in the CNS under cART,\ncausing neurological disorders in 15-55% of HIV+ individuals on cART. This issue is particularly concerning for\ninfants, whose brains still grow and develop, leading to numerous neurodevelopment consequences and\nneurologic diseases. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective treatment to suppress CNS infection in\ninfants. One promising strategy is the use of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAb) directed to HIV-1, which\nhave demonstrated potential in both viral suppression and reservoir clearance in animal models and clinical trials.\nHowever, the use of bNAbs for the CNS reservoirs is confounded by poor penetration of the blood brain barrier\n(BBB). Typically, antibody concentrations in the CNS are extremely low, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels at\n~0.1% of those in blood. Our team has developed a novel nanotechnology, which we term nanocapsules, to\nencapsulate bNAb molecules within polymer shells, of which the surface contains abundant choline analogues.\nSuch nanocapsules can effectively deliver bNAbs into the CNS by binding to the choline transporter on the BBB\nupon systemic administration, showing promising results in suppressing the virus in the CNS of non-human\nprimate (NHP) infants.\n Our understanding of CNS infections and associated neuroinflammation during early infection and early\ntreatment is still limited. Recent advances in molecular biology, nucleotide sequencing, and bioinformatics have\nenabled our team to develop methods to track infected cell clones with viral integration sites, revealing the impact\nof therapy on clonally expanded virus-infected cells. We are also exploring the use of a library of barcoded\nviruses for population-level analysis of infection in latent reservoirs and following HIV rebound.\n In this proposed study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of bNAbs in nanocapsules against CNS infections\nand reservoirs, both with and without cART. The success of this study will shed light on the mechanisms\nunderlying CNS infections in infants and demonstrate the effectiveness of bNAbs with improved CNS delivery in\nsuppressing CNS and deep tissue infections and reservoirs. The findings could lead to interventions that can be\ninitiated within the first few weeks of infection, a critical period associated with reduced mortality and slower HIV\nprogression in infants.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract\nLung diseases are a global public health problem with significant morbidity, inadequate therapies and a very\nhigh burden to society. Of these, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is particularly challenging to treat as existing\ntherapeutics, Nintedanib and Pirfenidone, only slow progression but do not reverse fibrosis. One of the reasons\nis in part due to the fact that the vascular endothelium represents a key barrier to effective delivery of anti-fibrotic\ndrugs into lung tissue. Current systemic lung therapies rely on passive transvascular transport to move circulating\ndrugs from the bloodstream and into the target tissue. Hoverer, only minute fractions of the injected doses\nactually reach the lung tissue, diminishing efficacy and often necessitating dose escalation. The ideal goal is to\ndeliver the entire dose of therapeutic into the lung with the minimal exposure of other tissues. We attempt to\napproach this ideal goal by pumping unique immunotherapeutics precisely into lung tissue to comprehensively\nblock activation and differentiation of MF, the key driver of profibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and\nactivation of survival cascades, leading to progressive scarring. The goal of this project is to develop and test\nnovel lung precision drug delivery system (LPDDS) targeting endothelial cells caveolae that are actively and\nspecifically pump myofibroblasts (MF)-directed antifibrotics into lungs at microdoses after intravenous (iv)\ninjection. We have identified the cell surface protein Thy-1 a precision therapeutic and a major modulator of MF\nactivation and differentiation and characterized its role in resolving fibrosis via synergistic engagement of multiple\nprofibrotic signaling pathways. Based on this, we engineered the first \u201cdual precision\u201d bispecific therapeutic\nmAPP:Thy-1 with antibody mediating precise binding/delivery to and penetration of lung tissue via caveolae\ntranscytosis and the other \u2013 mediating Thy-1\u2019s fibrosis-resolving activity in the lung interstitium where the loss of\nThy-1 promotes a dysregulated MF phenotype driving fibrosis. To further potentiate antifibrotic effect, we\ndesigned mAPP:FAP-Nintedanib immunoconjugates, where concerted action of Thy-1 and Nintedanib in the\nlung parenchyma has even greater power to concentrate their fibrosis-resolving activities at the site of action,\npotentially reversing fibrosis. Our goal is to explore transendothelial pumping via caveolae to improve therapy of\nlung diseases at various stages from very early inflammatory to fibrotic. We will optimize lung targeting of our\nLPDDS through engineering and chemistry and will study their specific lung delivery, penetration, accumulation,\nand therapeutic impact using multiple imaging techniques (SPECT-CT, IVM, EM, and IHC). Therapeutic effects\nwill be determined in two rat models that can reproduce many pathological hallmarks of inflammatory and fibrotic\ndisease stages. Our specific aims are 1) to generate and test in vitro activity of caveolae- and myofibroblast-\ntargeting therapeutics, 2) to assess the lung targeting, imaging and tissue processing of caveolae- and\nmyofibroblast-targeting therapeutics in rodent models of fibrosis, and 3) to test the therapeutic efficacy of\ncaveolae/myofibroblast-targeting therapeutics in lung fibrosis. This work sets a foundation for caveolae-targeted\ntherapies and could begin a paradigm shift from passive to active delivery for many pulmonary diseases.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive and lethal form of brain cancer, is characterized by a profound\nimmunosuppressive microenvironment (TME) that restricts the effects of promising immunotherapies. Therefore,\nthere is a pressing need to develop more effective interventions to overcome this mechanism of resistance.\nTumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are a mixture of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and microglia\n(MG), and they are instrumental for the maintenance of the immunosuppressive state of GBM. However, there\nare no effective approaches to overcome the immunosuppressive activity of TAMs in GBM, mainly due to an\nincomplete understanding of TAM regulatory functions. Our long term-goal is to dissect targetable metabolic and\nmolecular mechanisms regulating TAM functions in the context of GBM; as these discoveries will facilitate novel\ntherapies to target immunosuppression and improve the dismaying outcome of GBM patients. A recent study\ndemonstrated that TAM are major consumers of glucose and maintain a robust glucose metabolism in the TME.\nHowever, it has not yet been determined how GBM supports the adaptation to glucose metabolism in TAMs\nand the functional consequences of this adaptation also remain elusive. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress\nactivation is associated with the malignant progression of glioma and with the infiltration of anti-inflammatory\nmacrophages. PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), a critical ER stress sensor, was found to be significantly activated\nin human glioma tissues, and its inhibition altered ATP/lactate production by glioma cells. Our preliminary data\nexpanded these findings indicating that MDM demonstrated highest glucose avidity among MG and neoplastic\ncells in GBM tumors, and PERK was strongly activated in GBM infiltrating GLUT1+MDM. Contrary to MG, MDM\nexhibited potent immunosuppressive activity. GLUT1+MDM were the only contributors to the suppressive activity\nassociated with MDM in GBM tumors. GBM-derived factors primed activation of PERK signaling in MDM, which\ncorrelated with metabolic reprogramming resulting in high glycolysis, immunosuppressive functions, histone\nlactylation, and no change in histone acetylation. Based on our crucial observations, we hypothesize that a\nPERK-driven perturbation of glucose metabolism in MDM governs their immunosuppressive functions via\nlactate-derived lactylation of histone lysine residues. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:\nAim1: to elucidate underlying mechanisms of how PERK governs glycolysis in MDM in GBM tumors; Aim2:\nto define glucose-driven epigenetic modifications that regulates immunosuppressive programs in MDM;\nAim3: to investigate the therapeutic potential of an epigenetic targeting approach to modulate the functions\nof TAMs in GBM. The proposed studies are highly innovative because they will elucidate a previously\nuncharacterized link between ER stress and glucose metabolism that regulates the activity of TAMs via\nepigenetic mechanisms. Our proposal will provide a mechanistic rationale for the development of novel\ntherapies to target immunosuppressive TAMs and enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in GBM patients.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT:\nImmunotherapies produce remarkable, long-term responses in subsets of patients with non-small cell lung\ncancer, but unfortunately, most patients do not respond to such treatment. Current biomarkers to predict which\npatients will benefit have limited accuracy, and decisions to continue or suspend treatment are mainly guided by\nmonitoring of radiographic changes in tumor size. However, unusual immune-related response patterns such\nas pseudo-progression, mixed response, and delayed response can make scans difficult to interpret. Circulating\ntumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a highly promising biomarker for monitoring immunotherapy efficacy.\nSeveral studies involving various immunotherapy agents and multiple types of cancer have demonstrated that\nearly reduction in ctDNA levels during treatment are predictive of tumor response and improved survival\noutcomes. However, existing technologies that measure ctDNA by probing for common somatic mutations will\nfail in patients whose tumors lack these mutations. This limitation is being addressed by creating customized\nassays based on patient-specific tumor mutation profiles; but this approach is complex, expensive, and slow.\nWe have developed a ctDNA assay technology based on detection of epigenetic features that are found in\nvirtually all cancer cell genomes. Our Phase I data indicate that our approach has broad patient coverage and\ncan be applied to multiple types of cancer without requiring tumor profiling and assay customization.

    "AWARD_LONG_TITLE": "Assessment of germline variants associated with immune-related adverse events following immune checkpoint inhibitors",
    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Assessment of germline variants associated with immune-related adverse events following immune checkpoint inhibitors",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment but come with the significant downside\nof immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which can lead to treatment discontinuation, hospitalization, or even\ndeath. Understanding the mechanisms behind irAEs is imperative, not only to minimize toxicity but also because\nirAEs are paradoxically linked to positive anti-tumor responses, while their aggressive management correlates\nwith increased relapse risk.\nOur research posits that gaining a nuanced understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying irAEs could\nenable clinicians to differentiate between clinical benefits and harmful side effects, thus optimizing\nimmunotherapy efficacy. We have previously shown that germline variants are associated with irAEs, and have\nalso noted that somatic alterations impact immunotherapy efficacy by interacting with the immune environment.\nShort-term Objectives:\nAim 1: We plan to conduct the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) for irAEs, covering over 13,000\nICI patients, using novel imputation and survival models. This will include aggregating pan-cancer data across\nmultiple cohorts. We aim to characterize shared and distinct genetic architectures of irAE subtypes and evaluate\nhow germline variants interact with therapy agents to influence safety and efficacy outcomes. We will aggregate\ngermline data for 13,000 patients to conduct a GWAS for irAEs and clinically annotate and aggregate pan-cancer\ndata. Sub-population GWAS will identify subtype/organ-specific germline associations. Longitudinal competing\nevent models will be used to assess the mechanistic effects of each variant on safety and efficacy outcomes.\nAim 2: We will delve into the cell-type-specific mechanisms, tumor microenvironment interactions, and ancestral\nvariability of germline irAE variants. Bulk and single-cell RNA-seq (sc-RNA-seq) data will be integrated to\nelucidate these mechanisms, and somatic alteration interactions will also be analyzed. RNA-seq and tumor/blood\nscRNA-seq will be utilized to identify cell-type-specific mechanisms and interactions of germline variants with\nsomatic drivers.\nLong-term Objectives: Our long-term goal is to personalize immunotherapy by tailoring it to individual genetic\nmakeup, thus minimizing irAEs and optimizing efficacy. This could dramatically improve cancer treatment\noutcomes and reduce healthcare burdens associated with complications, contributing to public health. By\ndissecting the genetic landscape and its interaction with immunological and somatic factors, our work aims to\npave the way for safer and more effective cancer immunotherapies.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG) is an inoperable pediatric brain tumor with no good treatment options.\nOur group has developed a novel treatment modality for this disease and others, using mRNA vaccines\nconsisting of tumor derived antigens packed into a unique lipid nanoparticle (NP). They can provide near\nimmediate immune induction against inciting malignancies. RNA-NPs can thus be harnessed as an\neffective therapy for patients with DIPG and other refractory malignancies. In addition, DIPG has a\nhighly conserved H3K27M mutation that serves as an excellent target for these therapies.\nBased on the above, we propose exploring the immunogenicity of RNA-NPs targeting the DIPG\nH3K27M mutation, as well as the feasibility, safety, and anti-tumor activity of tumor loaded RNA-NP\nvaccines in animal models. These RNA NPs have shown survival benefit in our preclinical murine model\nof DMG. Among these animals with significant survival benefit, there is development of hydrocephalus,\nwhich is thought to be secondary to increased lesion size secondary to an immunotherapeutic response\nduring treatment. In our clinical trials investigating RNA NPs as a treatment for canine glioma in adult\ndogs, we saw a similar effect in MRI imaging of animals that became long-term survivors. Following\ndetailed analysis of these lesions in mouse, canine and human patients during RNA-NP therapy, there\nappears to be features of both reactive gliosis and traditional pseudoprogression (immune infiltration),\nsuggesting a new radiographic diagnosis I have named paraprogression. I hypothesize that\nparaprogression is a novel radiographic entity characterized by reactive gliosis and increased lesion size\nin therapeutic responders. In this study, I aim to visualize paraprogression using advanced MRI\ntechniques, elucidate the mechanism behind the increase in lesion size, and combat this effect without\ncompromising our promising survival benefit conferred by RNA NP vaccine in our preclinical DMG\nmodel.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Our objective is develop and rigorously validate a transformative technology that integrates cellular\nfunctions/activities with their deep molecular signatures at single-cell resolution, in high-throughput.\nImmunotherapy has emerged as a highly effective approach for the treatment of human cancer, and works by\nharnessing the power of the immune system and its ability to recognize and eliminate cancer cells.\nImmunotherapy has distinct advantages, including: (i) sustained and durable responses; (ii) defined mechanisms\nof action; and (iii) higher specificity and fewer-off target effects than traditional approaches. Along with antibody\nimmunotherapy, genetically engineering T cells for redirecting immune responses has recently received Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT), based on infusing in vitro expanded T\ncells bearing either T-cell receptors (TCR), or chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), have demonstrated dramatic\nand durable responses, even in heavily pretreated patients. Despite these initial clinical successes, patient\nresponses vary widely. Recent correlative data indicate that variability in the manufactured T cell products may\nbe the primary determinant of clinical success. Since cellular infusion products are a heterogeneous mixture of\ncells, mapping the complexity of the population requires the ability to identify the function and molecular profiles\nof cells at single-cell resolution. There is an essential need for technologies that are able to map this complexity\nin T-cell functionality and being able to link function to molecular profiles at single-cell resolution. We propose\nthe development and validation of Multiscale Intelligent Convergence (MusIC). MusIC will provide multi-scale\ndata from molecules to subcellular dynamics to cell-cell interaction biology on the same cells across thousands\nof cells. Given the heterogeneity in the composition of cells being used for ACT, it serves as the ideal system for\nthe development and validation of MusIC. Our team of investigators has expertise in single-cell technology\ndevelopment and immunotherapy, machine learning, and image analysis and data modeling. We anticipate that\nthe successful implementation of this proposal will enable the validation of MusIC as a platform for studying\nmulti-scale cell biology. This in turn, will lead to the more reliable biomanufacturing of T-cell infusion products,\nand the engineering of more potent immune cells can have a broad impact on immunotherapy.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract\nThis proposal outlines the five-year research and career development plans for the PI, Stephen P. Persaud,\nMD, PhD, who is preparing for a career as an academic physician-scientist. Dr. Persaud completed his MD\nand PhD in immunology in 2015 at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM), then completed his\nresidency in Clinical Pathology in 2018 at Barnes-Jewish Hospital as part of the Pathology Physician Scientist\nTraining Program. During his residency elective time, he began postdoctoral research in the lab of John\nDiPersio, MD, PhD, in the Oncology Division of the Department of Medicine at WUSM. Dr. DiPersio is an\nexpert in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), normal and malignant hematopoiesis,\nand cellular immunotherapy, and has an outstanding track record of training successful physician-scientists.\nThe exemplary scientific resources and environment provided by the DiPersio lab and WUSM, combined with\nthe mentoring and training plans described herein, will enhance Dr. Persaud\u2019s research program and advance\nhis progress towards becoming an independent investigator. The long-term goal of the proposed research\nis to optimize HSCT conditioning, stem cell mobilization, and therapeutic gene editing to safely enable\ntransplantation for non-malignant hematologic diseases, particularly sickle cell disease (SCD). Dr.\nPersaud published the first study showing that CD45- or cKit-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)\ncombined with Janus kinase 1/2 (JAK1/2) inhibitors could enable fully MHC-mismatched HSCT in mice. This\nwork was the DiPersio lab\u2019s first contribution to the antibody-based conditioning field and gave rise to several\nsuccessful projects, including 1) development of fully myeloablative ADCs suitable for HSCT conditioning in the\ncontext of leukemia therapy, 2) the combination of anti-CD47/cKit antibodies with JAK1/2 inhibitors for toxin-\nfree allo-HSCT conditioning, and 3) development of a novel streptavidin-based platform for rapid ADC\nproduction and screening. Dr. Persaud will build on this body of work in this proposal via two Specific Aims,\nwhich focus on overcoming the major hurdles to autologous gene therapy for SCD. In Aim 1, he will evaluate\nnovel stem cell mobilization regimens combining VLA-4 and CXCR4 inhibition and assess their ability to\ngenerate a sufficient quantity and quality of stem cells for autologous gene therapy compared to standard-of-\ncare regimens. In Aim 2, Dr. Persaud will optimize toxin-free conditioning with anti-CD47/cKit antibodies for\ntransplantation and cure of SCD, including the development of novel bispecific CD47 x cKit antibodies.\nCollectively, these studies will explore the basic biology and translational potential of several novel approaches\nfor improving the safety and efficacy of HSCT. Although this proposal focuses on autologous gene therapy for\nSCD, the work has important implications for both autologous and allogeneic transplantation for malignant and\nnon-malignant diseases alike. Finally, the research will advance Dr. Persaud\u2019s primary goal of building a\nresearch program dedicated to maximizing the therapeutic benefit of HSCT while minimizing injury to the host.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Targeting breast cancer microenvironment with small molecule agonist of relaxin receptor",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "The therapeutics efficacy of an anticancer treatment is often restricted by tumor fibrous tissue and tumor\nmicroenvironment. Stromal matrix barriers create a sanctuary for breast cancer, while the prolonged pro-fibrotic\nstimuli facilitate cancer cell growth and survival by establishing an immunosuppressive environment. Relaxin, a\nsmall peptide hormone, demonstrated dual anti-fibrotic and pro-immunogenic effects in various disease models\nincluding several solid cancers. Treatment with relaxin significantly reduced the expression of major tumor\nextracellular matrix components such as collagens, fibronectin, and elastin. The degradation of fibrotic tumor\nmatrix following relaxin treatment led to reduced cancer cell drug resistance. Additionally, it was shown that\nrelaxin can change tumor macrophage population from pro-inflammatory to pro-resolution enabling T cell-\nmediated cancer cell killing and macrophage phagocytosis. However, due to a short half-life in vivo, delivery of\nrecombinant relaxin requires continuous infusion. Relaxin signals through its cognate G protein-coupled receptor\nRXFP1, which is expressed in tumor associated fibroblasts and infiltrating immune cells. We propose targeting\nthe integrity of the tumor microenvironment with the first-in-class small molecule agonist of RXFP1 developed in\nour laboratories. The lead compound, ML290, shows high activity, oral bioavailability, in vivo stability, and\nexcellent pharmacological properties. It is well tolerated by animals, shows no toxicity in vivo, and does not\nincrease cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness nor does it affect extracellular matrix remodeling in healthy\ntissues. Our preliminary data indicate that the ML290 treatment of mice with HER2-positive breast cancer\nreduces tumor size and tumor fibrotic content. The overall goal of this project is to demonstrate anticancer activity\nof relaxin receptor agonist, ML290, in preclinical models of breast cancer, regardless of cancer subtype. We will\ntest the anti-cancer efficacy of ML290 in primary and metastatic breast cancer models, analyze changes in tumor\nECM composition, recruitment of immune cells, and genomic/proteomic response in stromal and cancer cells to\ntreatment. We will analyze the effect of combination treatment of ML290 with immune checkpoint blockade and\nanti-HER2 immunotherapeutics. The pharmacological re-programing of stromal cancer microenvironment by\nML290 will provide a new therapeutic approach for breast cancer suppression.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "A Dose Expansion Study of SX-682 Alone and in Combination with Decitabine in MDS Patients",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are genetically and morphologically diverse hematopoietic neoplasms that\narise from a small pool of mutant clones within hematopoietic stem and progenitor compartments [1-9]. MDS is\na pre-leukemic syndrome to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Only four drugs have received regulatory approval\nfor MDS, with the two hypomethylating agents (HMAs) azacitidine and decitabine (iv and oral with cedazuridine)\neach with suboptimal response rates (~15-20% for CR+PR) and of limited durability, typically 1-2 years [10].\nOnce these agents fail, there is no second-line treatment. Prognosis after failure is dismal, with median survival\nat <6 months for higher-risk patients, and <18 months for lower-risk patients [11]. That MDS is frequently\ncharacterized by relapse or failure to achieve durable remission, indicates that current treatments do not\nadequately eradicate the disease-initiating stem cells. Clearly there is a significant unmet need for a new MDS\ntreatment in the frontline and HMA-relapsed/refractory (HMA-RR) settings that eradicates leukemic stem cells\nand normalizes cytopenias. Chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 (CXCR1/2) and its ligands (CXCL 1, 2,\n3, 5, 7 and CXCL8) are elevated in the bone marrow and plasma of patients with AML and MDS where they\ndrive mutant stem cell growth and correlate with reduced survival [12-16], transfusion dependence [17] and HMA\nresistance [14]. CXCR1/2 on MDSCs are pivotal in their recruitment to the bone marrow where they kill\nhematopoietic progenitors and impair anti-leukemic immune surveillance [18-20]. Dual CXCR1/2 blockade is\ntherefore a preclinically validated multi-prong strategy to attack (1) mutant stem cells, (2) the immunosuppressive\nmarrow microenvironment and (3) hematopoiesis-killing MDSCs, and (4) are implicated in de novo and acquired\nHMA-resistance. SX-682 is a clinical-stage, small-molecule CXCR1/2 inhibitor that is in multiple trials in which\nit exhibits activity in metastatic melanoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and as a single-agent in HMA-\nRR MDS (NCT04245397), where it arrests unrestrained outgrowth of stem and progenitor compartments and\nalters the mutant stem and progenitor architecture and inflammatory niche. The specific aims of this proposal\nencompass adding additional cohorts to our ongoing MDS trial that will test SX-682 alone and together with oral\nor intravenous decitabine in the frontline and HMA-RR settings and the preparation of SX-682 study drug to\nsupport clinical evaluation. Our hypothesis is that de novo or acquired resistance to HMA involves the CXCR1/2\naxis, and that adding SX-682 to decitabine will provide efficacy better than either agent alone. The primary\nobjective is to show preliminary clinical evidence of improved outcomes in patients treated with SX-682 and\ndecitabine compared to historical data for either agent alone. If successful, SX-682 added to decitabine would\ntransform the MDS treatment landscape.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary / Abstract\nGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive and malignant brain tumor with no known cure. GBM is\nprojected to account for almost 14,500 new cases and approximately 10,000 deaths in the United States (U.S.)\nin 2023. The prognosis for patients afflicted with GBM is incredibly poor, with a median survival of\napproximately 8 months and less than 5% of patients surviving 5 years.\nAlthough therapies for GBM exist, these poor outcomes are a direct testament to the treatment challenges.\nThe difficulty in treating GBM is due to several factors. 1) Treatments must cross the blood brain barrier (BBB)\n- this constrains the molecular properties of prospective drug candidates. 2) Treatments must be agnostic to\ncell type so GBM cells are preferentially targeted over healthy cells. 3) GBM tumors often contain a population\nof glioma stem cells which are highly resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. 4) The immunoinhibitory tumor\nmicroenvironment of GBM renders traditional immunotherapy approaches ineffective.\nDue to these challenges GBM treatment has remained largely unchanged for almost 20 years; the current\nstandard of care is surgical resection followed by radiation and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. The\naddition of TMZ to this therapeutic strategy only extended patient survival for a few months yet it is still in use\ntoday since further developments have yet to show more dramatic survival improvements.\nThe most promising new treatment for GBM is a specialized form of immunotherapy that utilizes oncolytic\nviruses (OVs). When the correct virus is chosen it can overcome the obstacles inhibiting other treatment\napproaches. Neurotropic viruses are able to effectively cross the BBB, and the correct virus can specifically\nand preferentially target GBM cells while avoiding killing healthy cells. Additionally, 50% of tumors are resistant\nto TMZ treatment, but OVs remain effective in these tumors. The data suggests OVs can even overcome and\nreverse immunosuppressive microenvironments in the tumors.\nWe have identified two strains of Zika virus (ZIKV) that demonstrate substantial oncolytic activity and the\npotential for safe administration to humans. Our testing shows that these strains preferentially infect GBM cells,\nand they effectively and dramatically reduce GBM tumors in a mouse model. We have data suggesting these\nstrains have a strong safety profile as well. We are incredibly enthusiastic about the therapeutic potential these\nstrains offer. This proposal is designed specifically to complete IND-enabling experiments in order to move this\nnovel treatment into the clinic.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nThe goal of this project is to develop a novel synthetic biology-based cellular medicine that leverages natural\nmicrobiome pathways to inhibit gut inflammatory processes for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease\n(IBD). Over 3 million adults in the U.S. suffer from IBD, an umbrella term encompassing two chronic\ninflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract: Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)1. IBD is\ntypically diagnosed in the second or third decades of life, is life-long, and there is no cure. Current IBD\ntreatments can have serious side-effects, and patients become refractory. Novel therapies that are safe and\neffective, particularly restoring the intestinal membrane barrier, are needed and would be life changing.\nIntestinal immune regulatory signals tightly govern healthy gut homeostasis, and their breakdown may result in\nIBD40. The human microbiome, harboring trillions of bacteria, is a critical regulator of these mechanisms.\nCommensal bacteria function to maintain intestinal epithelial barrier integrity and regulate innate and adaptive\nimmune cell function41. Surface layer proteins (Slps), including SlpA, SlpB, SlpX, and lipoteichoic acid (LTA)\ninteract with pattern recognition receptors (PRR) expressed on innate immune intestinal cells to fine immunity\nin steady state and diseased conditions42-45. Our research team demonstrated that SlpA is the predominant\nanti-inflammatory Slp signal. SlpA binds to the C-type lectin Specific Intracellular adhesion molecule-3\nGrabbing Non-integrin homolog-Related 3 (SIGNR3) receptor expressed on dendritic cells lining the gut\nprevents experimentally induced colitis in multiple models15. Oral delivery of SlpA via L. lactis (also known as\nR-3750 or R110) reduced inflammatory cytokines, strengthened the mucosal membrane barrier, and supported\na healthier microbiota make-up in animal models of gut inflammation20. Notably, the effects and protection\nmediated by SlpA were not observed in Signr3-/- mice, suggesting that SlpA interaction with SIGNR3 plays a\nkey protective role in regulating the disease condition15. New data from our Phase 1 clinical trial in patients\nsuffering from ulcerative colitis (NCT05666960) showed that R-3750 was safe and yielded promising biomarker\ndata and clinical outcome results demonstrating clinical proof-of-concept.\nOur goal is to develop R-3750, a synthetic biology engineered SlpA-expressing Lactococcus (L.) lactis strain,\nas a novel, orally administered drug that functions as immune therapy to reduce gut inflammation, improve\ngastrointestinal mucosal barrier function, and restore the natural microbiome make-up in IBD patients. This\nCRP application is intended to build upon our prior product development success and advance R-3750 into\nPhase 2 clinical testing. The specific aims are: 1) establish 250L scale GMP manufacturing infrastructure, 2)\ndevelop 250L scale process for R-3750 clinical manufacturing, 3) perform clinical GMP manufacturing of R-\n3750 Drug Substance, 4) prepare Drug Product for distribution to clinical sites, and 5) obtain FDA regulatory\napproval to start a Phase 2 clinical trial.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT\nLung cancer is the most lethal cancer and is responsible for 1.8 million deaths worldwide. Blacks are 15% less\nlikely to be diagnosed early, 10% more likely to not receive any treatment, and 12% less likely to survive 5\nyears compared to Whites. Overwhelmingly, there is enough proof that cancer treatments such as platinum-\nbased chemotherapy drugs, immunotherapy drugs, hormone treatment, anti-inflammatory drugs, combination\ntreatment, and anti-cancer agents, are effective in prolonging survival. In addition, delays, early termination of\ntreatments and early termination of treatment cycles occur among the elderly and increase mortality.\nFurthermore, there may be important causal factors in relation to patient and provider characteristics that may\ninfluence treatment success. However, we do not know how well it generalizes in terms of risks for survival to\nBlack non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, a population with higher rates of lung cancer-specific and\nall-cause mortality compared to Whites. Our long-term goal is to study the disparities in inequitable cancer\ntreatments and survival by educating clinicians. Our short-term goal is to document and communicate racial\ninequities discovered to clinicians. Our main objective is to determine whether Black NSCLC patients are\nreceiving comparable cancer treatment to White NSCLC patients that can lengthen their survival. Our central\nhypothesis is that there are racial disparities in receiving cancer treatment and treatment combinations, such\nas chemotherapy plus immunotherapy that may improve survival. We will use the National Comprehensive\nCancer Network oncologic guidelines for NSCLC to determine standard treatment. To address our specific\naims, we will use a retrospective cohort study design and analyze our data using logistic and survival mixed\nmodels. Our specific aims are to: 1) Determine racial disparities for receipt of cancer treatments, time to\nreceiving first single cancer treatment/treatment combinations, number of cycles and dose given in NSCLC; 2)\nDetermine the impact of time on lung-specific survival and overall survival; and 3) Investigate the bidirectional\nintersectionality of causal factors in receiving treatment, delays in receiving first treatment, number of cycles,\nand dose that impact racial disparities by stage, including patient characteristics (toxicities from cancer\ntreatments, histology, symptom burden, comorbidities, age, sex, insurance, SES levels, urban/rural area) and\nprovider characteristics (type of facility, hospital ownership, teaching status, location, and number of hospital\nbeds). Future studies will be aimed at investigating these Specific Aims in other minority groups, other types of\ncancers for which Blacks have decreased survival, and translating the qualitative aspects of treatment\nmanagement in NSCLC patients.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\n Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is characterized by progressive loss of synapses and neurons along with\namyloid and Tau pathologies. Although amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2)-reducing immunotherapy received full approval by the\nFDA for patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild AD, developing future treatments against AD at all\nstages is an urgent priority. One of our recent 12 publications described our cohorts of patients with MCI, mild,\nmoderate, or severe AD within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System. Using electronic\nhealth records (EHRs), we reported a slower progression to AD among veterans on prescribed vasodilators,\nincluding anti-hypertensive angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers\n(ARBs). We compared a spectrum of anti-hypertension, anti-diabetic or anti-hypercholesterolemia medications\nand reported a reduced risk of AD onset among vasodilator users (e.g., Valsartan, Carvedilol, Losartan) and an\nincreased risk of AD onset among vasoconstrictor users (e.g., Propranolol). We also reported that ACEIs reduced\nphosphorylated Tau (pTau) in mouse brains. We further reported that Fasudil, a specific vasodilator and a Rho-\nassociated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) 1/2 inhibitor, decreased pTau in human neuro-spheroids. We therefore\npropose to perform data mining of 25 million veterans\u2019 76 billion medical records from the VA Corporate Data\nWarehouse and to test the clinical effectiveness of more potent vasodilators, such as a selective ROCK2 inhibitor\nBelumosudil, in delaying AD onset among veterans. We will also test if Belumosudil suppresses\nneurodegeneration in AD mouse models. Our access to VA EHR as well as our expertise in development and\nmultidisciplinary analysis of Familial AD mouse models place us in a unique position to test the hypothesis that\nvasodilation alleviates cognitive impairment in AD patients as well as memory deficits and neurodegeneration in\nAD mouse models. In this competing continuation application, we propose to evaluate the effects of more potent\nvasodilators on cognitive impairment of AD patients and AD mouse models (Aim 1). We will perform big data\nanalysis of EHR to collect vasodilators that are associated with delayed onset of AD, compared to the benchmark\nARB drug Valsartan. We will also test whether vasodilators, such as Belumosudil, alleviate neurodegeneration\nand memory impairment in AD mouse models. We will also explore molecular mechanisms of vasodilators using\nsingle nucleus RNAseq and proteomic analyses of AD postmortem brains and mouse models (Aim 2). The\nsignificant impact of the current study is that these small molecules derived from big data mining and validated\nin AD mouse models may be fast-tracked to next generation safe therapies of AD.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nPlease see the Volume 1. Technical Proposal.\n\n1. Background and Purpose\nThe Women\u2019s Health Research Initiative (WHRI) recognizes that women have historically been \nunderrepresented in biomedical research, and as a result, there is a lack of understanding of sex \nand gender-related differences in risk factors and health outcomes. The Initiative rightly \nemphasizes a need for the application of novel analytical approaches to rich datasets to elucidate \nthese differences, improve our understanding of Women\u2019s Health issues, and inform more effective \nmedical interventions.\nInitiated in 2014, the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program is part of the \nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\u2019s (NHLBI\u2019s) broader precision medicine initiative which \naims to improve the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) disorders \nthrough tailored and individualized disease treatments. The TOPMed program generates whole \ngenome sequencing (WGS) and other \u2013omics data and integrates them with molecular, behavioral, \nimaging, environmental, and clinical data to better understand the biological processes that \nunderlie HLBS disorders. Petabytes of \u2013omics, phenotypic and environmental exposure data \ngenerated by TOPMed from approximately 200,000 research subjects across 90+ studies are fed \ninto NHLBI\u2019s BioData Catalyst (BDC) ecosystem and the Database for Genotypes and Phenotypes \n(dbGaP) for use by scientific investigators.\nData collected as part of the TOPMed Program have significant potential to improve women\u2019s \nhealth outcomes, however, due to the complexity and multi-factorial nature of the data, novel \nmethods are needed to discover and measure \u2013omics-level sex differences. Recent advances in \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods have shown significant promise to \nuncover previously unknown statistical associations across a range of therapeutic areas, \nparticularly when combining different types of data, such as whole genome sequences, clinical \nmeasures, and medical imaging. By bringing together TOPMed data, experienced AI and ML \nresearchers, and subject matter experts in Women\u2019s Health, with the analytical infrastructure \nprovided by the BDC, we will be able to address the long-standing sex-related disparities in \nbiomedical research. \nThe NHLBI is establishing the Artificial Intelligence \u2013 \nCoordinating Center (AI-CC) to serve as a central hub for \ncoordinating research projects and bringing together AI \nand scientific experts to collaborate on innovative \napproaches to analyze and interpret TOPMed data. \nAdditionally, the AI-CC may support other areas of \nNHLBI\u2019s research interest such as the use of AI on \nimaging and \u2013omics data in the areas of radiomics and \nradiogenomics to advance the understanding of chronic \nlung disease, especially idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\nWestat is well-positioned to implement and operate the \nAI-CC due to the significant efficiencies that will be \ngained from our role as the TOPMed Administrative \nCoordinating Center (ACC). Our experience and \ncapabilities include: (1) a strong team of staff that \nroutinely collaborates with NHLBI, TOPMed investigators, and the BDC team; (2) established and \neffective processes, procedures, and systems that can easily and quickly be adapted and applied to \nthe AI-CC; (3) familiarity with TOPMed data and associated analyses; (4) substantial experience \nand established processes for managing sub-Other Transaction Authority (OTA) awards; and \n(5) experience in AI and ML methods. Where feasible, to maximize synergy and to gain most \nefficiencies, we have selected the staff that currently support TOPMed, augmented with other \nrelevant experts. Our approach will not only leverage the efficiencies afforded by the TOPMed \nprogram, but also provide an efficient and scalable mechanism to support additional research \nareas, beginning with a focus on lung disease.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\n Electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities in Alzheimer\u2019s disease are poorly understood and can\nprovide insight into network changes accompanying disease progression and serve as non-invasive\nbiomarkers. This proposal is based on a novel EEG abnormality that is common very early in life in mouse\nmodels of Alzheimer\u2019s disease neuropathology. The abnormality consists of high frequency oscillations\n(HFOs), ultrafast (>250 Hz), and very brief (~30 ms) electrical events in the EEG. Notably, HFOs are known to\noccur in epilepsy but their role in Alzheimer\u2019s disease models remains unknown.\n The goals of the proposed project are: (i) to determine the role of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) as a\nnew type of abnormal Alzheimer\u2019s disease-related electrical biomarker using electrode arrays, (ii) to\nmanipulate HFOs in real time as a method to boost or repress memory, since impaired memory is a major\nsymptom of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and last (iii) to test an underlying mechanism contributing to HFOs in\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease.\n In Aim 1 we will address the novel hypothesis that HFOs start as a local phenomenon in the hippocampus\nand progressively expand into more superficial areas as the mice get older. To this end, we will take advantage\nof a novel neurotechnology that uses flexible electrode arrays and a mouse model of cerebral amyloid\noverexpression that shows robust HFOs to record longitudinally. We will also test if HFOs precede other\nepileptiform abnormalities and reduced gamma power, which are commonly seen in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nThese experiments will tell us if HFOs can be considered an early biomarker. Furthermore, we will ask whether\nand how HFOs relate to the other abnormalities.\n In Aim 2 we will address the role of HFOs in impaired memory and test an underlying mechanism. We will\nuse a novel closed-loop protocol we developed to detect and disrupt HFOs in real time to test whether\nselective disruption of HFOs during sleep is beneficial to memory and Alzheimer\u2019s disease neuropathology.\nImportantly, our preliminary data suggest that the closed-loop approach improves memory in a mouse model of\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease. To address mechanism, we will test a gene therapy approach to reduce HFOs in vivo by\noverexpressing a specific K+ channel and test if memory is improved. Notably, our pilot data suggest that\noverexpression of this K+ channel reduces HFOs in vivo. Effects of the closed-loop approach or K+ channel\noverexpression will be tested on HFOs and other epileptiform activity. Because HFOs occur during a sleep\nstage where A\u03b2 is being cleared, we will also stain for soluble A\u03b2 and ask if it is reduced when HFOs are\ndisrupted.\n This project will address an unmet goal for new and improved biomarkers and two novel strategies to\ndisrupt them using state-of-the-art methods. It also aims to provide a solid foundation for future investigation of\nHFOs in diverse models to address mechanisms and circuits that HFOs utilize in Alzheimer\u2019s disease\npathophysiology. Lastly, we expect the findings and protocols developed in this project to be relevant for a\nrange of brain disorders affecting memory including epilepsy.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nAD disproportionately affects women and people of color. With no cure for AD, it becomes important to identify\nsex-specific modifiable risk factors at midlife, especially those that affect minority women. For women who reach\nmidlife, the menopause is a universal transition often accompanied by adverse symptoms that may affect their\nlater health. Sleep disturbance and vasomotor symptoms (VMS; hot flashes) are among the most common and\nbothersome menopausal symptoms and have been associated with AD biomarkers and adverse brain and\ncognitive outcomes, particularly verbal memory. Black and Hispanic women typically experience more severe\nand persistent VMS, experience more sleep disturbance, and show more persistent memory declines across the\nmenopause transition compared to White women. Black women also exhibit weaker rest-wake activity rhythms\n(RAR), which are associated with worse cognitive performance. Considering the increased burden of VMS, sleep\ndisturbance, and weakened RAR in black women, these modifiable symptoms may contribute to their more\npersistent menopause-related declines in memory and potentially to the greater burden of AD experienced by\nblack women. The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that VMS, sleep disturbance, and RAR\ncontribute to worse memory performance in black midlife women and to understand the relative contribution of\neach to memory dysfunction. Building on preliminary data from 20 women recruited to date, 70 black and/or\nHispanic peri- and postmenopausal women with moderate to severe VMS will undergo assessment with\nwearable devices (VMS monitor and actigraphy watch) to objectively measure VMS, sleep disturbance and RAR\nduring three consecutive days/nights. Memory will be assessed with a test of verbal memory as well as pattern\nseparation, a test that yields behavioral indices that align with the function of specific hippocampal subregions.\nThis innovative study is the study to examine objectively measured menopause symptoms in relation to cognition\nin black and Hispanic women with moderate to severe VMS. The study will yield new insights into modifiable risk\nfactors for memory declines in this understudied group.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nPlease see the Volume 1. Technical Proposal.\n\n1. Background and Purpose\nThe Women\u2019s Health Research Initiative (WHRI) recognizes that women have historically been \nunderrepresented in biomedical research, and as a result, there is a lack of understanding of sex \nand gender-related differences in risk factors and health outcomes. The Initiative rightly \nemphasizes a need for the application of novel analytical approaches to rich datasets to elucidate \nthese differences, improve our understanding of Women\u2019s Health issues, and inform more effective \nmedical interventions.\nInitiated in 2014, the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program is part of the \nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\u2019s (NHLBI\u2019s) broader precision medicine initiative which \naims to improve the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) disorders \nthrough tailored and individualized disease treatments. The TOPMed program generates whole \ngenome sequencing (WGS) and other \u2013omics data and integrates them with molecular, behavioral, \nimaging, environmental, and clinical data to better understand the biological processes that \nunderlie HLBS disorders. Petabytes of \u2013omics, phenotypic and environmental exposure data \ngenerated by TOPMed from approximately 200,000 research subjects across 90+ studies are fed \ninto NHLBI\u2019s BioData Catalyst (BDC) ecosystem and the Database for Genotypes and Phenotypes \n(dbGaP) for use by scientific investigators.\nData collected as part of the TOPMed Program have significant potential to improve women\u2019s \nhealth outcomes, however, due to the complexity and multi-factorial nature of the data, novel \nmethods are needed to discover and measure \u2013omics-level sex differences. Recent advances in \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods have shown significant promise to \nuncover previously unknown statistical associations across a range of therapeutic areas, \nparticularly when combining different types of data, such as whole genome sequences, clinical \nmeasures, and medical imaging. By bringing together TOPMed data, experienced AI and ML \nresearchers, and subject matter experts in Women\u2019s Health, with the analytical infrastructure \nprovided by the BDC, we will be able to address the long-standing sex-related disparities in \nbiomedical research. \nThe NHLBI is establishing the Artificial Intelligence \u2013 \nCoordinating Center (AI-CC) to serve as a central hub for \ncoordinating research projects and bringing together AI \nand scientific experts to collaborate on innovative \napproaches to analyze and interpret TOPMed data. \nAdditionally, the AI-CC may support other areas of \nNHLBI\u2019s research interest such as the use of AI on \nimaging and \u2013omics data in the areas of radiomics and \nradiogenomics to advance the understanding of chronic \nlung disease, especially idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\nWestat is well-positioned to implement and operate the \nAI-CC due to the significant efficiencies that will be \ngained from our role as the TOPMed Administrative \nCoordinating Center (ACC). Our experience and \ncapabilities include: (1) a strong team of staff that \nroutinely collaborates with NHLBI, TOPMed investigators, and the BDC team; (2) established and \neffective processes, procedures, and systems that can easily and quickly be adapted and applied to \nthe AI-CC; (3) familiarity with TOPMed data and associated analyses; (4) substantial experience \nand established processes for managing sub-Other Transaction Authority (OTA) awards; and \n(5) experience in AI and ML methods. Where feasible, to maximize synergy and to gain most \nefficiencies, we have selected the staff that currently support TOPMed, augmented with other \nrelevant experts. Our approach will not only leverage the efficiencies afforded by the TOPMed \nprogram, but also provide an efficient and scalable mechanism to support additional research \nareas, beginning with a focus on lung disease.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Mapping Synaptic Density in Prodromal and Manifest Lewy Body Dementia",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nSynaptic loss is theorized to occur early in the course of common neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as\nAlzheimer disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). Until recently, the evaluation of synaptic loss in the\nhuman brain depended on the availability of pathologic/autopsy material, which inevitably did not represent early\nstages of disease. In the past few years, development of radiopharmaceuticals that target SV2A, a ubiquitous\nsynaptic protein, have made it possible to quantify synaptic density in the human brain in vivo. One long-term\ngoal of the collaborative neuroimaging programs at UW-Madison is to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nand Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to understand and detect preclinical stages of neurodegeneration in\nAD and ADRD. The objective of this proposal is to use SV2A PET, acquired simultaneously with diffusion and\nstructural MRI, to evaluate the sequence and topography of synaptic, white matter microstructural, and\nvolumetric changes that correspond to prodromal and manifest stages of LBD. The central hypothesis is that\nlower synaptic density in neocortex and hippocampus will be detectable at earlier disease stages than reductions\nin white matter microstructural integrity and will correspond to or predict cognitive decline. The rationale for this\nproposal is that participants selected and carefully characterized to represent the spectrum of disease stages\nfrom healthy aging to prodromal LBD will provide a representative cohort from which to draw conclusions\nregarding the sequence of brain changes that occur prior to clinical disease onset. For this project we will recruit\n160 human research participants, 120 of whom have significant risk factors to develop LBD: Forty participants\nwith rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and normal cognition (RBD-NC), 40 participants with early-\nstage Parkinsonism and normal cognition (PD-NC), and 40 participants who meet research criteria for mild\ncognitive impairment with Lewy body (MCI-LB), as well as 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We are\nexperienced in and will perform extensive motor and cognitive characterization of these individuals at baseline\nand 2-year follow-up intervals. All participants will undergo structural and diffusion MRI as well as SV2A PET at\nbaseline; a subset of participants (~35) who show cognitive decline during the study will be re-imaged with SV2A\nPET/MRI at follow-up. Using the SV2A PET and MRI data, the specific aims will be to (1) map differences in\nsynaptic density between control, RBD-NC, PD-NC, and MCI-LB at baseline, (2) determine the relationship\nbetween synaptic density within prespecified neo and allocortical regions and cognitive decline, and (3)\ndetermine the degree to which reduced synaptic density occurs independent of microstructural and structural\nchange prior to dementia. The significance of this project is that it evaluates important hypotheses regarding\nthe role of synaptic loss as an early event in and cause of cognitive change in LBD. This project is innovative\nbecause few studies have evaluated SV2A in prodromal stages of LBD, including RBD and MCI-LB. The positive\nimpact of this work will be to develop biomarkers for the future evaluation of intervention therapies.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "The goal of this proposal is to further evaluate the safety and feasibility of gene transfer to provide aromatic L- amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme into the midbrain of patients with AADC deficiency and continue Biologics License Application (BLA)-enabling studies as per FDA recommendations. AADC deficiency is a devastating genetic neurometabolic disorder which causes hypotonia, dystonia, intense and long-lasting oculogyric crises (OGC), developmental delay and chronic and severe neurological dysfunction. A gene therapy based on delivering of a recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying the DDC human gene (AAV2-AADC) to the brain structures that physiologically AADC enzyme (midbrain) could be a most needed disease-modifying treatment for AADC deficiency. Eight (8) AADC deficient patients have been treated (160 \u00b5L) in our initial NIH- funded trial in the US under BB-IND-16127 and an additional 15 subjects under an ethics committee-approved compassionate use program (CUP) in Poland. The latter received a larger infusion volume (\u2264300 \u03bcL) and a shorter surgical procedure. Both approaches were safe and well-tolerated regardless of dose or volume of infusion. OGCs stopped a few weeks after the surgery and subjects\u2019 sleep, mood and irritability improved. Most subjects are gaining head control and muscular tone, developing purposeful movements and some are even sitting up and starting to walk without support, regardless of their age. Encouraged by the safety and positive biomarker and clinical outcomes observed in those groups, we propose an extension of the BB-IND-16127 study to (i) determine the long-term (up to 5 years) safety and tolerability of the surgical infusion of already treated subjects (n=8) (ii) determine the safety and tolerability of a larger volume of Cohort 2 vector concentration into the SN/VTA administered via a surgical procedure optimized to increase safety by reducing surgical and anesthesia times (single-cannula insertion per hemisphere) in AADC deficient patients >4 years, and (iii) demonstrate effective restoration of AADC function by measuring CSF neurotransmitter metabolites and changes in brain FDOPA uptake on PET imaging. This will be a multi-center study with subjects to be treated at The Ohio State University and at the University of California San Francisco. As per our discussions with FDA, the study design includes a 12-month lead-in period that will serve as a natural history control group to explore potential efficacy of this novel treatment. Cohorts 3 (4-13 years, n\u226412) and 4 (>13 years, n\u226412) will then receive a larger infusion volume of AAV2-AADC at the same titer Cohort 2 received (2.6 x 1012 vg/mL; up to 300 \u03bcL/hemisphere). Renewal of funding for this trial will enable assessment of the safety and tolerability of an optimized dose and delivery procedure to enhance distribution of AADC expression within the midbrain, which we hypothesize may lead to further clinical improvement. Completion of this exploratory clinical trial will pave the way to registration of this disease-modifying AAV2-hAADC gene therapy for AADC deficiency and future gene therapies for other neurological disorders.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Technology-based Sleep Self-Management Intervention for Adults with Subarachnoid Hemorrhage",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for 27% of all stroke-related years of potential life lost before 65\nyears of age. Sleep disturbance (insufficient sleep, poor quality) and daytime sleepiness (falling asleep during\nactivities) are highly prevalent following SAH. These symptoms negatively impact overall daily function and\nquality of life and increase healthcare use, yet often go undetected or untreated during clinical care. This\nproposed study builds upon our prior research, where we found that SAH survivors use patient activation and\nself-management strategies in an attempt to improve sleep (e.g., seek knowledge and skills, exercise or relax),\nbut become frustrated when there is no support or structure to aid their strategies. Our findings suggest that\ntargeted sleep self-management interventions focusing on patient activation improve sleep in this population.\nHowever, effective interventions focusing on sleep disturbance tailored to SAH have not been reported in the\nliterature. In this study, we will integrate input from SAH survivors and their caregivers, employ an iterative\nhuman-centered design using a mixed methods approach, and develop a technology-based intervention to\nimprove self-management skills (patient activation and engagement) for SAH survivors with sleep disturbance.\nWe will tailor the face-to-face Sleep BETTER 4-week intervention, effective in improving sleep in other chronic\nillness populations, to meet the unique needs of SAH survivors, and convert it to a technology-based format\nusing responsive-design web technology to support deployment over web, tablet, and mobile devices. This\nprogram includes six components: 1) bedroom environment, 2) exercise, 3) tension, 4) time in bed, 5) eating\nand drinking, and 6) rhythm for sleep-wake routines. In this study we aim to: 1) Tailor the Sleep BETTER\nintervention to meet the unique needs of SAH survivors (e.g., enhanced social support and self-management\nskills) to improve sleep disturbance (i.e., self-report sleep quality and daytime sleepiness; actigraphy total\nsleep time and sleep efficiency) with 32 SAH survivors and their caregivers, 2) Develop a technology-based\nintervention, using an iterative human-centered design and qualitative methods (i.e., iterative cycles of semi-\nstructured audio-recorded sessions) with 24 SAH survivors and their caregivers, 3) Refine and test the usability\nof a technology-based intervention, employing think-aloud observation sessions, the System Usability Scale,\nand semi-structured interviews with 32 SAH survivors and their caregivers, and 4) Assess the overall feasibility\nand acceptability of collecting primary (i.e., self-report sleep quality and daytime sleepiness; actigraphy total\nsleep time and sleep efficiency) and secondary measures (i.e., patient activation, motor or cognitive\nimpairments, and social support) to refine the intervention protocol.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nLast year, the care and treatment of roughly 6 million people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and related\ndementias cost the U.S. approximately $593 billion dollars. The tremendous costs associated with Alzheimer's\ndisease include direct medical costs, such as doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription drugs, as well as\nindirect costs such as lost wages and productivity for both the affected individuals and their caregivers. According\nto the Alzheimer's Association, the total cost of care for the estimated 13 million individuals with Alzheimer's and\nother dementias in the United States by 2050 is projected to reach $1.1 trillion. Emerging lifestyle intervention\nresearch is testing whether changes in physical exercise, sleep, socialization, and sedentary behaviors have an\nimpact on disease onset and progression of symptoms throughout the lifespan. Unfortunately, obtaining real-\nworld patient-generated health and behavior information to support this research from aging populations is\nchallenging and often relies on unreliable self-reporting. After years of meetings with 70+ investigators and\nscientists at the NIH, the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers,\nnumerous universities, and the Alzheimer's Association we determined and agreed that a consolidated database\nof real-life, digital health information does not exist for Alzheimer's and dementia research. During Amissa's\nSBIR Phase I, we created software to measure and collect physiological health data passively and unobtrusively\nfrom non-stigmatizing smartwatches including the Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy watch. This SBIR Phase\nII project is critical to expanding that R&D and improving remote health measurements, collecting and sharing\nrich digital health datasets, and identifying potential digital biomarkers that correlate to disease detection,\nprogression, and prevention. Our two software innovations will enable scientific researchers across the world to\nutilize consumer-grade smartwatches as passive remote patient monitoring solutions. Researchers, labs,\nuniversities, and healthcare practitioners will be able to create accounts on our platform, enroll her/his volunteer\nsubjects/patients for a study, and use our free software to collect longitudinal information including health vitals\nand behavior data. Specific Aim 1: Develop A Research Platform and Real-World Health Data Marketplace To\nSupport Academic Research and Enterprise Partnerships. During Phase II R&D, Amissa Health will collaborate\nwith experts from Wake Forest University, Harvard Medical School, the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease\nResearch Center, Atrium/Advocate Health, Edge Analytics, and Microsoft to develop the first shared research\nplatform that will apply longitudinal, real-world, wearable sensor measurements to advance research of\ndementia-related digital biomarkers and behavioral interventions. Specific Aim 2: Working with Edge Analytics,\na healthcare-focused data science firm that develops prototypes to production-ready algorithms, we will fine-\ntune edge computing algorithms and smartwatch sensor data collection and compression techniques to\nmaximize real-time health data measurement and collection areas with poor cellular and/or Wi-Fi networks.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary Abstract\n Sleep disturbances are a common facet of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) affecting 20-40% of\npatients in the mild to moderate stage of the illness. There is strong evidence that poor sleep\naccelerates the progress of AD through the failure to clear brian toxins during sleep. Research\nhas shown that promoting healthy sleep, specifically slow wave sleep (SWS), reversed the\naccelerating impacts of disrupted sleep in AD patients and reduced their annual increases in AD\nbiomarkers, reduced cognitive decline, stabilized depressive symptoms, and improved\npsychopathological behavior. There is increasing evidence that promoting sleep, specifically\nhealthy sleep architecture, reduces the risk of poor sleep accelerating AD. However, there are\ncurrently no approved therapies that are specifically designed to promote sleep and healthy\nsleep architecture in AD patients and patients at high risk for AD. Thus, there is a significant\nunmet clinical need to develop a sleep promoting device that is well tolerated by pre-AD and\nearly-stage AD patients.\n Our innovation is a device that promotes sleep onset, sleep duration, and the ideal sleep\nstage architecture including SWS, to prevent the disease accelerating impacts of disrupted\nsleep on AD patients. The goal of this Phase I project is to create a testable prototype that can\nsense sleep architecture and provide peripheral neuromodulation stimulation to individuals over\nthe age of 65, a group with an elevated risk of AD. Successful completion of this Phase I effort\nwill position us to demonstrate in clinical studies that our device improves SWS in early-stage\nAD patients and reduces AD biomarkers. Our final commercialized device will be a comfortable\nlow-profile medical device that promotes healthy sleep in high-risk and early-stage AD patients\nand reverses the accelerating effects of disrupted sleep for millions of AD patients.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nParkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects over 1 million U.S. citizens. PD is most\noften diagnosed in people over the age of 60, while only 4% of cases of PD are diagnosed before age 50, making\nage the biggest risk factor for the development of PD. The four cardinal features of PD include tremor, rigidity,\nbradykinesia, and postural instability, often associated with non-motor symptoms including depression, anxiety,\nsleep behavior disorders, constipation, loss of sense of smell, and cognitive impairment. The most prominent\nPD pathology is degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the ventrolateral tier of the pars compacta of the\nsubstantia nigra in the midbrain and the formation of \u03b1-synuclein cytoplasmic inclusions throughout the brain.\nWhile current medical therapies for PD significantly improve the quality of life of PD patients, none of these\ntherapies has been convincingly shown to slow or prevent the progression of PD, requiring the development of\ntreatments that can provide greater neuroprotection. To address these issues, Entobee Therapeutics\nproposes to repurpose N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a well-studied, safe, FDA-approved drug, to manage PD.\nGiven the pathogenetic role of oxidative damage in PD, Entobee hypothesizes that targeted antioxidant\nintervention with NAC may reduce or halt the progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration associated with\nPD. However, the administration of NAC has limitations in both intravenous and oral forms. Thus, Entobee\nproposes the creation of a novel intranasal (IN) nose-to-brain (N2B) treatment option to bypass first-pass hepatic\ngastrointestinal metabolism and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for faster outpatient and simple chronic care. The\noverall objective of this Phase I project is to identify a safe IN N2B dose of NAC with equivalent or better brain\nbioavailability compared to the 50 mg/kg i.v. NAC dose associated with dopaminergic improvement in PD\npatients using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure NAC-derived GSH in disease-relevant regions of\nthe brain. This will be accomplished through the following aims: 1) Establish the regional (striatum, midbrain, and\ncortex) and temporal (1\u20136 h and 24 h) single-dose bioavailability profile of 50 mg/kg i.v. NAC in PD patients, 2)\nCompare the single-dose bioavailability and safety profiles of 200 mg and 400 mg IN N2B NAC versus 50 mg/kg\ni.v. NAC bioavailability profile in PD patients, 3) Confirm the single-dose safety and tolerability of an equally\nbioavailable IN N2B NAC dose in PD patients.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nDisparities in lung disease and other chronic conditions between poor, mostly Black residents of public housing\ncommunities and the general population are profound, leading to an extraordinary human and economic\nburden. Rooted in structural inequalities, these disparities are exacerbated by the conditions of daily life,\nincluding housing and neighborhood physical (built) and social environment. Together, adverse housing and\nneighborhood conditions increase disease risk through multiple pathways, including behavioral and biological.\nDespite compelling evidence of the health effects of neighborhoods, few interventions have examined the\nextent to which specific modifications of housing and neighborhood conditions improve health outcomes. The\nproposed study, Housing, Environment, And Living Conditions for Transformed Health (HEALTHe\nBirmingham), aims to fill this research gap. Taking advantage of a major investment by federal and local\ngovernment, businesses, and organizations, we will evaluate, in a natural experiment, the health effects of a\ncomprehensive intervention that addresses multiple social determinants of health (SDoH): public housing\nquality and features of the neighborhood built and social environments (Aim 1). Recognizing that major\ncommunity revitalization efforts are not always possible, to generate solutions that are potentially more feasible\nand have wider reach, we also will conduct a prospective trial to determine whether less-expensive\nimprovements, such as indoor air purification, can positively impact lung health in public housing sites not\nundergoing housing renovation, comparing a site exposed to industrial pollution vs one less contaminated\n(Aim 2). To bolster the public health and policy implications of this research, we will conduct cost-effectiveness\nanalyses from economic and societal perspectives and use implementation science to prioritize intervention\nstrategies, recommend scale-up efforts across communities and contexts, and inform policy on federal and\nlocal levels. We also will assess the extent to which specific components impact health equity between\nintervention and control communities (Aim 3). Study findings will facilitate translation of SDoH interventions\ninto practice, inform public policy across locations and contexts, and contribute to the evidence base of\nreducing health inequity through action on SDoH.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nThe objective of this project is to develop an innovative ring sensor system, to be worn on the finger, for the\ndiagnosis and monitoring of Parkinson's disease (PD) in underserved rural populations. Rural regions of the US\nhave been observed to be disproportionately impacted by PD due to higher rates of diagnosis, while also lacking\naccess to neurologists and other allied health professionals, who are overconcentrated in urban areas with\nacademic medical centers. As a result, rural PwPD may be diagnosed later in the disease process and have\nfewer specialty care visits which leads to increased hospitalizations, morbidity and decreased quality of life. The\nproposed inexpensive, easy-to-use ring can be worn daily, adjustable to any finger and used to support both\nearly diagnosis and ongoing symptom management. This ring could be used as a screening tool to detect PD\nand alert primary care physicians (PCP) much earlier than typical. It could also be used as a tool to aid in the\nremote management of PD as movement disorder specialists could use the data to assess medication timing\nand management or deep brain stimulation (DBS) programming settings. The proposed system is designed with\na rural low-income user in mind. No Internet connection or smartphone/computer technology is required.\nWearable sensors for medical use in PD patients are plagued with usability concerns, many focused on the\nstigma associated with wearing them in prominent locations. They also typically require a smartphone, app\nand/or Internet connectivity which may limit their applicability for rural populations. There is therefore a need for\na discreet device without the need for Internet connectivity to be useful for rural PwPD. Newly available\nultraminiature high-capacity curved battery and IMU technologies make the proposed ring technically feasible at\nthis time.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Poor sleep health (e.g., insufficient sleep duration, fragmented sleep, untreated sleep disorders) is associated\nwith increased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD). Poor sleep health also increases soluble Amyloid \u03b2eta and\ntau concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid suggesting a potential mechanism for sleep disturbance to promote\nAD pathogenesis. All of these could increase the risk for AD, meaning that poor sleep health and untreated\nsleep disorders are potential catalysts for AD risk, and that improving sleep may be a modifiable target for AD\nprevention among older adults. Sleep difficulties remain unaddressed among many older adults, especially\nthose in low resource settings, such as among residents of low-income housing facilities. Our team (the Sleep\nMatters Initiative) has an established, effective Sleep Health and Wellness (SHAW) program, comprised of\nsleep and sleep disorders education. We propose to expand the SHAW program to include mindfulness, the\nEastern practice of focused concertation in the present moment, which has been shown to improve sleep,\nreduce stress, and strengthen cognitive function in older adults. Guided by User Centered Design, we will\nconduct iterative stages of feedback from older adults and prototyping, that will ensure the sleep and\nmindfulness messages and materials are accessible, usable, and feasible for cognitively unimpaired older\nadults (age 55 years and above) in low-income housing in Boston. Given that networks of trusted other seniors\nare essential sources of information and influence, we propose a novel social network approach, that will\nidentify opinion leaders in low-income housing facilities and engage these individuals as Sleep Health\nChampions (SHCs) to aid in diffusing the adapted SHAW materials and resources through interpersonal\ncommunication and small group sessions. Our objective in this R34 is to culturally adapt the SHAW and\nmindfulness modules to the needs of cognitively unimpaired older adults in low-income housing facilities, then\nconduct a feasibility and acceptability pilot study of the proposed social network approach to deliver the\nadapted SHAW program to cognitively unimpaired older adults in low-income housing in Boston with the aim of\nimproving sleep, quality of life (QoL), and cognitive function. We will conduct the proposed planning activities\nand feasibility study in close collaboration with our longtime partner, the City of Boston Age Strong\nCommission. The culturally adapted SHAW and mindfulness program will be evaluated in a planned cluster\nrandomized controlled trial in cognitively unimpaired seniors in low-income housing in Boston on sleep health\nbehaviors, QoL, and cognitive function in a planned R01 that will be submitted in Year 3 of this award. It is\nhypothesized that exposure to the adapted, SHC-deployed SHAW and mindfulness intervention in the planned\nR01 will be associated with improved sleep, QoL, and markers of cognitive decline.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract:\n Modification of risky health behaviors to improve brain health and early detection of the disease are\npivotal components to alleviate the societal burden of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD).\nBoth these components are heavily influenced by individuals' in-person and online social ties. Social media has\nbecome predominant as a source of information for many individuals as they seek health-related information and\ncare. However, our understanding of the ways through which we can effectively harness these social\nmechanisms to support individuals' care-seeking behaviors and behavior change efforts is quite limited. In the\nproposed research, we will seek to develop a methodological framework that enables us to (a) examine\nindividual- and group-level dynamics associated with information-seeking and care-seeking behaviors in in-\nperson and digital contexts for risk reduction and early detection of ADRD, and (b) model population-level\nnetwork diffusion characteristics and their relationship with individuals' behavioral state/stage, resistance to\nmisinformation, manifestation of sociobehavioral processes. Grounded in theories of human behavior, cognitive\npsychology, and network sciences, we will employ mixed-methods approach to analyze social dynamics using\ndata collected through surveys and interviews in in-person settings and ADRD-related peer interactions in online\nsocial media platforms. Specifically, we will employ theories (e.g., Integrated Behaviora Model, Transtheoretical\nModel of Change, Case seeking delay model) and methods that facilitate granular (e.g., grounded theory\nanalysis), high-throughput (e.g., natural language processing, deep learning), and collective (e.g., ego-centered\nnetworks, affiliation networks) modeling of information seeking and care seeking behaviors as self-reported in\nsurveys and as manifested in online social media. While generally applicable, the methods will be developed\nbased on communications among individuals engaging in social intercourse related to risk reduction and early\ndetection of ADRD. This research proposal will result in 1) novel methods to incorporate behavioral/care seeking\nstages and processes into network models of social influence and 2) new proposals for the development of\nnetwork interventions that harness social ties and behavioral constructs to support individuals engaging in\nmodification of risky health behaviors and care seeking behaviors within and beyond ADRD domain.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary: This K01 NINDS Award will provide Dr. Yohannes Woldeamanuel with intensive, supervised\ntraining to help him become an independent research scientist focusing on headache medicine, more specifically\non managing migraine using health-promoting lifestyle behaviors (e.g. regular exercise). Using this K01 Award,\nDr. Woldeamanuel will get the support necessary to complete the following goals: (a) become skilled in clinical\ntrials involving behavioral interventions to manage migraine, (b) train in statistical and bioinformatics methods,\n(c) to gain proficiency in mass spectrometry, assays, and quantification, (d) develop activities and scholarship\naimed at career development goals to become an independent investigator. To achieve these goals, Dr.\nWoldeamanuel has assembled a team of mentors: Drs. Robert Cowan (Primary Mentor), Oxana Palesh (Co-\nMentor), Jamie Zeitzer (Co-Mentor), Michael Snyder (Co-Mentor), Ying Lu (Advisor), Allis Chien (Advisor).\nResearch: Increasingly, migraine patients prefer non-drug treatment options and often discontinue drug\ntreatment due to adverse effects, poor compliance, and cost issues. Currently, there is no direct evidence\ndemonstrating the utility of regular lifestyle behavior (RLB i.e. regular sleep, exercise, mealtime) to manage\nchronic migraine. This proposal is the first to conduct a feasibility and pilot testing study of RLB in managing\nchronic migraine using the following specific aims. Primary Aim: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of\nRLB in chronic migraine patients. Secondary Aim: To examine the preliminary efficacy of RLB in managing\nchronic migraine as measured by reduction in monthly migraine days. Mechanistic Exploratory Aim: To examine\ncandidate biomarkers that predict chronic migraine patients who are RLB-responders. The development, pilot\ntesting, and validation RLB-based migraine therapy will have a positive impact in the headache field by providing\na framework for development of efficacious lifestyle-based self-management protocols. By demonstrating it to\nbe equipotent to daily medications, lifestyle medicine can have the added value of obviating medication risks\nand unwanted side-effects common among chronic migraine sufferers. The proposed research is innovative\nbecause its successful completion will pilot test a novel method by utilizing RLB as a self-management tool in\nmanaging migraine. In addition, this proposed research will use multi-omics to elucidate underlying biological\nmechanisms of RLB therapy. Application of system biology technology will create a paradigm shift from current\nheadache research concentrating on single molecule. This approach will be the first of its kind in the headache\nfield in providing proof-of-principle that personalized lifestyle-based protocols can be used to manage migraine.\nThis research will form the basis for an R01 application of a full-scale clinical trial before the end of the K award.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nThe current standard measure of OSA, the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) underestimates women\u2019s OSA\nseverity compared to men, which may lead to missed diagnoses, thus increasing women\u2019s risk for\ncardiovascular disease, metabolic and mood disorders, and poor daytime functioning. Most of the early\nevidence to support the use of AHI as a measure of OSA severity has been validated in men. There is a\npressing need to identify a reliable biomarker of OSA severity in order to minimize sex and gender inequities in\nin diagnosis and management of OSA. We propose to assess night-to-night variability in novel OSA severity\nmetrics and assess their impact on day-to-day sleepiness, fatigue, mood, and stress towards characterization\nof reliable biomarkers of disease severity. The proposed study will leverage cutting-edge sleep monitoring\ntechnology (Cerebra Sleep System) supporting the data collection in the participant\u2019s home over 7 nights. The\nstudy will also collect daytime functioning information several times per day via ecological momentary\nassessments (EMA). We will enroll participants from two Sleep Medicine Centers associated with the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh and the University of Kansas Medical Center which will allow for a robust recruitment of\n300 participants, 100 men, and 200 women balanced by menopausal status. Using available multiple night\nrecordings, we will assess the within- and between-subject variability of key sleep-disordered breathing\nphysiological traits (total and sleep stage-specific AHI, hypoxic burden, and pulse rate responses to respiratory\nevents and to arousals) and determine the role of sex as a potential contributor of between-subject variability in\nthese traits (Aim 1). Next, we will assess the temporal relationship between novel OSA severity parameters,\nsleep traits and daytime function using key objective (sleep duration, architecture, depth, microstructure) and\nself-reported sleep traits, as well as EMA of daytime sleepiness, fatigue, mood, and stress (Aim 2). We will\nassess the temporal effects of OSA severity parameters on daytime function, determine whether these effects\nare mediated by objective sleep traits, and establish whether sex and gender moderate these associations.\nOur central hypothesis is that men and women require distinct definitions of OSA severity, because the\nmechanisms explaining how sleep disordered breathing impact daytime functioning will be different between\nsexes. This study has the potential to create a new paradigm in OSA research that will lead to novel\napproaches to OSA severity definitions and improve long term health outcomes for women and men.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Natural History of Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency (SSADHD), a Heritable Disorder of GABA Metabolism",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "SUMMARY \u2013 Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADHD) is a rare genetic disease caused by\nimpaired \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission. Since SSADHD was first identified in 1983, research\nhas focused on identifying the spectrum of pathogenic ALDH5A1 mutations, understanding the molecular and\nbiochemical bases of disease presentation, and testing promising therapeutics. To date, however, there remain\nsignificant knowledge gaps that are barriers to early detection and prognosis of the disease, and to the\nassessment of the efficacy of novel promising therapeutics. These gaps include a comprehensive description of\nthe natural course of the clinical severity of the disease, an in-depth assessment of the neurophysiology of the\ndisease, and the prognostic value of biochemical markers. We began to address these knowledge gaps four\nyears ago with our currently funded natural history study (NHS) of SSADHD and have already demonstrated\nsignificant correlations between age of the patients, severity of the disease, blood biomarkers, and\nneurophysiological parameters. However, the 4-5 year span of the current study and varying age and clinical\nseverity of the study participants has mostly afforded a cross-sectional perspective on disease progression and\nthe prognostic value of biomarkers. In order to gain the longitudinal insight needed to assess the predictive power\nof disease markers at study intake on prognosis, a longer follow-up of the participants is needed. The purpose\nof this application is to extend this natural history study for five years. We propose the following aims: 1) to\ndetermine patient-specific changes over time in the clinical severity of SSADHD, 2) to determine patient-specific\nchanges over time in neurophysiological markers known to be dependent on GABA homeostasis, and 3) to\ndetermine patient-specific changes over time in biochemical markers known to be abnormal in SSADHD. To\naccomplish these aims, the study will follow ~70 patients representing ~30% of all known cases worldwide. The\nproject will be led by research teams at three academic institutions and is supported by patient advocacy groups\nand families from all over the world. The research will provide the clinical and biochemical information needed\nto predict the natural course of the disease, monitor the success of future therapeutic trials, and provide a strong\nrationale for adding SSADHD screening to existing NBS panels.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "BMAL1 Circadian Clock Complexes from Mammalian Brain",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\n The circadian clock is an endogenous ~24-hour oscillator that drives daily rhythms of biological\nprocesses. In mammals, circadian clocks are found in the brain and peripheral tissues. Together, the\ndistributed clocks constitute the basic timing system regulating behavior, physiology, and metabolism.\n The mammalian circadian clock is built on a transcriptional negative feedback loop that generates\ncircadian rhythms at the molecular level. The transcription factor BMAL1 is at the heart of this feedback\nloop, acting as the positive element activating circadian clock transcription. Long-standing evidence\nsuggests that peripheral clocks and brain clocks differ with respect to BMAL1. In the periphery, BMAL1\ntranscriptional action (and clock function) requires the heterodimeric partner CLOCK, whereas in the brain\neither CLOCK or NPAS2, a protein related to CLOCK, suffices to sustain the role of BMAL1 in clock\nfunction. Circadian clocks in the brain thus possess a redundancy not found in peripheral clocks.\n We recently developed procedures for purifying native BMAL1 activator complexes from bovine\ncerebral cortex, making large-scale purification for biochemical and structural studies of brain circadian\nclock complexes practical. We find that BMAL1 activator complexes from brain are exclusively ~750 kDa\nin mass, much larger than a free heterodimer and similar to what we previously observed in the periphery.\nThe complexes can be purified into two populations, one including BMAL1 and CLOCK (as in the\nperiphery), the other BMAL1 and NPAS2 (not found in the periphery). Electron microscopy revealed the\ncomplexes to be discreet particles of ~20 nm in diameter, consistent with the estimated mass.\n The composition of these complexes is unknown; as expected of activator complexes, they do not\nappear to include circadian negative feedback proteins. Their mass is sufficient for roughly 10-12 proteins\nof average size. The full molecular identity and structure of the circadian clock transcriptional activators\nare thus not yet known, a fundamental gap in our understanding. The goal of this application is to analyze\nthe composition of the two BMAL1 complexes purified from brain and develop procedures for determining\ntheir three-dimensional structures by cryo-electron microscopy. If successful, the project offers to deepen\nour knowledge of circadian clock transcription, provide potential new drug targets for circadian\ntherapeutics, and reveal differences between brain and peripheral clocks.\n Advances in understanding the circadian clock are important for our knowledge of behavior and\nphysiology, as well as for human health and disease. Clock defects produce disrupted sleep-wake cycles,\nmetabolic syndrome, and increased cancer incidence and are linked to bipolar disorder. The proposed\ninvestigation aims to provide fundamental insights into the biological timing system essential for health.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "2Morrow, Inc. CRP Grant Application \u2013 Project Summary:\nChronic pain affects roughly 1 in 5 adults. Managing chronic pain is complex, and the reality for most patients\nis that living a life free of pain is unlikely. Over 50% of patients with chronic pain also experience depression or\nanxiety, and medical providers often lack the time, training or resources to address these emotional challenges.\nThis can leave patients feeling uncared about and providers feeling frustrated. Despite national guidelines that\nrecommend incorporating scalable behavioral interventions when managing pain, there continues to be an\noverreliance on addictive pain medications. Given the need for HEAL-aligned pain management options such\nas behavioral-based treatments, 2Morrow set out to design, develop, and test a novel evidence-based digital\nbehavioral therapeutic for individuals living with chronic pain with FAST-TRACK SBIR HEAL grant funding (#1\nR44 AT 11593) aimed at reducing the negative impact of pain on daily life with educational content, skill\ndevelopment, pain awareness tools, and coaching. Our SBIR feasibility RCT study is nearing completion\n(August 2024) and shows strong engagement, positive feedback, and a decrease in pain interference. Our\nfocus is now shifting to dissemination and commercialization. The landscape for digital therapeutics presents\nunique challenges, notably in the realms of investment expectations and the absence of established payment\nand commercialization models. This complexity is compounded by the fact that, typically, it takes about 17\nyears for evidence-based practices to gain widespread adoption in the medical community. To counter this\ntrend and expedite the integration of our digital therapeutic, we need to validate commercial traction. Thus we\nare applying for this HEAL Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) Program: Embedded Entrepreneurs for\nSmall Businesses in Pain Management (SB1 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) that will fund the hiring of a Chief\nCommercial Officer (CCO) to accelerate the dissemination and commercialization of this product by focusing\non partner development.\nSpecific Aim 1: Hire a fractional (50% effort) CCO or equivalent experienced professional. Specific Aim 2:\nDuring the first 90 days, the CCO will review, validate, and update 2Morrow\u2019s commercialization plan. To do\nthis they will meet with the 2Morrow team, and at least 10 stakeholders or industry experts to 1) understand the\nlandscape and current business models, 2) understand current options and workflow, and 3) validate/refine\n2Morrow\u2019s go-to-market strategy. Specific Aim 3: The CCO will execute the commercialization/partnership\nplan with a focus on advancing a business development pipeline that leads to key milestones such as a signed\npartnership agreement or strategic investment.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Cognitive fluctuations \u2013termed \u201cthe Lewy Body Roller Coaster\u201d by some families \u2013 are a debilitating symptom\nof Lewy body disorders (LBD), an Alzheimer\u2019s disease related disorder that includes Parkinson\u2019s Disease\ndementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies. These unpredictable cognitive changes often lead to the loss of\nindependence in patients that could otherwise function. They are characterized by dramatic changes in two key\ndomains: attention (ability to focus/think) and arousal (ability to stay alert/awake). Presence of fluctuations are\na key feature used to diagnose LBD. Despite this, a basic understanding of fluctuations is lacking.\nOur long-term goal is to determine the underlying mechanisms responsible for cognitive fluctuations in LBD\nsuch that targeted, effective treatments can be developed. Animal models allow induction of pathology in\nrestricted brain circuits, providing the opportunity to address key basic and translational questions regarding\nthe origin of variability in attention and arousal. In this proposal, we will use injection of the fibrillar form of\nalpha-synuclein, the protein associated with LBD, into one hub of the brainstem ascending arousal network\nwhich is highly affected in patients with this disease. We will use mouse models to test the overarching\nhypothesis that alpha-synuclein differentially impacts large projecting neurons in the brainstem that orchestrate\nbrain-wide networks necessary for attention and maintenance of arousal. In Aim 1 we will evaluate which cells\nare vulnerable to pathology. We will focus on one brainstem region, the Locus Coeruleus, which shows\npathology in almost all patients with LBD. We will count cells and use live imaging to directly track changes in\naxons from this arousal hub. Then, in Aim 2 and 3 we will determine how alpha-synuclein inclusions affect\narousal and attention, respectively. In Aim 2 we will evaluate arousal using continuous EEG in the context of\ntime-of-day, as well as after exposure to novelty in the home cage. In Aim 3, we will evaluate cognitive\nvariability using a repeatable timing-task combined with pupillometry and imaging at the single-cell level.\nThis proposal uses a combination of translatable non-invasive techniques (EEG, pupillometry) with powerful\nlaboratory methods able to probe individual neuronal activity. The findings will help us better explain findings\nseen in human patients. Understanding the processes occurring during cognitive fluctuations is key to\neventually developing treatment targets, including non-invasive neuromodulation of abnormal neuronal activity\nand pharmacological modulation of identified neuronal populations.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Clinical Problem: Up to 48.5% of adolescent and young adult (AYA, 15 \u2013 39 years old) cancer survivors\nexperience clinically relevant anxiety. Anxiety disrupts the successful achievement of normative developmental\ntasks and is associated with fear of cancer recurrence and decreased quality of life. Cognitive behavioral\ntherapy is a guideline-based recommendation for anxiety, but only 40% of AYAs seek out such treatments, and\nstigma regarding psychotherapy is high, particularly among individuals of diverse backgrounds.\nOverall Objective: Music-based interventions offer an evidence-based treatment for anxiety in adults with\ncancer. Despite the growth of studies, approximately 8% of trials have included AYA/pediatric cancer patients.\nThe overall objective is to determine the feasibility of conducting an eight-week, (45 min/week), virtually-\ndelivered, tailored music-based relaxation (TiMBRe) intervention to decrease anxiety in AYA cancer survivors.\nTiMBRe uses tailored music experiences, delivered by a board-certified music therapist, to develop greater\nself-awareness and use of music-based relaxation to increase self-efficacy to cope and manage anxiety.\nNeed for Planning Study: The primary aim of our future, phase II, multicenter randomized controlled trial is to\ndetermine the efficacy of a virtual, TiMBRe intervention to reduce anxiety in AYA cancer survivors with\nclinically relevant anxiety. Our preliminary data (N=37) demonstrate that the implementation of a four-session\n(45 min each), virtual TiMBRe intervention for AYAs with cancer is feasible and well accepted by AYAs, with a\nmajority (13/21, [67%]) of AYAs with anxiety reporting clinically significant changes in their anxiety pre-to post-\nintervention. However, we must first address several planning issues that will prepare the protocol for\nsuccessful implementation and completion in a randomized controlled trial.\nR34 Specific Aims: The primary aim is to determine the feasibility of implementing a randomized controlled\ntrial of an eight-week, virtual, TiMBRe intervention in post-treatment AYA cancer survivors with clinically\nrelevant anxiety. Secondarily, we will determine the credibility of an attention control condition for virtual\nTiMBRe and develop fidelity measures to ensure standardized delivery of virtual TiMBRe across therapists.\nMethods: Using an explanatory-sequential mixed methods design, we will first randomize 50 AYA cancer\nsurvivors with clinically relevant anxiety from the University of Michigan to the eight-week TiMBRe intervention\nor attention-control (i.e., study staff calls + cancer survivorship resources). Participants will complete patient-\nreported outcome measures (e.g., PROMIS Anxiety 4a) at baseline, four, eight, and twenty weeks. TiMBRe\ngroup participants will participate in semi-structured interviews to evaluate intervention acceptability.\nExpected Outcomes: The expected outcome is the demonstration that virtual TiMBRe intervention delivery is\nfeasible within a randomized-controlled trial, with further data supporting a credible attention control and\neffective intervention fidelity methods. Results will inform a phase II efficacy trial.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThis project will develop, test, apply, and disseminate multilevel statistical models and software for estimating\neffects of intraindividual means, variances, slopes generated from multi-burst and continuous ILD designs to\npredict cancer control behaviors and outcomes. Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality. Approximately\n42% of new cancer cases in the U.S. are viewed as potentially avoidable including 19% caused by smoking and\n18% caused by excess body weight, physical inactivity, excess alcohol consumption, and poor nutrition.\nIntensive Longitudinal Data (ILD) methods, which collect many assessments captured at high density on a micro-\ntimescale (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours) using real-time data capture methodologies (e.g., Ecological\nMomentary Assessment [EMA] and accelerometry), offer enormous opportunities for insight into the dynamic\nnature of cancer control behaviors and outcomes. In ILD studies, it is common to have hundreds to thousands\nof observations per subject, and this allows us to model intraindividual parameters comprised of time-varying\nvariables such as means (e.g., how unhappy is a subject, on average, across occasions?), variances (e.g., how\nerratic is a subject\u2019s mood across occasions?), and slopes (e.g., is a subject\u2019s mood related to feelings of energy\nacross occasions?). In our prior work, we developed a software, called MixWILD, consisting of a series of two-\nstage multilevel statistical models testing the effects of intraindividual means, variances, and slopes on time-\nvarying and subject-level outcomes. The next generation of ILD studies has begun to use multi-burst (e.g.,\nmultiple day EMA periods interspersed with days with no assessment) and continuous (e.g., 24-hour/days per\nweek smartwatch accelerometry) measurement designs, allowing the entire study to extend across months or\nyears. However, available data analysis techniques cannot address common substantive questions that arise\nwith multi-burst and continuous ILD designs such as does momentary mood variability increase across a year?\nAlso, do month-to-month increases in momentary mood variability predict declines in sleep duration over a year?\nTo address these gaps, we will develop multilevel models capable of (Aim 1) jointly estimating how within-burst\nmeans, variability, and slopes differ between bursts and/or subjects, (Aim 2) testing predictors (either occasion,\nburst-, person-level) of how within-burst means, variability, and slopes differ between bursts and/or subjects, and\n(Aim 3) testing whether random effects from Aim 1 predict subject- and burst-level cancer control outcomes. We\nwill test and apply these statistical features by conducting secondary analyses of data from a multi-burst ILD\nstudy of cancer control behaviors and outcome, which conducted mobile sensing, EMA, and accelerometry from\n246 emerging adults (ages 18-29) across 12 months.

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Sleep, pain, and recovery in kids after pediatric intensive care (SPARK-PICU)",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nMore than 250,000 children survive pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) hospitalization each year in the United\nStates, yet we have an incomplete understanding of recovery trajectory and modifiable factors to optimize\nsurvivorship. PICU survivors have multisystem diseases and suffer multisystem morbidities many years after\nhospital discharge in physical, cognitive, and psychosocial health domains. Our preliminary data indicate\npresence of clinically significant pain among 1 in 3 children and sleep disturbances in over 50% of children\nmonths to years after PICU hospitalization, placing them at risk for poorer long-term health outcomes.\nHowever, key knowledge gaps remain in understanding risk factors and mechanisms for persistent pain and\nsleep disturbances in PICU survivors, limiting potential interventions that could have broad implications for\nlong-term recovery. For example, PICU survivors are known to suffer substantial cognitive impairments,\nparticularly within the executive function construct, crucial to long-term academic achievement, quality of life,\nand psychosocial well-being. Chronic pain and sleep disturbances are potentially modifiable, and linked to\nworse executive function in other pediatric populations. However, we have an incomplete understanding of the\nimpact of pain and sleep on executive function outcomes in PICU survivors. The central hypothesis of this\nproposal is that pain and sleep disturbances are important post-PICU morbidities that are key mediators\nbetween acute illness factors, psychosocial vulnerabilities and executive function outcomes in children after\ncritical illness.\nWe will conduct a longitudinal outcomes study of PICU survivors aged 8-18 years with the following objectives:\n1) Identify pain trajectories and biopsychosocial risk factors for chronic pain in PICU survivors; 2) Elucidate\nlongitudinal sleep disturbances in PICU survivors and sleep-pain associations over 12 months; 3) Test the\nimpact of sleep and pain on EF outcomes in PICU survivors over 12-months. The study will utilize objective\nmeasures of acute illness severity, novel metrics of psychosocial vulnerabilities, and a mix of objective\nassessment and subjective report of pain, sleep, and executive function outcomes to comprehensively\nevaluate temporal and mediating relationships 3, 6, and 12-months after PICU hospitalization. This proposal is\nsignificant because it addresses the common and debilitating morbidities of chronic pain and sleep\ndisturbances that affect thousands of PICU survivors annually. Our data will identify risk factors across a\nbiopsychosocial framework to improve identification and treatment of pain and sleep disturbances, and aligns\nwith the National Institutes of Health Sleep Disorders Research Plan and Federal Pain Research Strategy. This\nresearch will provide a greater understanding of sleep, pain, and executive function in PICU survivors key for\ndesigning and implementing interventions aimed at optimizing recovery.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Neural basis underlying the impact of stress on sleep",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nStress is associated with insufficient sleep and poor quality sleep. In particular, fragmented non-rapid eye\nmovement sleep (NREMs) due to frequent brief arousals (microarousals, MAs) disrupts sleep continuity, and\nrapid eye movement sleep (REMs) abnormalities are often observed in patients with insomnia and depression.\nInsufficient sleep and alterations in sleep microarchitecture caused by stress may in turn worsen the stress\nsymptoms, such as cognitive impairment, and have been shown to increase the risk of developing psychiatric\ndisorders. Nevertheless, the identity of the involved stress- and sleep-regulatory circuits, and the mechanisms\nby which stress perturbs distinct features of the sleep architecture and negatively impacts cognitive behaviors\nare still largely unclear. We have recently shown that acute psychosocial stress in mice decreases the amount\nof sleep and disrupts sleep quality by causing frequent MAs and suppressing REMs. We propose that the\nstress-induced decrease in the amount of sleep and changes in sleep microarchitecture are mediated by\ndifferent circuit mechanisms. The preoptic area of the hypothalamus (POA), a crucial center regulating macro-\nand microarchitecture of sleep and wakefulness, is densely innervated by stress-regulatory noradrenergic\nneurons in the locus coeruleus (NELC) and corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular\nnucleus (CRHPVN). The goal of this proposal is to investigate to what extent the NELC and CRHPVN neurons\ncause stress-induced sleep disturbances and memory impairment via projections to distinct POA\nsubpopulations. Our central hypothesis is that stress-induced MAs and REMs dysregulation are mediated by\ninputs from NELC neurons to the POA (NELC\u2192POA), while the overall decrease in sleep is mediated by inputs\nfrom CRHPVN neurons (CRHPVN\u2192POA) and that reversing sleep disturbances attenuates stress-induced memory\ndeficits. Aim 1 will determine the role of NELC\u2192POA projections in stress-induced MAs and REMs dysregulation\nas well as related memory deficits. Aim 2 will determine the role of CRHPVN\u2192POA projections in stress-induced\nwakefulness and related memory deficits. Accomplishing these aims will provide important insights into the\nneural basis of stress-induced sleep disturbances and the benefits of good quality and quantity sleep in\nreversing stress symptoms, with potential relevance to understand and develop novel therapeutic interventions\nfor stress-related sleep disorders.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract:\nAsthma inequitably impacts under-resourced, Black, and Hispanic youth who experience higher asthma\nmorbidity. These disparities are partially explained by social adversity experienced at multiple levels (child,\nfamily, community). Yet, these critical associations between social adversity and pediatric asthma are not fully\nincorporated into strategies to address morbidity among children which may exacerbate existing inequities,\nmeaning such at-risk children experience decreased quality of life, higher school absenteeism, and decreased\neducational and employment achievement in late childhood and adulthood. In this proposal, Dr. Tyris\u2019 objective\nis to advance the existing knowledge on social adversity and asthma morbidity with diverse methodologies that\nseek to better integrate social care (activities mitigating health-related adverse social factors) into medical care\nfor children. She will pursue this overall objective through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Predict risk of\nhospitalization among DC children with asthma using multi-level social adversity indicators. A population-based\nmachine learning model using the DC Pediatric Asthma Registry (n= >19,000) and social adversity, clinical,\nand demographic data will be developed to predict risk of asthma-related hospitalization and to identify which\nvariables are most predictive of children at highest risk for hospitalization. Aim 2: Characterize caregiver\nperspectives of mechanisms to address modifiable family-level variables that impact child asthma morbidity. A\ncommunity advisory board will be established to conduct longitudinal focus groups and engage with caregivers\nof children frequently hospitalized for asthma to refine family-level approaches to address social adversity and\nenhance recruitment and retention issues for a pilot RCT. Aim 3: Determine feasibility and acceptability of an\nintegrated social care intervention of individualized assistance and adjustment strategies among caregivers of\nchildren with asthma. Dr. Tyris will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to determine if using addressing\nsocial adversity in routine asthma care with assistance (helping resolve social adversity) and adjustment\n(modifying health care to overcome social barriers) will be acceptable to caregivers and feasible to implement.\nThe outlined career development plan, including the proposed aims, will enable Dr. Tyris to gain advanced\ntraining and knowledge in four key areas: machine learning methods for risk prediction, stakeholder-engaged\nintervention design, clinical trial design and execution, and integrated social and medical care interventions.\nShe will leverage the expertise of Dr. Tyris\u2019 mentors (Drs. Teach and Parikh) and advisors (Drs. Trujillo Rivera,\nHinds, and Gottlieb) and the robust, supportive research environment at Children\u2019s National Hospital and\nGeorge Washington University. Successful completion of this career development and research proposal will\nfacilitate Dr. Tyris\u2019 overarching career goal to become an independent and federally funded investigator who\ncreates, implements, evaluates, and effectively translates stakeholder-engaged solutions designed to mitigate\nsocial adversity, promote health equity, and improve care and outcomes for children with asthma.",

Dr. Gorvine is an Instructor/ Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Health Behavior and\nHealth Education in the College of Public Health, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS).\n Jail incarceration rates in the United States have tripled since the 1980s. More than 3,100 jails\nnationwide serviced 10.8 million jail admissions in 2018. Jail correctional officers (COs) are responsible for\nmaintaining security and supervising detainees in facilities that are often low-resourced (e.g. funding, staffing\nshortages), are overcrowded, and replete with health risk exposures (e.g. Covid-19). Therefore, COs\nexperience high levels of stress due to violence and low autonomy. The high risk of adverse mental health\noutcomes and health disparities among COs necessitates addressing CO stress management in jail settings.\n The study will use an evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) method to achieve the first 2 aims\nincluding: 1) identifying barriers and facilitators to implementing a stress management intervention for\ncorrectional officers in a jail setting through formative evaluation (e.g. in-depth qualitative interviews with key\njail stakeholders); 2) developing an implementation strategy package and intervention modifications. Thirdly,\nconduct a pilot hybrid type II effectiveness-implementation trial of the stress management intervention for\ncorrectional officers at the jail, measuring implementation outcomes of acceptability, appropriateness,\nfeasibility, and fidelity of the intervention and the implementation strategy package.\n The training goals of the K01 Mentored Research Scientist Career Development award include: 1)\ndeveloping expertise in implementation research methods related to intervention delivery in jails; 2) enhance\nskills in community-engaged research with partners within criminal justice settings; 3) learning how to build\ncommunity-engaged partnerships in the jail; 4) developing expertise in evidence-based mind-body intervention\ndelivery and research; and 5) Increase biostatistics expertise to be fully informed for in-depth collaboration with\nbiostatisticians.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThere is a shortage of well-trained research-oriented physicians who are prepared to develop new\napproaches to prevent, diagnose and treat childhood respiratory diseases. This limited pool of well-\nestablished investigators is further threatened by a decreasing number of young physician scientists who\nchoose to specialize in pediatric respiratory disciplines. Training at all levels is an important priority at\nCincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital which has established extensive programs for developing MD, PHD and\nMD/PhD fellows and faculty into independent clinical and basic science investigators.\nThe Pediatric Pulmonary Division at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is uniquely\npositioned to interest students in careers focused on pediatric respiratory disorders. Pulmonary research at\nCCHMC has very strong and diverse clinical and basic science research programs and the Sleep Disorder\nCenter is one of the few pediatric programs in the United States that has a certified pediatric sleep fellowship\nprogram with an extensive research focus.\nThis proposal will provide a 10 week summer research fellowship for 12 medical\nstudents following their first year of medical school. The program has a well-organized method of selection of\ntrainees from a competitive pool of medical students with outstanding academic qualifications. A faculty of\nover 35 MDs, PhDs and MD/PhDs from multiple departments with a proven record of success in research\nand mentoring are available to the trainees. All investigators are well-funded in NHLBI-focused research\nareas focused on pediatric respiratory disorders. Included within the program are opportunities to pursue\nbasic and clinical research projects with weekly meetings at which instruction in responsible conduct of\nresearch and specific clinical and research topics in pulmonary and sleep medicine are provided.\nStudents present their projects to peers and mentors at the end of summer symposium. Past trainees\nrate the program highly on research education received and report a very high interest in pursuing careers\nin research at the end of the summer. Past trainees have been consistently successful in publishing\nmanuscripts and winning awards for their research at national meetings.\nThe strengths of our research programs in the areas of pediatric pulmonary and sleep medicine combined\nwith an enthusiastic faculty and a well-organized summer program provides an excellent opportunity to\nattract physician trainees at early and critical stages in their careers and increase the likelihood they will\nwant to further pursue research as physician- scientists.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nThe ultimate objective of this R03 proposal is to enable Dr. Ida Fonkoue to launch her independent research\ncareer by 1) expanding her current K01 research objectives; 2) providing additional support in her transition to\na future NIH R01 grant; and 3) generating sufficient preliminary results to support that R01 application. The\ncandidate\u2019s long-term goal is to build an NIH-funded research program in clinical and translational research in\nwomen\u2019s health, studying longitudinal derangements of vascular, neural and hormonal control, that contribute\nto the high rates of hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women living with chronic stress\nexposure such as those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder or panic\ndisorder. Over 7 million U.S. adults have PTSD, a disorder associated with a greater risk for hypertension and\nCVD. While healthy premenopausal women are relatively protected from CVD compared to men, a diagnosis\nof PTSD increases CVD risk in women by up to 3-fold. According to the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, over 60 million women in the United States are living with some form of heart disease.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying long-term CVD risk in women with PTSD is of paramount\nimportance to develop intervention strategies aiming at protecting the future health of this vulnerable\npopulation. Based on our preliminary data, the working hypothesis of this project is that: Over time, PTSD\nsignificantly inhibits nitric oxide bioavailability, resulting in accelerated autonomic and vascular dysfunctions in\npremenopausal women; and that these changes are exacerbated by low estradiol (E2) levels and sleep\ndisturbances. Aim 1 will measure longitudinal alterations in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity in\npremenopausal women with PTSD and determine the extent to which these alterations are a function of low E2\nlevels and low sleep efficiency at two years follow-up. Aim 2 will measure longitudinal alterations in vascular\nfunction in premenopausal women with PTSD and determine the extent to which these alterations are a\nfunction of low E2 levels and low sleep efficiency at two years follow-up. We will use gold-standard in vivo\nmeasures of sympathetic nerve activity (microneurography), endothelial (FMD) and vascular (applanation\ntonometry) function to study young, traumatized women with and without PTSD. The university of Minnesota\nUniversity, where the project will be completed, boasts an intellectually rich research environment whose\nresources will be used to carry out the proposed research, including an NIH-funded Clinical and Translational\nScience Institute (CTSI). During this R03 award, the PI will devote 75% effort to this project and her current\nK01 project. She recently achieved an important career-development milestone for her transition to full\nindependence by completing her Master of Science in Clinical Research. This research project, combined with\nfindings from her K01 and ongoing multidisciplinary mentorship, will help Dr. Fonkoue launch and sustain a\nmeritorious R01-funded independent research program.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Untangling the bidirectional relationship between the spread of pathological protein aggregates, sleep, and circadian clock disruption in neurodegenerative disease",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n Over 7 million Americans currently suffer from a neurodegenerative disease (NDD), including\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease and multiple system atrophy. In these disorders, intrinsically disordered proteins, including\ntau and \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), misfold into a prion-like conformation capable of self-templating and spreading\nthroughout the brain, causing progressive degeneration. Although age is the greatest known risk factor for the\nonset of NDDs, we urgently need to understand the mechanisms by which treatable risk factors contribute to\ndisease, including sleep and circadian clock disruption. It is well established that sleep disruption impairs\nautophagy, whereas promoting autophagy via small molecules, such as rapamycin, delays disease onset in\nanimal models of NDD. Given the growing literature identifying poor sleep quality and sleep disorders as both a\npreclinical sign and a symptom of NDDs, there is an increasing need to determine if protein misfolding leads to\nsleep and circadian desynchronization, if environmental circadian desynchronization (ECD) leads to protein\nmisfolding, or if both occur in a positive feedback loop that is mediated via impaired autophagic activity. The\nlong-term goal of our research is to understand the shared molecular mechanisms that contribute to the onset\nand progression of NDD. Our objective is to establish the mechanism(s) by which disrupted sleep and\ncircadian timing contribute to the formation and spread of pathogenic tau and \u03b1-syn in the brain. We\nhypothesize that the effects of circadian clock disruption on tau and \u03b1-syn spreading in NDD are mediated by\naltered autophagic activity in the brain. Rather than a linear signaling pathway, we anticipate that ECD sits atop\na positive feedback loop exacerbated by the presence of pathogenic protein in the brain. Our approach will\ninvestigate the bidirectional nature of this relationship. In Aim 1, we will investigate the effect of tau and \u03b1-syn\npropagation on sleep and circadian rhythms, and will determine if enhancing autophagy can slow these effects.\nIn Aim 2, we will interrogate the effect of circadian clock manipulation on the onset and progression of NDD.\nWe will also determine if ECD impairs autophagic activity to accelerate protein misfolding in the brain. While\nepidemiological and experimental studies have shown a clear interaction between circadian rhythms and\nNDDs, the nature of that relationship remains unclear. Successful completion of the proposed studies will\ndetermine if NDD drives circadian and sleep disruption, if ECD can drive NDD, and/or if the two exacerbate\none another through a positive feedback loop. Notably, because this proposal draws on Dr. Woerman\u2019s\nexpertise in tau and \u03b1-syn misfolding in NDD and Dr. Karatsoreos\u2019 expertise in circadian clock regulation of\nbrain function, we are uniquely positioned as a multi-PI team to address this important question.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Physiological and Behavioral Basis of Circadian Rhythm Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nDelayed Sleep Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD) is a common circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder that is\ncharacterized by difficulty in initiating sleep at night and subsequent difficulty in waking at times required for work\nor school. Consequently, DSWPD is often associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, reduced academic and\nwork performance, mood disturbances and reduced quality of life. Considering the significant negative impact of\nDSWPD on sleep quality, performance, mental and physical health and well-being, the physiological basis of the\ndisorder surprisingly remains unclear. Classically, DSWPD is assumed to stem from a delay of central circadian\ntiming. However, recent evidence shows that those clinically diagnosed with DSWPD fall into at least two distinct\nphenotypes: those with delayed circadian timing and sleep (DSWPD1) and those with typical circadian timing\nbut delayed sleep (DSWPD2). Using pupillometry, our group has shown differences in light sensitivity between\nthe DSWPD1 and DSWPD2 subtypes, as well as within the DSWPD1 group (high (HLS) and low sensitivity to\nlight (LLS)), indicating that clinically diagnosed DSWPD likely represents a complex interplay between underlying\nphysiological differences and behaviors that can affect sleep timing. However, current diagnostic criteria do not\nconsider these distinct phenotypes, which can limit diagnostic accuracy and hinder the development of\npersonalized treatments that target the underlying alterations in physiology and behavior of these DSWPD\nsubtypes. The overall goal of the proposed research is to identify the physiological basis of DSWPD subtypes,\nand to use these findings to inform development of mechanistically based approaches in circadian medicine.\nThis project will enroll 220 patients with DSWPD who will undergo circadian physiological and behavioral\nphenotyping by actigraphy, dim light melatonin sampling, pupillary light sensitivity, as well as assessment of\nmood, alertness and meal timing using questionnaires. In addition, we will evaluate light sensitivity in LLS\nDSWPD1, as measured by the suppression of melatonin, and test whether the SSRI citalopram can enhance\nlight sensitivity. Finally, mathematical modeling will be used to integrate physiological (pupillometry) and\nbehavioral assessments to identify DSWPD subtypes. The proposed research will form the basis for the\ndevelopment of light sensitivity-based tools and algorithms that integrate physiological and behavioral\nbiomarkers which can lead to a personalized multimodal approach for the care of patients with circadian rhythm\ndisorders.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n PGXL Technologies is developing a patented, non-invasive urine-based assay for obstructive sleep\napnea (OSA) in children. OSA occurs in up to 3% of children and as much as 10% of the pediatric orthodontic\npopulation. OSA can lead to disturbed sleep, neurobehavioral problems, neurocognitive impairments, and\nhypertension in children. Diagnosis is primarily limited to in-clinic sleep studies because patient history and\nphysical examinations are not adequately able to differentiate OSA from primary snoring (PS), i.e., snoring\nwithout associated sleep apnea or underlying sleep disorder. Polysomnography (PSG) tests are the gold\nstandard for diagnosis, but they are highly expensive, require an overnight stay in a supervised sleep clinic, are\ndifficult for children, and do not meet the need for screening OSA. There are several home sleep tests (HSTs)\nthat have been cleared for use in children that use similar sensors and methods as PSG studies in the home,\nbut the Academy of Sleep Medicine currently does not recommend the use of HSTs for diagnosis of OSA in\nchildren due to the lack of physician supervision and a lack of sufficient evidence of efficacy. There is an unmet\nneed for a rapid and sensitive test for OSA that can be used for potential diagnosis, patient monitoring as they\nundergo treatment, and screening of broader populations. PGXL Technologies is advancing development of a\nurine-based, multiplexed immunoassay for screening children for OSA. The four biomarkers urocortin-3\n(UCN3), kallikrein-1, orosomucoid-1, and uromodulin are present in urine and have previously shown high\nsensitivity and specificity for detection of OSA in children using ELISA assays. Prior to this project, PGXL has\nadapted two of the four biomarkers to the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform, a clinical diagnostic platform\nbased on a highly sensitive electrochemiluminescent detection approach. PGXL has demonstrated initial\nclinically relevant detection for two biomarkers, and acquired a retrospective set of pediatric urine samples that\ncan be used to determine reference ranges. The goal of this Fast-Track proposal will be to advance\ndevelopment through initial clinical validation. In Phase I, of this Fast-Track project, PGXL will integrate\nimmunoassays for the remaining biomarkers and optimize the analytical range for each of the assays in the\nUroMarker panel using pediatric urine specimens. In Phase II, PGXL will complete analytical validation\nrequired to meet CLIA requirements and conduct a prospective study to establish clinical cutoffs for an\nalgorithm that includes all four biomarkers. PGXL will also develop a prototype urine collection kit that can be\nused for urine collection at home and mailed to a CLIA lab for analysis. Success with these goals will also\ninform a larger multi-site clinical study that is expected in Phase IIb and will support FDA clearance of the test.\nThese milestones provide a path toward the commercial deployment of a high-throughput, multiplex test for\nrapid OSA screening through simple home-based sample collection to improve patient outcomes.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "BREATH: Breakthrough Research in Electromyography for the Assessment of Sleep-disordered BreaTHing",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary Abstract\nObjectives and Specific Aims: The overarching objective is to develop and validate a diagnostic tool for\nobstructive sleep apnea (OSA), Deep Learning-enhanced Transmembranous Electromyography (DL-tmEMG),\nto enable convenient point-of-care, and accurate detection of OSA for widespread use by any practitioner\nevaluating patients for OSA. In phase 1, this proposal aims to establish feasibility of tmEMG to diagnose OSA\npatients with good accuracy and to optimize the DL algorithm. Phase 2 aims to demonstrate generalizability\nand accuracy of DL-tmEMG in a diverse population, identifying differences in important subpopulations and the\nbenefits of multimodal data integration, while progressing regulatory approval.\nHealth-relatedness: This project addresses the urgent need for efficient and accurate diagnostics for OSA, a\nwidespread and serious disorder impacting an estimated 1 billion people worldwide, while undiagnosed OSA\ncosts the U.S. approximately $149.6 billion annually. Successful development of DL-tmEMG will enhance\npersonalized OSA management and improve healthcare accessibility. Efficient screening for OSA in under-\nresourced areas and for patients pre-surgically and perinatally are relevant to this proposal.\nDesign: Phase 1 Study#1 (9 months) is a case-control observational feasibility study of 60 adult patients.\nPhase 2 Study #2 (18 months) involves a large single center prospective observational cohort study of 200\nadult patients referred for PSG testing at the UCSD Sleep Center.\nMethods: DL-tmEMG is a new diagnostic that incorporates two novel technologies: 1) a non-invasive\ntransmembranous sensor of muscle activity (tmEMG), and 2) deep learning algorithms applied to EMG signal\nto provide an automatic interpretation (EMGNet). The combination of these two innovations obviates the need\nfor an expert electromyographer, key to allowing for widespread use to fulfill the unmet need for improved\ndiagnostics in OSA. In Phase 1 Study #1, 30 healthy and 30 patients with moderate to severe OSA will\nundergo DL-tmEMG within 30 days of polysomnography. We will compare DL-tmEMG classification results\nwith PSG results and calculate performance metrics. Phase 2 Study #2 utilizes a similar methodology as\nStudy #1 but differs in size as well as population pretest probabilities, being a cohort study design.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAdolescent mental health has worsened over the last decade and increased time spent on social media is often\ncited as a contributing factor. Parents, policymakers, and educators are being told to curb social media use.\nHowever, whether restricting or changing exposure to social media use will impact mental health is largely\nunknown. This research builds on our previous prospective, longitudinal, and intensive study of a population\nrepresentative sample of young adolescents. Mental health symptoms and social media use will be captured at\nthe daily, weekly, and yearly levels via ecological momentary assessment (EMA), passive sensing, wearable\ntechnologies, and a new youth co-created open application program interface (API) toolkit. Social media\nengagement will be captured via real time assessments alongside the extraction of social media histories via a\nyouth co-created API toolkit. A large representative sample of 2500 11- to 15-year-olds will be followed over four\nyears, with a subset of 750 adolescents followed intensively via EMA to experimentally test whether social media\nrestriction versus scaffolding (a) modifies social media engagement and (b) impacts mental health symptoms in\nthe moment, across days, and over years. Early adolescence is a key period for testing bi-directional associations\nbetween social media use and mental health given the onset of common and costly mental disorders like anxiety\nand depression, evidence of heightened response to interventions, and the fact that young people begin to\nnavigate online spaces independently at this time. The study is positioned to impact on science, practice, and\npolicy by (1) advancing discovery related to differential bi-directional influences between social media and mental\nhealth, (2) testing whether experimental modifications to social media-engagement impact same day and future\nmental health symptoms, (3) identifying subgroups of adolescents for which bi-directional linkages and/or\nintervention impacts may be amplified, and (4) creating a novel resource for the field that will allow adolescents\nto access, control, and share their digital trace data to advance research, interventions, and policy.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Summary\nChronic pain is a major health burden associated with immense economic and social costs. Predictive\nbiomarkers that can identify individuals at risk of developing severe and persistent pain, which is associated with\nworse disability and greater reliance on opioids, would promote aggressive, early intervention that could halt the\ntransition to chronic pain. Our team has uncovered evidence of a unique cortical biomarker signature that predicts\npain susceptibility (severity and duration). The biomarker signature combines resting state sensorimotor peak\nalpha frequency (PAF) measured using electroencephalograph (EEG) and corticomotor excitability (CME)\nmeasured using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This PAF/CME biomarker signature could be capable\nof predicting the severity of pain experienced by an individual minutes to months in the future, as well as the\nduration of pain (time to recovery). In the R61 phase of the current proposal, we aim to undertake analytical\nvalidation of this biomarker in healthy participants using a standardized model of the transition to sustained\nmyofascial temporomandibular pain (masseter intramuscular injection of nerve growth factor, n=150). We will\nrecord PAF/CME at multiple time points before and during the development of pain and use online diaries and\nin-laboratory assessments of pain, sleep, stress, and other psychosocial variables. Specifically, we will test if the\nbiomarker signature predicts an individual's pain sensitivity (high- or low-pain sensitive) with at least 75%\naccuracy. We will also test whether the biomarker signature predicts pain severity (on a 0-10 scale) and pain\nduration (number of days until pain resolves). We will use multiple statistical approaches to optimize and test the\nperformance of the predictive biomarker. In the R33 phase we then aim to perform initial clinical validation to\ndetermine whether the optimized PAF/CME biomarker signature predicts pain severity and duration in patients\nwith new onset myofascial temporomandibular disorder (TMD; n=30). We expect our work to result in the delivery\nof a candidate biomarker signature ready for advanced prospective clinical validation studies.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY \u2013 Skipping the hospital: Acute hospital care at home for people living with dementia\n In 2020, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) affected 5.8 million Americans and\nrepresented the fastest growing segment of our population.1 It was the sixth leading cause of death in the US;\n1 in 3 older adults died of ADRD; and cost of care was $305 billion. A constant for people living with dementia\n(PLWD) is hospitalization: PLWD are hospitalized at twice the rate as older adults without ADRD.2,3 Well-\ndocumented is the harm of hospitalization: 1 in 3 will lose functional status; 1 in 5 will become delirious.4,5 The\nharm of hospitalization is magnified in PLWD: they have 5 times the odds of an adverse event.6,7\n Acute hospital care at home (AHCaH) was specifically developed as a substitutive delivery model to\nhelp avoid these common harms for older adults while receiving the care that they need at home. The\ncurrent model provides hospital-level care in the home after presenting to the emergency department (ED) with\nan acute illness such as infection or heart failure. AHCaH includes twice daily in-home nurse visits, daily\nphysician visits, physical and occupational therapy, intravenous medications, biometric monitoring, in-home\ndiagnostics, home health aide care, and 24/7 response. Serious illness conversations (SICs) at home for\napplicable patients are essential for setting goals of care and ideal given the home environment. Prior studies\nincluding several randomized controlled trials demonstrated significant improvements in 30-day readmission,\nsafety, and cost.8\u201315 The impact on family caregivers and clinicians caring for PLWD is understudied. The\nmechanism of action for home hospital is patients are more physically active, sleep better, have more days at\nhome in a familiar environment with improved locus of control and experience, and have less hospital-acquired\ndisability.\u201d16 Home hospital care is now approved at over 296 hospitals in 37 states.\n There exists a critical need to better serve PLWD and their family caregivers when they become acutely ill.\nDespite its focus on older adults, few home hospital efforts specifically target PLWD and may decline such\npatients due to insufficient family caregiver support in the home, perceived risk of caring for PLWD in the\nhome, and lack of clear goals of care. We propose a 3-part PLWD-specific year-long pre-enrolled AHCaH\npathway: 1) in-home SIC and caregiver resourcing; 2) video and in-home acute illness evaluation on demand\nincluding mobile integrated health paramedic and home health aide; and 3) as needed and as appropriate\nAHCaH with additional ADRD resources including home health aide care and delirium prevention measures.\nOur overarching aim is to implement and evaluate (NIH Stage III) an AHCaH pathway specifically for\nPLWD that will serve as a national model. We will evaluate in a randomized controlled trial the effect of a pre-\nenrollment AHCaH pathway on quality of life over 12 months for persons with moderate to severe dementia\n(Aim 1). We will evaluate the experiences of family caregivers using a mixed-methods approach (quantitative\nand qualitative) in both pre-enrolled home hospital and usual care (Aim 2).",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nPerinatal depression (PND), defined as depression during pregnancy and up to one year postpartum, affects\nmore than 20% of pregnancies and disproportionately impacts Black Women and Latinas. PND increases risk\nof preterm birth and infant neurodevelopment deficits. Yet we still do not fully understand the pathobiology of\nPND, which limits efforts to improve its prevention, identification and treatment. Interactions between the host\nand microbial communities that reside in the gut are essential for human health. Gut microorganisms play an\nimportant role in producing beneficial metabolites, including the neurotransmitters serotonin and gamma-\naminobutyric acid (GABA). The gut microbiota bidirectionally communicate with the brain, an interaction\nmediated by the neurological, immune, and endocrine systems and coined as the microbiota-gut-brain axis\n(MGBA). Our initial pilot results from a longitudinal study of low-income women of color (n=42) early in pregnancy,\nwhich showed that multiple attributes of the MGBA were associated with depressive symptom severity, including\nproduction of short chain fatty-acids, metabolism of tryptophan and GABA, and systemic inflammation mediated\nby bile acid metabolism. Although our initial data points to new MGBA signatures linked to depressive symptom\nseverity in the first and second trimesters, additional work is needed to determine whether these signatures and\ntheir interactions extend beyond the second trimester. Further, microbial metabolism is driven both by the\ninteractions between metabolites and by the interplay between microbial metabolic systems with maternal\ninflammatory system and metabolism. Thus, determining the causal influence of these new MGBA signatures\non depressive symptom severity during the perinatal period requires using approaches that can establish the\neffect of systems (networks) coupling in MGBA functioning. Here, we propose a clinical translational study to\ndetermine the role of MGBA in PND by using a systems biology framework and an experimental animal model\nto assess causality. To test this, we will draw from our research infrastructure to recruit 158 women (55% Black,\n30% Latina) early in pregnancy (<16 gestational weeks) and follow them bimonthly for up to 6 weeks postpartum.\nWe will assess mood; lifestyle (diet, physical activity, sleep); and heart-rate variability (a proxy for stress) and\nwill measure microbial genome and meta-metabolome and maternal blood transcriptome and metabolome. In\nAim 1, we will employ interpretable machine learning models to predict depressive symptom severity\nconcurrently and prospectively. In Aim 2, we will establish coupling mechanisms that regulate symptom severity\nby modeling the interplay between microbial and maternal metabolic, genetic and regulatory systems using\nnetwork theory. In Aim 3, we will determine the causal role of gut microbiota in symptom severity in a female\npregnant germ-free mouse model using fecal microbiota transplants. Our paradigm-shifting data-driven proposal\nwill identify host-microbial features predictive of perinatal depressive symptom severity and modifiable risk\nfactors for prevention and treatment of PND, with causality tested in animal models.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nBlack and Hispanic men are at highest risk of comorbid conditions resulting from HIV. Cardiovascular disease has become the leading contributor to mortality among persons with HIV, as both conditions are often co-morbid. As a result, prominent HIV comorbid conditions include CVD, high blood pressure and type II diabetes mellitus. Compared with the general population, CVD risk is 1.5 to 2 times higher in people with HIV, and this risk increases with age. By the year 2030, an estimated 78% of persons with HIV will be 50 years old or older, and nearly 80% will have one or more chronic conditions. These overlapping health needs drive up the cost of care as total direct expenditures for HIV treatment in the US exceed those for persons without HIV by approximately $10.7 billion and cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities further increase this financial burden. Increased risk of HIV-related comorbidities, such as heart disease, is driven by environmental and interpersonal factors that contribute to nicotine exposure, poor diet quality, low physical activity, insufficient sleep, high cholesterol levels, elevated blood pressure, high blood sugar, and increased body mass index. Even when HIV viral load is well-controlled, HIV-infection causes immune activation and chronic inflammation, which can cause a narrowing of blood vessels, and can result in high blood pressure, chest pain, and/or buildup of plaque in the heart, ultimately resulting in heart disease. The status quo as it pertains to traditional chronic illness prevention has been conventional patient teaching in the clinical setting. However, prevention efforts to reduce heart disease have not achieved population-level impact and have been less effective among persons with HIV. The LEARN Study was a pilot waitlist control trial testing a virtual environment for CVD and metabolic disease prevention education. Our LEARN findings suggested that participants are concerned about hypertension, type II diabetes, stroke, and cancer. Cancer risk reflected both the increased incidence of non\u2013AIDS-defining malignancies among people with HIV and shared risk factors for cardiovascular comorbidities. We propose a follow-up study to these findings in LEARN 2 using innovative clinical and community collaboration, a multidisciplinary team, and a virtual environment designed to preemptively mitigate HIV\u2010related comorbidities with shared risk factors. Project objectives are to: 1) to utilize formative research to modify our intervention to address contextual factors that affect prevention of shared clinical risk factors for HIV\u2010comorbidities; 2) determine the efficacy of LEARN2, as prevention education for HIV-comorbidities; and 3) conduct a process evaluation of LEARN2 feasibility and acceptability, identifying which components are most successful in initiating change.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAlthough lifestyle factors have been investigated for their potential to modify risk of adverse pregnancy\noutcomes, initiating interventions during pregnancy may not have the greatest impact. Therefore, it is crucial to\nfocus on preconception interventions to support healthy placental development and reduce the risk of\nmetabolic conditions. However, there is a lack of data regarding the optimal timing and strategies for\npreconception health to improve pregnancy outcomes. Physical activity, diet, and sleep play pivotal roles in\npreconception care as they influence metabolic health and body weight regulation, which can impact the\nsubsequent risk of pregnancy complications. Existing preconception care often emphasizes weight loss, but\nthere is limited evidence on the most effective amounts and strategies for improving later pregnancy health.\nMoreover, using body mass index as the primary measure for obesity classification may misidentify individuals\nwho would benefit the most from weight loss, as it fails to distinguish between lean mass, fat mass, and fat\ndistribution. Methodological challenges in studying preconception exposures have hindered the establishment\nof a robust evidence base for optimizing pregnancy health. To address these gaps, we propose an innovative\napproach utilizing the linkage between the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) and Medicaid data.\nWith this data examine pregnancy outcomes among low-income reproductive-aged women who become\npregnant and utilize Medicaid services following their NHANES assessment. Medicaid covers a substantial\nportion of U.S. births, making studies of Medicaid-covered pregnancies highly generalizable. Leveraging the\nNHANES-Medicaid data as a \"preconception cohort,\" we will investigate the impact of preconception\nexposures on pregnancy outcomes. Employing advanced epidemiological methods to minimize selection bias\nand improve generalizability, we will apply a target trial framework to assess preconception strategies for\noptimizing pregnancy outcomes. The comprehensive phenotyping data available in NHANES will enable robust\nassessment of confounding variables, reducing the impact of unmeasured confounders and mimicking\nrandomized trials of lifestyle factors. Using NHANES-assessed exposures, we will evaluate the influence of\npreconception dietary patterns, physical activity, sleep, body composition, and weight loss attempts and\nstrategies on adverse pregnancy outcomes. This analysis will provide the most extensive and generalizable\nevidence to date on preconception health and its impact on adverse pregnancy outcomes, ultimately informing\nthe development of evidence-based preconception care guidelines.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nAfrican Americans (AAs) have a high prevalence of hypertension and suffer a disproportionately\nhigh risk for cardiovascular disease compared to whites. Apparent treatment-resistant\nhypertension (aTRH) is a severe form of hypertension defined as requiring \u2265 4 antihypertensive\nmedications to achieve blood pressure (BP) control. An estimated 9 million US adults have\naTRH. Given the rigorous clinical work-up needed to rule out pseudoresistance and therefore,\ndiagnose true TRH, the population prevalence of TRH is not known. We propose an ancillary\nstudy to the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), a large prospective cohort of AA adults (n=5,306) that\nwill deeply phenotype participants with aTRH, ruling out pseudoresistance (i.e., inaccurate clinic\nBP measurement, presence of a white coat effect, suboptimal antihypertensive therapy, and\npoor medication adherence) and secondary causes of hypertension (i.e., primary aldosteronism,\nobstructive sleep apnea, and kidney disease). The JHS provides a highly feasible setting for\nthe proposed study as it includes a large population of AAs with a high prevalence of\nhypertension and extensive data collection as part of an upcoming fourth parent study visit,\nwhich will facilitate the screening and recruitment of participants for our ancillary study. Based\non data collected during the fourth JHS exam, we will identify 400 participants with aTRH and\n200 treatment-responsive controls. These participants will undergo a clinical evaluation for TRH\nincluding assessment of existing ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) data to detect white coat\neffect and urinalysis of antihypertensive drugs and metabolites to assess medication adherence.\nAlso, participants with aTRH will be compared to treatment responsive controls with respect to\nsecondary causes of hypertension and lifestyle factors. Clinical translation of the study findings\nwill be facilitated by an external panel of experts who co-authored the American Heart\nAssociation 2018 Scientific Statement on Resistant Hypertension. Overall, the diagnosis and\ntreatment of TRH is limited by our understanding of pseudoresistance and other factors\nunderlying aTRH. The proposed study is urgently needed to more efficiently diagnose and\nbetter treat this severe form of hypertension among African Americans.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Effect of support for low-income mothers of preterm infants on parental caregiving in the NICU",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nPreterm birth is the leading cause of childhood mortality and developmental disabilities and costs $26 billion\nannually. A critical modifier of preterm infant health and development is maternal presence during the birth\nhospitalization, which facilitates breast milk provision, participation in skin-to-skin care and allows mothers to\nbenefit from training in post-discharge infant care practices. However, these benefits can only be realized if\nmothers are able to visit their hospitalized preterm infants for several hours per day, actively engage in\ncaregiving and receive training from staff during the many weeks of a typical preterm birth hospitalization.\nRegularly visiting a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) requires mothers to shoulder significant costs, including\nparking, childcare for other children, transportation, and accommodations, in addition to forgoing income.\nMoreover, new evidence suggests that the psychological burden of financial strain may worsen mental health\noutcomes (including stress and depression) and impede cognitive functions such as attention, memory, and\ninhibitory control, which may further impede low-income mothers\u2019 participation in NICU caregiving. Building on\na feasibility trial conducted by our team, we propose to conduct a 1:1 randomized control trial to rigorously test\nthe impact of financial transfers versus standard of care (control) among 420 low-income mothers with infants\n25-33 weeks\u2019 gestation in 3 level 3 NICUs (1 urban, 1 urban/suburban and 1 suburban/rural). Mothers in the\nintervention arm will receive a transfer of $160 per hospital week with a one-time \u201clabel\u201d or scripted message\nthat explains that the transfer is intended for them to visit and care for their hospitalized infant. Our primary\nhypothesis is that financial transfers can enable economically disadvantaged families to visit the NICU, reduce\nthe negative psychological impacts of financial distress, increase maternal caregiving behaviors associated\nwith positive preterm infant health and development and potentially reduce health systems costs. In Aim 1, we\nwill examine the impact of financial transfers on primary NICU caregiving behaviors --breastmilk provision and\nskin-to-skin care-- and secondary 1-2 month post-discharge caregiving behaviors-- safe sleep practices. In Aim\n2, we will consider mechanisms of action, including mediators (NICU visitation, mental health, and cognitive\nfunction) of the relationship between financial transfers and caregiving behaviors of interest. We will also\nqualitatively explore maternal perspectives of financial transfers, mediators of its impact, and other barriers and\nfacilitators to maternal caregiving. In Aim 3, we will conduct exploratory analysis of cost drivers (length of stay,\n30-day readmission and ED use). This simple and scalable intervention has tremendous potential to improve\nequity in health care access by enabling key populations to utilize existing clinical supports during the NICU\nhospitalization.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\n The patterns of connectivity across the neural networks of the brain play a critical role in determining how\nthose networks function. However, the mechanisms through which the architecture of a circuit supports\ninformation encoding or storage remain unclear. In addition, circuit-level activity patterns drive changes in the\nstrength of synapses across that circuit, which in turn necessarily alters how the circuit behaves. While\nconsiderable work has elucidated many cellular and molecular components of synaptic plasticity, the precise\nreciprocal interaction between in vivo activity patterns, synaptic plasticity, and circuit level function remains\nunclear. The brain expresses several distinct types of internally generated sequences of neuronal activity\nindependent of external sensory stimuli, and such temporally precise, self-organized sequences play a crucial\nrole in information processing and memory formation/retrieval. Due to their independence from external inputs,\ninternally generated sequences serve as a powerful model to explore the fundamental relationship between the\nconnectome and network function. The hippocampus, a brain area critical for the formation of many types of\nmemory, generates a well-defined type of neuronal sequence, sharp-wave/ripple (SWR)-associated replay,\nwhich is observed during \u201coffline\u201d states such as rest or sleep. The central objectives of this proposal are to\nidentify the in vivo connectome architecture of the hippocampal network, quantify how these connection\npatterns regulate activity across the circuit during active \u201conline\u201d encoding and during \u201coffline\u201d SWR\nsequences, measure how in vivo activity patterns across this neural network change the weights of synaptic\nconnections, and establish how those synaptic changes in turn impact circuit function. Supported by\nconsiderable preliminary data, these ambitious aims will be achieved through a combination of ultra-high\ndensity, large-scale in vivo electrophysiology followed by in-depth computational analysis of the resulting data,\nand rapid in vivo optical labeling of active neural populations followed by ex vivo physiological quantification of\nsynaptic function. In Aim 1, we will directly test two models with differing predictions regarding the impact of\nlocal hippocampal connectivity on place field distribution and activity patterns during SWRs. In Aim 2, we will\ntest the hypothesis that coordinated activity of synaptically connected neuron pairs during behavior (e.g.,\noverlapping place fields) potentiates their synaptic connections, which in turn impacts the content of\nsubsequent SWRs. In Aim 3, we will directly quantify the synaptic consequences of in vivo activity via whole\ncell electrophysiology performed in neurons which were either active or silent in an immediately prior\nexperience. Together, this study is expected to meaningfully advance our understanding of circuit-level brain\nfunction by revealing the fundamental principles which allow precise patterns of activity to be dynamically\ngenerated and propagated throughout the hippocampal network in support of learning.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Healthcare workers represent a large and growing segment of the US workforce, and the strain of the COVID-\n19 pandemic on the healthcare system has brought to light the significant stress, trauma, and burnout that\nhealthcare workers experience. These experiences may have lasting effects on healthcare workers\u2019 substance\nuse, mental health symptomatology, and suicidality, particularly among those in lower-wage occupations. These\nworkers often have fewer supports and resources, less autonomy in the workplace (e.g., scheduling/hours\nworked, workload), and experience greater occupational hazards than their higher-earning counterparts yet\nremain highly understudied. Most of the published studies related to substance use, mental health\nsymptomatology, and suicidality among healthcare workers have disproportionately focused on physicians and\nother high-wage healthcare occupations. The objective of the proposed research is to examine the social and\nenvironmental influences on the substance use, mental health symptomatology, and suicidality of non-\nprescriber/non-executive healthcare workers over time, with particular attention to the effects of moral injury (i.e.,\npsychosocial and behavioral impacts of \u201cfailing to prevent or bearing witness to acts that transgress deeply held\nmoral beliefs and expectations\u201d) and workplace policies, programs, and practices. The rationale for the proposed\nresearch is that identification of factors beyond the individual level that confer risk or protection to healthcare\nworkers\u2019 substance use, mental health symptomatology, and suicidality can inform the development of more\neffective prevention and intervention efforts, particularly as it relates to the implementation of psychosocially safe\nand healthy workplace practices. Individual-level explanations for people\u2019s risk and resilience to substance use,\nmental health symptomatology, and suicidality remain dominant in the scientific literature. However, we will also\nfocus on interpersonal, organizational, community, and societal factors \u2013 and their intersections with\nsocioeconomic positioning \u2013 that affect the health, well-being, and risk for substance use, substance-related\nharms, and substance use disorders among healthcare workers. This research proposes to 1) examine the\neffects of moral injury on changes in substance use, substance use disorders, problematic mental health\nsymptomatology, and suicidality; 2) examine the impact of other individual, social, and environmental factors on\nthese outcomes over time; and 3) examine the unique impacts of workplace policies, programs, and practices\non the risk and resilience of healthcare workers. We will pursue these aims using an innovative approach and\nunique focus. The proposed research will examine a diverse sample of healthcare workers recruited via social\nmedia, including low-wage healthcare support occupations (e.g., nursing assistants, dietary aides, custodians).\nThe proposed research is significant because the examination of factors external to the individual will identify\nmodifiable social and environmental risk factors that are more efficient and effective intervention targets, given\nthe broad impacts of population-level interventions.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nKnee osteoarthritis is a very common and debilitating condition, affecting >14 million Americans. Many people\nwith knee osteoarthritis require total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to treat pain and improve function, and opioids\nremain the primary modality for treatment of pain after TKA. However, opioids carry significant side effects,\nwith ~80% of surgical patients reporting at least one moderate or severe side effect (e.g. nausea, dizziness,\nconstipation). Moreover, perioperative opioid exposure is associated with patients becoming dependent on\nopioids long after surgical recovery, and new chronic opioid dependence is subsequently associated with\nincreased healthcare costs, the development of opioid use disorder (addiction), overdose, and death. Hence,\nresearch into opioid alternatives for postoperative pain is of critical importance. Cannabinoids,\nincluding\ncannabidiol (CBD), are one class of potential opioid-sparing pain medications. While CBD is used by an\nestimated 14% of the general public, most frequently for chronic pain and related symptoms (including as an\nopioid substitute), rigorous clinical research on CBD is limited. CBD shows great promise, as it is non-\nintoxicating, and reduces pain, anxiety and inflammation in animal studies. Previous research has found that\nCBD reduced opioid craving and anxiety, which further suggests it may decrease opioid use after surgery. It is\nalso well tolerated across numerous medical conditions. Moreover, CBD (Epidiolex\uf0e2), the study drug we will\nuse, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating some seizure disorders, and it is not subject\nto the same regulatory restrictions as\n\u0394\n-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In this study, we will recruit 380 patients\nundergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) from two large health systems. In this multi-site, 2x2 factorial,\ndouble-blind, randomized controlled trial, participants will receive one of four combinations of placebo or CBD\n(300 mg/day) for one week prior to surgery together with CBD or placebo for 4 weeks following surgery. Our\nprimary outcome will be post-operative opioid consumption in the 4-week period following surgery. The study\ndesign will also allow us to investigate and untangle CBD's pre- and post-surgical effects, including reduction\nof anxiety, sleep disturbance and inflammation. We will also conduct detailed investigations of the side effects\nand adverse events, as well as pharmacokinetics of CBD throughout the treatment course. The successful\ncompletion of this study will give much needed evidence for the role of CBD as an opioid-sparing medication\nfor pain after surgery. Given that there are more than 50 million surgeries each year in the United States, these\nfindings could have much broader implications beyond TKA and would motivate important new lines of\nresearch into the role of CBD.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nPotassium (K+) channels are major determinants of cell excitability and play crucial roles in physiological\nprocesses. Large conductance and Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels, have the ability to couple intracellular\nCa2+ to membrane potential variations, play major physiological roles in vascular smooth muscle tone\nmaintenance, regulation of circadian rhythms, hearing, neurotransmitter release. BK channels can associate\nwith tissue-specific accessory subunits, endowing the channels with different functional properties. b2 and b3\nsubunits induce N-type (or ball-and-chain) inactivation of the otherwise non-inactivating BK channels. BK\nchannel dysfunction has been associated with many pathophysiological conditions, so understanding how they\ngate can have major therapeutic consequences. In the previous grant cycle, we determined the structural\ncorrelates of gating and ball-and-chain inactivation in K+ channels, using a prokaryotic homolog of BK\nchannels, MthK, from Methanotropicum thermoautotrophicum. We also found that lipid bilayer thickness\nstrongly affects MthK inactivation. Unlike BK, MthK channels inactivate using an intrinsic N-terminal \u201cball\u201d\ndomain, similar to Shaker K+ channels. The overall objective of this grant is to determine the structural\ncorrelates of ball-and-chain inactivation in BK channels and understand how lipids modulate inactivation in\nboth MthK and BK. Since membrane lipid composition cannot be controlled in cells, we will use a bottom-up\napproach of purified channels in reconstituted systems to rigorously control lipid composition. We will use\nstructural, functional, and computational analysis (the last with a collaborator, see letter) on both MthK and BK\nchannels to reach these goals. Our first aim is to determine the mechanism by which lipids modulate ball-and-\nchain inactivation in MthK. Our hypothesis, predicted by MD simulations, is that thicker bilayers bind the\namphipathic ball domain better than thinner bilayers, which will be tested with mutagenesis of the ball domain,\nconstructs with different chain lengths, and membrane manipulations. This aim was proposed in the previous\ngrant cycle, we made considerable progress but the mechanism was more complex than anticipated. Hence,\nthis aim still needs investigation. During the last cycle, we also treated another unexpected finding from the\nstructure of closed MthK, still in the scope of the grant but not explicitly proposed, which was just published.\nOur second aim is to determine the structural correlates of ball-and-chain inactivation in BK channels as well\nas how bilayer-thickness and other bilayer properties modulate these channels. We will use b2 and a chimeric\nb4-b2 subunit for both structural studies and electrophysiology in HEK cells and liposomes. We will investigate\nlipid-dependence of BK channel gating with and without b subunits with stopped-flow assays and single-\nchannel recordings of purified BK channels reconstituted in liposomes. Channel structures in complex with\nlipids will be solved using cryo-EM. The accomplishment of these aims will provide a comprehensive picture of\nball-and-chain inactivation and lipid modulation in calcium-gated potassium channels.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nOpioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic and relapsing brain disease that is characterized by loss of control over\nopioid use. It affects over 2 million Americans and causes one overdose death every 20-minutes. Despite\neffective evidence-based treatments in the form of both behavioral interventions and FDA-approved medication\nfor addiction treatment (MAT), relapse rates are high and are associated with lack of retention in treatment and\na continued cycle of illicit opioid use. Further research is urgently needed to better understand the mechanisms\nthat contribute to ongoing illicit opioid use and poor retention in MAT and identify novel treatments. In response\nto RFA-HL-19-029 and its call to conduct \u201cmechanistic studies to determine the directionality of sleep and OUD\ninteractions in humans\u2026 and to identify new opportunities for prevention and improved therapy,\u201d The\nCollaboration Linking Opioid Use Disorder and Sleep (\u201cCLOUDS\u201d) Study will investigate patients on MAT to\nelucidate potential causal mechanisms between sleep deficiency and OUD. We will conduct an observational\ncohort study of N= 220 patients with OUD who were recently stabilized on MAT at a large opioid treatment\nprogram in New Haven, CT. At baseline, all patients will undergo: (1) comprehensive assessments of sleep and\ncircadian rhythmicity (i.e., polysomnography, melatonin onset/offset, wrist actigraphy, and validated sleep and\ncircadian surveys); (2) a task-enriched functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) functional connectivity\nprotocol; (3) blood assays for measures of stress and sex hormones; (4) neuro-clinical status using validated\ninterviews, and surveys; and (5) physical home microenvironment and psychosocial family assessments.\nPatients will be followed for 6 months for the primary outcome of % days of illicit opioid use. In this context, we\nwill pursue several specific aims. Aim1: Using fMRI network analyses, test whether there are different\nneurocognitive connectivity patterns between patients with adequate vs. deficient sleep in brain systems involved\nin addiction (e.g., executive function, reward processing) and assess the extent to which these \u201cneural\nfingerprints\u201d predict ongoing opioid use. Aim 2: Evaluate the potential biologic, psychiatric, and pharmacologic\nmechanisms that explain the causal pathway between sleep deficiency and opioid use by analyzing the\nmediating effect of other selected known OUD risk factors including stress, pain, negative affect, and other\nsubstance use. Aim 3: Test the extent to which ecologic factors such as psychosocial, family, and neighborhood\ncontextual factors associated with OUD contribute to sleep deficiency among patients in MAT. An experienced\nmultidisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in Sleep and Circadian Medicine, Biomedical Imaging,\nPsychiatry, Addiction Medicine, Nursing, and Psychology will conduct this research. This proposal will fulfill a\ncritical step towards identifying novel sleep and circadian-focused treatment approaches that may lead to\nimproved outcomes for patients with OUD.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "CRCNS: Mechanisms and consequences of infraslow oscillations in sleep",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "During sleep, the mammalian brain alternates between two major brain states, rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM\n(NREM) sleep. Recent work showed that the electroencephalogram (EEG) during NREM sleep in both\nhumans and mice exhibits a pronounced infraslow (~50s) modulation in the sigma (10-15 Hz) power range Transitions\nfrom NREM to REM sleep and spontaneous awakenings are synchronized with this infraslow o power (ISP) rhythm,\nsuggesting that it plays a crucial role in shaping sleep architecture and influencing sleep quality. Yet, the\nmechanisms underlying the generation of infraslow rhythms remain largely unknown. Importantly, the ISP rhythm\nalso strongly modulates the activity of neurons in REM sleep-regulatory brain areas including the locus coeruleus\n(LC), dorsomedial medulla (dmM), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and dorsal raphe (DR). However, current models of\nsleep regulation lack this prominent infraslow rhythm, and a functional understanding of its impacts on sleep\narchitecture therefore remains elusive. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the dmM controls the ISP\nrhythm through its interactions with the LC and that infraslow fluctuations in the activity of DR/PAG neurons control\nthe stability of NREM sleep and consequently gate transitions to REM sleep. The specific aims combine\nexperimental studies and biophysical computational modeling to determine mechanisms governing the ISP rhythm,\nand to understand the consequences of this rhythm on sleep architecture, particularly NREM--+REM transitions. In\nAIM 1, we will perform Neuropixels recordings along with optogenetic manipulation to identify how network\ninteractions between dmM and LC neurons regulate the ISP rhythm In parallel, we will develop computational\nmodels informed by recorded data to identify underlying mechanisms of infraslow rhythm generation in the dmM-LC\ncircuit In AIM 2 we will conduct Neuropixels recordings to identify the functional connectivity among different\nsubclasses of DR/PAG neurons. By optogenetically blocking external infraslow inputs to the DR/PAG and\nconducting behavioral REM sleep deprivation, we will probe how the infraslow rhythmicity and REM sleep pressure\naffect the dynamics in the DR/PAG network and state transitions. In parallel, we will construct computational models\ninformed by the recorded data to identify the dynamic interactions among different DR/PAG neuron subclasses and\nto analyze the effects of infraslow activity and REM sleep pressure on simulated sleep architecture. Our studies will\nbridge a fundamental gap in our understanding of how the mammalian brain generates infraslow\nrhythms. Furthermore, results will identify targets for enhancing the ISP rhythm to test its impact on sleep quality,\nand will lay the groundwork to develop complementary and integrative health approaches to leverage infraslow brain\ndynamics to promote healthy sleep and thus physiological and emotional well-being.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nIn response to RFA-DA-21-116, \u201cMood Disorders in People Living with HIV: Mechanisms and Pathways\u201d,\nwe\npropose to investigate neuroimmunological and reward functions to study comorbid depression in women living\nwith HIV (WLWH), a group heavily impacted by depression and its health consequences, yet underrepresented\nin HIV research. The proposed research will build upon the established Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study\n(MACS)/Women\u2019s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) (Dr. Sharma, MPI of Bronx\nMWCCS) and its unique cohort of phenotypically well-characterized women with and without HIV. Our proposed\nmodel is: (1) HIV infection induces systemic inflammation (cytokines, kynurenines); (2) systemic inflammation\nextends to the CNS inducing oxidative stress [\u2193glutathione (GSH, antioxidant)] and gamma-aminobutyric acid\n(GABA, major inhibitory neurotransmitter) deficits; (3) such neurochemical changes alter the reward circuitry,\nwhich contribute to the high prevalence of depression in WLWH. In support of this model, our immunological\nwork in the WIHS found increased kynurenine pathway (KP) activity in WLWH compared to women without HIV,\nand among WLWH, KP activity was higher in WLWH with depression. In our depression non-HIV research, we\nfound that anhedonia\u2013a core symptom of depression reflecting reward deficits\u2013was associated with worse\ndepression outcomes, including chronicity and suicidality. To better delineate reward circuitry, we identified\ndistinct resting-state network features associated with depression and anhedonia using striatal-based intrinsic\nfunctional connectivity and whole-brain parcellation data-driven graph theory analysis. We additionally utilized\nthe reward flanker (RFT) and reward prediction error (RPET) fMRI tasks to examine distinct brain activity during\nreward anticipation, attainment, and prediction errors, which predicted future depression severity. Utilizing proton\nMR spectroscopy, we showed that anhedonia accounted for decreased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) GABA\nlevels in adolescent depression, and moreover, we documented inverse relationships between cortical GSH and\nanhedonia severity in depressed adults. Furthermore, we reported associations between circulatory cytokines\nand kynurenines with both anhedonia and reward neurocircuitry in youth. Extending our compelling findings, we\nwill now test the overall hypothesis that WLWH exhibit increased systemic and CNS inflammation, which leads\nto reward dysfunction and subsequently depression. We will utilize a 2\u00d72 factorial design: 1) 100 depressed\nWLWH; 2) 100 non-depressed WLWH; 3) 50 depressed HIV negative women; and 4) 50 non-depressed HIV-\nnegative women. Participants will have comprehensive evaluations at baseline, 6- and 12-months assessing\ndepression, reward, anxiety, trauma, HIV treatment, CD4+ count, and VL. F-MRI (resting-state, RFT, RPET), 1H\nMRS (GABA, GSH), a reward computerized task and cognitive tests will be done at baseline.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nCircadian rhythm and sleep disruptions are prevalent in nearly all psychiatry disorders including major\ndepression (MDD), bipolar disorder (BP), and schizophrenia (SZ). Each cell in the brain has its own molecular\nclock which regulates the rhythmic expression of many different genes, allowing cells to maximize efficiency at\ntimes of day in which they are most needed. Importantly, while the core clock does not change from cell to cell,\nthe genes that the clock regulates can be very different in each cell type and the timing in which genes peak can\nalso be highly variable, even with some cells having a completely opposite phases of gene expression. Previous\nstudies by our group and others have established that gene expression rhythms can be reliably measured in\nhuman postmortem brain and that molecular rhythms are highly irregular or disrupted in subjects with psychiatric\ndisease. In the first funding cycle, we assessed molecular rhythms in tissue homogenates taken from specific\ncortical and striatal regions in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BP),\nschizophrenia (SZ), or unaffected comparison subjects. Using mouse models, we also established that molecular\nrhythms in these regions are important in the regulation of behavior. We also found that particular rhythmic\nsignatures are associated with features like psychosis independent of clinical diagnosis. In this next funding\ncycle, we will dive deeper to determine the rhythmic signatures of individual cell types and how these work in\nharmony with others around them to synchronize the brain. We will also determine how these rhythms differ in\nsubjects with MDD, BP, and SZ. We will perform additional analysis to determine if clinical features across\ndiagnosis are related to specific rhythmic patterns and assess ultradian and seasonal rhythms. We will focus on\none particular circuit, the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) to nucleus accumbens (NAc), since this\ncircuit is known to be important in the regulation of reward-related decision making, mood, impulsivity, and\nmotivation and compare these regions to the motor cortex. To determine the functional relevance of these\nmolecular rhythm changes in specific cell types we will use mouse models with cell-type specific manipulations\nof the core molecular clock and rhythms in selected transcripts to determine the impact on both cellular activity\nand behavior. Taken together, these studies will extend and expand the results obtained during the first funding\ncycle to give us important insight into rhythm disruptions associated with major psychiatric disease.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Emergence of arm reaching behavior and lateralization of motor control in infancy",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "It is crucial to understand how infants learn to progress from spontaneous movements into goal-directed, refined\nmotor skills. Infant learning is the focus of early intervention programs, and the need for effective early\nintervention is great. Until we understand the mechanisms of development and what promotes or inhibits\nsuccessful infant learning, we cannot design optimal early intervention. Our specific objective is to longitudinally\nstudy infant experience (infant and environmental factors) and underlying neural substrates\n(electroencephalography (EEG)) as infants learn arm reaching, an early, foundational motor skill.\nCurrent theories suggest that infants learn through a repeated perception-action process and that experiencing\nerror is the key mechanism for successful infant learning. Thus, Aim 1 will measure error rate longitudinally\nacross the emergence and refinement of reaching. In Aim 1 we will determine the relationship between error rate\nand the development of reaching skill. We hypothesize that infants will demonstrate a high error rate\n(errors/attempts) near reaching onset that decreases as they refine the skill, supporting the idea that making\nerrors is a key experience in order for learning to occur. Aim 2 will focus on individual infant and environmental\nfactors that predict age of onset of reaching. In Aim 2 we will identify infant and environmental factors related to\nthe age of reaching onset. Infant factors are motor experience (amount and type (unilateral or bilateral) of daily\narm movement experience) and cognitive development status. Environmental factors are level of maternal\neducation, quality of caregiver-infant interactions, nutrition, and sleep. We hypothesize that these factors are\nrelated to the age at which infants are observed to begin to reach, and we will determine the strength of the\nassociations and characteristics of infants reaching at different ages. The results will identify targets for\nintervention that are most likely to be successful. Aim 3 will use EEG to determine how brain function changes\nas reaching is refined from an unstable skill to a successful, lateralized (typically right arm preference) movement.\nUsing EEG will allow us to collect data in the home, both resting state and during arm movements. In Aim 3 we\nwill identify patterns of concurrent brain activity that differentiate between spontaneous arm movements, early\nreaching attempts, and skilled reaches in infants with typical development. Based on our pilot data, we\nhypothesize that frontal-parietal connectivity increases, interhemispheric connectivity decreases, and sources of\nEEG activity shift from bilateral to unilateral as reaches become more goal directed, successful, and lateralized.\nAims 1\u20133 focus on infants with typical development; exploratory Aim 4 contrasts our findings with a population\nlikely to show impairment in learning to reach: infants at high risk for cerebral palsy. In exploratory Aim 4 we will\ndescribe patterns of concurrent brain activity during spontaneous arm movements, early reaching attempts, and\nskilled reaches in infants at high risk for cerebral palsy. Our results will determine the most relevant factors\nrelated to an infant\u2019s ability to refine his brain function and neuromotor control as he learns to reach.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and affects over 6 million Americans. There is\nno cure for AD, and many potential treatments have failed, creating a critical need for the development of\nadditional disease models for novel therapeutic discovery and testing. The hallmark pathology of AD includes\namyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau)-containing neurofibrillary tangles. This pathology is\nassociated with memory loss, which is diagnostic for AD, but is now known to be preceded by earlier prodromal\nsymptoms including mood and sleep disorders. Dysregulation of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) is\nassociated with AD symptoms, as its release in the forebrain regulates attention, arousal, stress response, and\nlearning and memory. Importantly, the locus coeruleus (LC), the main noradrenergic nucleus in the brain and\nsource of NE in the forebrain, is the first brain region to develop ptau inclusions, may transmit pathogenic tau to\nthe forebrain, and undergoes catastrophic degeneration in later stages of the disease. Recent evidence indicates\nthat that early ptau-mediated LC dysfunction contributes to the prodromal symptoms of AD, while LC neuronal\nloss later in the disease exacerbates cognitive impairment. However, nearly all information about the LC in AD\nhas been derived from rodent models and postmortem or human imaging studies. It is not known how the early\nptau accumulation in the human LC affects neuronal function or NE transmission. Organoids, which are 3D\nhuman cell culture models derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, emulate the architecture and\nfunction of human tissue. The goal of this proposal is to develop the first human LC organoid model to address\nquestions related to the earliest stages of AD. In Aim 1, I will validate our LC organoids by comparing their\nstructure and function to human and rodent LC neurons. I will then combine LC organoids with cortical organoids\nto define assembloid connectivity by tracking NE innervation of the cortical organoids. In Aim 2, I will derive LC\norganoids from AD patients and compare their structure, function, and AD pathology to that of LC organoids\nderived from healthy subjects. Following LC-cortical assembloid creation, I will assess the consequences of NE\nAD pathology transmission from AD LC organoids to control cortical organoids. Together, the proposed\nexperiments will provide new insights on AD pathology and normal and AD LC-cortex connectivity in living human\nneurons. This information would greatly impact AD research and provides a novel model for the development of\nnew treatment strategies for patients in the earliest stages of AD.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "A controlled evaluation of abstinence-induced withdrawal and motivation to vape/smoke among daily ENDS users vs. cigarette smokers",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nDespite the importance of smoking withdrawal symptoms (e.g., craving, negative affect, disrupted cognition)\nfor understanding tobacco/nicotine dependence and elucidating intervention targets, the parent study is the\nfirst-ever prospective, controlled comparison of abstinence-induced withdrawal between people who use\nelectronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and those who smoke cigarettes. However, like most research in\nthe field, we currently exclude people with schizophrenia (SCZ). Lack of representation of people with SCZ is a\nmajor problem in nicotine/tobacco research, contributing to greater tobacco-related health disparities than\nperhaps any other population segment, with extremely high rates of use and low rates of cessation, which\ncontributes to a marked excess in morbidity and mortality. A burgeoning literature is examining ENDS as a\nharm reduction approach to tobacco smoking. However, there are major concerns with this direction of\nresearch, particularly for people with SCZ. Though ENDS appear much less harmful than cigarettes, they still\ncarry neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular consequences, and research on interventions for vaping cessation is\nin its infancy. Indeed, the addiction liability of ENDS in people with SCZ is unknown. It is critical that we\nunderstand how withdrawal from ENDS compares to that of cigarettes. Notably, results from the general\npopulation (like the parent study) may not generalize to SCZ as they may be more vulnerable to ENDS\ndependency and experience different or more severe withdrawal due to multiple disease-related factors. The\nproposed supplement leverages the strengths of the parent study, which focuses on the general population, and\nenhances its overall project impact and relevance to health disparities by recruiting a sample of people with\nSCZ, half of whom vape ENDS daily and half of whom smoke daily. The supplement will provide novel data on\nthe effects of 24-hr abstinence from vaping vs smoking on self- report and objective assessments of major\nfacets of withdrawal in people with SCZ, as well as changes in neuropsychiatric symptoms. It will also provide a\nnovel comparison of vaping/smoking withdrawal in people with SCZ (the supplemental data) to a matched\ngroup of people without SCZ (from the parent trial) and explore candidate moderators (e.g., antipsychotic\nclass, sex). Results will provide the first literature on ENDS withdrawal in people with SCZ, who continue to be\nan under-represented group in nicotine/tobacco research, despite their facing marked tobacco-related health\ndisparities (a NIDA strategic plan cross-cutting theme). Results will directly inform the suitability of ENDS for\ntobacco harm reduction (NIDA strategic plan priority area #2) in people with SCZ. Moreover, the\ncomprehensive, multi-modal assessment of withdrawal facets will directly inform the development of ENDS\ncessation interventions for people with SCZ.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nSleep patterns characterized by truncated weekday sleep followed by weekend recovery sleep (\u2018social jetlag\u2019)\noften begin to emerge during pre-adolescence (8-12 years). Research from our team has demonstrated that\nthis sleep pattern adversely impacts positive valence systems (PVS) in ways that elevate risk for depression\nand other psychiatric disorders. Heightened neuroplasticity and re-organization of reward-related brain regions\npresent during this period of the lifespan likely confer a unique opportunity for prevention and intervention, but\nresearch on sleep-affective relations during this vulnerable period of development remains limited. The present\nset of studies will examine mechanistic pathways between behavioral and neurophysiological (EEG) sleep\npatterns and PVS in social and non-social contexts during pre-adolescence. Study 1 includes an intensive one-\nyear longitudinal burst design with a non-clinical sample of youth (N = 290; ages 8-12). At three separate\nassessment waves (6 months apart), participants will complete a 14-day monitoring period including objective\nsleep using actigraphy, daily video diaries and surveys, passive audio recordings of naturalistic social\ninteractions, and a series of behavioral tasks to assess reward responsiveness, learning, and valuation. This\nlongitudinal study is complemented by Study 2, which includes a separate sample of non-clinical youth (N =\n64; ages 10-12) who will complete an experimental protocol using a randomized crossover design. Participants\nwill stay in the laboratory with a friend for two 5-night visits where dyads will simultaneously undergo multiple\nnights of sleep restriction followed by recovery sleep, as well as 5 nights of healthy sleep. Each evening in the\nlab, participants will complete surveys and paradigms assessing social and non-social reward responsiveness,\nlearning, and valuation. A daily recorded interaction period with their peer will also be coded for positive social\nbehaviors (approach behaviors, affective synchrony, positive affective expression, and gaze patterns using eye\ntracking). Participants will also complete polysomnography during each night of the laboratory protocols and\nchanges in sleep EEG (i.e., rapid eye movement sleep) will be examined as a mechanism underlying daytime\nsocioemotional changes. Additional analyses for both studies focus on how biological sex modifies\nsocioemotional vulnerability to sleep patterns. The proposed research addresses multiple critical gaps in\nscientific knowledge surrounding the impact of sleep on the development of reward systems and social\nfunctioning during pre-adolescence. Specific aims leverage RDoC, including PVS and Arousal/Regulatory\nsystems, and support NIMH\u2019s strategic plan to chart mental illness trajectories and determine when, where,\nand how to intervene. Results will inform theories of these neurodevelopmental processes to better inform\nprevention and treatment efforts.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nIntrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are neurons of the mammalian eye that capture light\nwith a molecule called melanopsin, triggering a phototransduction cascade to generate an electrical response.\nThis response influences dozens of brain regions and is essential for light\u2019s normal regulation of processes that\ninclude the circadian clock, sleep, mood, and pupil constriction. Our preliminary experiments reveal ipRGC\nresponse features that are suited to these processes and qualitatively distinct from those of the classic rod and\ncone photoreceptors. We propose to characterize these response features, learn how they arise from\nmolecular mechanisms within ipRGCs, and define how they shape signals sent from ipRGCs to the brain. We\nwill apply patch-clamp electrophysiological recording to the ex vivo mouse retina and its isolated cells,\nintroducing methods that increase the physiological relevance of our findings. Our experiments will strengthen\nthe basic understanding of ipRGCs, sensory transduction, and ion channels. They will also provide insight into\nthe broad question of how cells of particular types are tailored to specific tasks.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Temporally scalable recording of brain-wide single-cell physiology",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nMany fundamental questions in neuroscience and neurological disorders, such as those associated with\nlearning, memory, sleep, aging, and disease progression, would benefit greatly from a technology that enables\nbrain-wide single-cell readout of signaling activities and gene expression changes over extended time periods\n(over weeks, months, to even years). Current single-cell physiology recording methods require external\ninterfacing to live cells, either optically (via fluorescent probes plus microscopy) or electrically (via electrical\nprobes). It has been a major challenge to perform long-term optical imaging in vivo beyond several hours, due\nto fast photobleaching of fluorescent probes. Electrical probes, on the other hand, often induce unwanted long-\nterm immune response after implantation and do not support measurement of intracellular signaling and gene\nexpression activities. In addition, these single-cell recording methods do not support large-scale readout\nacross the whole brain, while modalities that can image whole brains, such as ultrasound, MRI, and CT, lack\nsingle-cell resolutions. We aim to bridge this technological gap by developing a genetically encoded,\ntemporally scalable \u2018protein ticker tape\u2019 recording system, to enable long-term, brain-wide recording of single-\ncell physiology in vivo without any external interfacing to live cells. In our prior work, we found it is possible to\nrecord and store cell physiology histories over time, such as gene expression histories, along elongating\nprotein self-assemblies in live cells (analogous to tree rings permanently storing wood\u2019s growth conditions), for\nsubsequent single-cell readout in situ via simple post-mortem tissue processing and imaging techniques. In\nthis project, we will leverage our expertise in protein engineering and neurotechnology development to\ntransform this protein ticker tape concept into a technological solution that enables brain-wide single-cell\nphysiology recording over long (up to a year) and scalable periods of time, where the recording duration is\nexternally defined by users. We will first engineer novel protein assemblies, via an AI-powered protein design\napproach, to boost the information storage capacity and recording precision of protein ticker tapes. Next, we\nwill employ chemical and light dependent expression systems to externally control the elongation speed of the\nprotein self-assembly, to enable various recording durations (from a day to a year) externally defined by users.\nFinally, we will couple protein ticker tapes to promoters and synthetic expression systems that respond to\nsignaling events, transcription factor activities, circadian rhythms, and gene expression levels, to enable\nrecording of these cell physiological events separately and in parallel. We will genetically deliver these protein\nticker tapes in single cells across living mouse brains to characterize and validate their performance, fidelity,\nand safety to cells and tissue, followed by demonstrations of long-term, brain-wide, single-cell physiology\nrecording in healthy and diseased mouse models. We envision this novel recording technology with both\nspatial and temporal scalabilities to have a broad impact in biology and medicine.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Prospective Health Impacts of Chronic Binge Eating Disorder in Hispanic Older Women Living with Food Insecurity (PROSPERA)",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nWomen live longer than men, yet they also experience greater morbidity, which makes understanding how\nspecific chronic conditions further impact multimorbidity in women essential. Importantly, chronic conditions\ndisproportionately affect certain women, including those who are historically underrepresented, understudied,\nand underreported (U3) in biomedical research. Binge Eating Disorder (BED) involves discrete episodes\n(\u22651/week) of eating abnormally large amounts of food in one sitting while feeling out of control. BED is more\ncommon among women than men and is associated with poor cardiometabolic and mental health profiles,\nadjusting for BMI. As with many chronic conditions, disparities exist in both the prevalence and understanding\nof chronic BED within subpopulations of women. Specifically, because eating disorders are stereotyped as\ndisorders of youth, white race, and affluence, data in populations beyond this stereotype are highly limited.\nYet, recent evidence indicates greater BED prevalence and negative health correlates among women in two\nunderstudied areas: 1) older age, and 2) economically disadvantaged. Cross-sectional research suggests\nnearly 20% of women aged \u226560 years may meet BED severity criteria, and that those with BED experience\npoorer mental health and quality of life, and profound cardiometabolic morbidity. Recent research among\nlargely Hispanic/Latino (H/L) samples living with food insecurity (FI) found that 17-20% of older women (aged\n\u226551 years) met BED severity criteria. One limitation to this research is its cross-sectional nature. Thus, the\nprospective health impacts of BED among older H/L women living with FI remains unknown. Another limitation\nis the insufficient exploration of environmental factors (e.g., psychosocial; social determinants of health\n[SDoH]) that influence cardiometabolic risk in older H/L women who have chronic BED and live with FI. The\nspecific research objectives of this R01 are to determine the prospective mental and cardiometabolic health\nimpacts of chronic BED in older H/L women living with FI, thus creating a risk index for the health burden of\nBED and FI in later life for H/L women. The proposed study will include 250 older (\u226550 years) H/L women living\nwith FI (n =125 with chronic BED & n = 125 no lifetime history of any eating disorder) to assess the prospective\nimpact of BED on cardiometabolic health (e.g., HbA1C, BMI change), sarcopenic obesity, menopause quality\nof life, physical functioning, and depression over 2 years, and to explore SDoH factors between groups on\noutcomes (Aim 1); examine longitudinal trajectories of BED and FI (Aim 2); and explore the lived experiences\nand major life events among participants with and without BED in a concurrent nested mixed-method design\n(Aim 3). The long-term objectives of this research program are to a) elucidate potential factors of influence\n(e.g., mediators/moderators) on the health burden of chronic BED in older H/L women living with FI, b) develop\nU3 relevant, scalable interventions so that healthcare providers and hunger relief organizations can improve\nservices, and c) generate data for policy change to ultimately reduce multimorbidity in this U3 population.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Effects of Successful OSA TreatmENT on Memory and AD BIomarkers in Older AduLts (ESSENTIAL)",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "The prevalence of Alzheimer disease (AD) is high and projected to increase. Further, epidemiological data\nsuggests that ~15% of AD risk may be attributed to sleep problems. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is also\ncommon among the elderly (30-55%), and our prior work has established that cognitively normal older women\nwith OSA have nearly double the 5-year risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia.\nFurther, we showed that: i. OSA patients treated with positive airway pressure (PAP) experienced significant\novernight increases in plasma neurofilament light (NfL), a marker of neural injury, with strong trends for AD-\nspecific biomarkers (i.e. A\u03b240 and Tau) after PAP withdrawal; ii. OSA predicted longitudinal increases in AD\nbiomarkers; and, iii. PAP treatment delayed the onset of MCI in subjects with reported OSA. There is therefore\nstrong evidence suggesting that OSA treatment could be an important prevention strategy for AD. However,\ntrials for treatment of OSA to slow cognitive decline and progression to AD face a number of challenges. First,\nthe most effective therapy (PAP) has poor adherence. A second challenge is defining the target population:\nprior trials targeted OSA patients with MCI/AD, who have more advanced disease and could be less amenable\nto treatment. A third challenge is identifying cognitive testing that is sensitive to sleep disruption, and linked to\nincreased AD risk. (To capture effects of OSA on the offline processing phase requires sleep-dependent\nmemory paradigms, in which the encoding and recall of information are separated by a period of sleep\nwith/without OSA). Finally, a randomized trial of sufficient duration to test the effects of treatment of OSA on\nrisk of incident AD is not feasible. Our proposed trial, Effects of Successful OSA TreatmENT on Memory and\nAD BIomarkers in Older AduLts (ESSENTIAL), addresses these challenges. ESSENTIAL is a 5-year study of\ncognitively normal older adults with newly diagnosed OSA, ages 55-75, recruited from 4 well-established sleep\nclinics. OSA patients (n=200) will be randomized to either: i) a 3-month OSA treatment by any combination of\nPAP, OAT, and positional therapy that results in an \u201ceffective\u201d improvement in the apnea-hypopnea index\n(AHI); ii) a waitlist control group to receive treatment at the conclusion of the 3-month intervention period.\nEffectively treated individuals (~150) and untreated individuals (~100) will then be followed for up to 24 months\nto compare whether sustained improvements in AHI are associated with better cognitive function and AD\nbiomarker change profiles as compared to untreated controls. Participants will undergo PSG, actigraphy,\ncognitive tests, and blood draws at baseline, 3 and 24 months. Our aims are: 1) To compare 3-month change\nin plasma AD biomarkers (NfL, p-tau, A\u03b2) between those randomized to OSA treatment and wait-list control\ngroups; 2) To compare 3-month change in cognition between the OSA treatment and wait-list control groups;\n3) To examine if sustained reduction in AHI over 24 months among effectively treated participants versus\nuntreated controls is associated with better 24-month change profiles for AD biomarkers and cognition.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nPoor sleep impacts health in many ways, so improved sleep could yield wide-ranging public-health benefits.\nSleep-disordered breathing constitutes a huge public-health problem and current treatments fail for many\npatients. Lapses in breathing can fragment sleep, disrupt oxygen levels, and cause other problems.\nContemporary treatments for sleep disorders and recommendations for sleep hygiene are valuable, but more\ncan be done to engender health-promoting sleep - this project will introduce new strategies for real-time\nmodulation of sleep physiology that have not been applied or tested in this context.\nBasic memory research has shown that memory networks in the brain are active during sleep and that we\ncan alter this activity. Variants of this method here won't aim to improve memory, as in our past studies, but\nrather to impact physiology to yield specific health benefits. Using soft sounds that avoid sleep disruption, with\nstate-of-the-art monitoring devices applied in the home (nasal respiration, in-ear EEG, and chest EKG), we\naim to change what people do during sleep - their mental and physical sleep habits. The moment one falls\nasleep, one's sleep physiology seems automatic and largely beyond control. Yet, our twofold premise is that\n(1) memories and habits naturally reactivate during sleep, and (2) we can intervene to strategically modify this\nreactivation to achieve specific health-focused goals, transcending basic memory research, as follows.\nWe start with obstructive sleep apnea patients without structural upper-airway abnormalities. Poor neural\ncontrol of breathing during sleep likely contributes to many such cases. Patients will first undergo extensive\ndaytime training to elicit inhalation when a cue sound is played, such that responses become automatized.\nAfter training, patients continue emitting the conditioned response at night as they fall asleep and, remarkably,\nthey continue to do so during sleep, thus reducing apnea symptoms. Lab studies testing the methodology will\npave the way for at-home studies; this therapy is designed to be easy-to-use in the home via wearable tech\nand sound delivery configured to avoid arousal and target periods when respiration is insufficient (i.e., closedloop\nstimulation adjusted based on real-time respiration, movement, and EEG recorded wirelessly).\nExpansion to additional applications will be guided by evidence-based methodological insights and will fuel\nthe development of a new understanding of high-quality sleep. For example, people with or without apnea may\nhave affect-laden sleep that is maladaptive, as when unconscious rumination pervades sleep. We thus seek to\nbias overnight thinking in positive directions to enhance sleep quality; sound cues during sleep will displace\nanxious- or depressive-memory retrieval by promoting positive-memory retrieval. Given that suboptimal sleep\nis associated with poorer outcomes for mental and physical health, we envision a means to optimize sleep by\ncorrecting maladaptive muscular or affective activity, The high-risk challenge is to develop noninvasive, lowcost,\nprecision-sleep-control interventions with adaptive protocols to produce better sleep at home.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nIntense natural disasters including hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes have become more frequent and\nclosely spaced in recent years. Large scale natural disasters can severely damage and degrade health care\nfacility structural integrity and equipment, create environmental hazards, and negatively affect health service\ndelivery (e.g., cancelled surgeries; postponed preventive care; pharmacy closures; staffing, medication, and\nmedical supply shortages; large transient surges in emergency department volume) \u2013 all of which contribute to\nincreased stress among health care providers. Superimposing infectious disease epidemics on the natural\ndisasters further exacerbates stress on the health care system. Over the span of 3 years, Puerto Rico suffered\nfrom 3 major back-to-back public health emergencies including 2 natural disasters and a pandemic. First,\nHurricane Maria hit in September 2017 causing major devastation throughout the island. Communities lost\naccess to essential services such as electricity, potable water, safe roads and bridges, and health care. Most\nof the island\u2019s public and private health care facilities closed or had limited capacity for months. Second, in\nDecember 2019, a series of more than 500 quakes of magnitude 2.0 or greater struck Puerto Rico causing\nmore infrastructure damage to many struggling health facilities and leaving thousands homeless or living\noutside in their yards. Third, Puerto Rico continues to deal with the novel coronavirus-19 (COVID-19)\npandemic. This study will provide a unique opportunity to understand the effects of 3 distinct public health\nemergencies on a minority population with significant health and health care disparities. We have designed a\nmixed methods, multi-level study that will triangulate quantitative and qualitative data to study the pre and post\neffects of the 3 public health emergencies on Puerto Rico\u2019s health care system\u2019s preparedness, response, and\nrecovery efforts and how the emergencies have affected the resiliency, experiences, and utilization of the\nisland\u2019s health care system. The study will use administrative utilization data from 50 general hospitals and 20\nfederally funded health centers on the island, qualitative interviews of health system leaders and providers, and\nfollow-up interviews of a representative cohort of 3,062 island adult residents. Using the Donabedian quality of\ncare model and concepts from an emerging literature on health system resilience as our study framework, we\nwill 1) identify factors that influenced the capacity of Puerto Rico\u2019s health care system to prepare for, respond\nto, and recover from Hurricane Maria, the earthquakes, and COVID-19, 2) model the cumulative effects of\nmultiple disasters on health system resiliency and how these effects interact, and 3) elicit lessons learned from\nhealth care leaders and providers. We will synthesize the information from our triangulated research approach\nto provide data driven recommendations for an effective and coordinated approach to mitigation,\npreparedness, response, and resiliency under conditions of increasing frequency and intensity of disasters.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "It is estimated that around 10% of reproductive-age women of European ancestry, and 15% of women of Asian ancestry are impacted by endometriosis. In endometriosis, glandular epithelium and stroma closely resembling the cells of the endometrium grow outside of the uterine cavity, evading the typical cell-intrinsic (programmed cell death) and cell-extrinsic safeguards (such as immune surveillance) that should prevent cells from surviving at ectopic locations. Endometriosis causes myriad symptoms including infertility, dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps), deep dyspareunia (pain with deep penetration during sexual activity), dyschezia and dysuria (painful bowel movements and voiding), and chronic pelvic pain. Epidemiologic and genetic studies consistently find associations between endometriosis and inflammatory conditions such as asthma, irritable bowel syndrome and autoimmune disorders. Inflammation plays a central role in endometriosis, and the overarching hypothesis of this research is that studying risk loci shared by endometriosis and inflammatory conditions likely have a role for hormonal modulation, since endometriosis is an estrogen-driven disease. \nThe goal of this proposal is to characterize key immune pathways that interact with hormonal responses in endometriosis. This will be achieved through large-scale population based genetic comorbidity studies and single cell systems biology methods to nominate shared risk genes and state-of-the-art single cell and spatial molecular profiling of follicular and luteal phase endometriosis. Key cell-cell signaling axes will be validated for their therapeutic potential using heterotypic in vitro and in vivo models of endometriosis. We will primarily focus on the proinflammatory IL1 pathway as a risk locus for endometriosis coincides with the IL1 gene family cluster. Based on integration of genome-wide risk data and single cell gene expression analysis of endometriosis we hypothesize that IL1A and/or IL1B expression by M2 macrophages combined with IL1 receptor expression in hormone-sensitive endometriosis epithelial cells is the pathway underlying risk at this locus. We will validate this hypothesis with multiomics and spatial profiling, and then dissect the roles of the key genes and cell populations using our existing state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo models. \nThis research will validate IL1 signaling as a key therapeutic target for endometriosis-associated inflammation, and will likely nominate additional candidates. Subsequent research will focus on clinical translation of these results. Endometriosis represents the ideal system to study hormonal regulation of inflammation, and pleiotropy, and so we expect that the impact of this study will extend to other inflammatory traits that are more common in women, and to the post-GWAS field in general.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\n Auto brewery syndrome (ABS), also known as gut fermentation syndrome, is a rare condition in which a\ndysfunctional intestinal microbiome produces ethanol, which is absorbed and results in intoxication. ABS may\nresult in behavioral, familial, social, and legal problems and is difficult to diagnose in part because of its rarity,\nand because alcohol use disorder is common. Patients typically have \u201cflares\u201d of the condition, with episodes of\ninebriation. ABS may be caused by yeast, sometimes brewer\u2019s yeast or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but it may\nalso be associated with bacteria, such as Klebsiella species, E. coli or others, sometimes in combination. We\nrecruited 38 ABS patients and their household partners (HHP). Preliminary data showed that anaerobic\nbioreactor cultures of ABS patient microbiota produced ex vivo significantly more ethanol than that of HHP.\nEthanol production was abrogated by antibiotic treatment. Metagenomic analysis of fecal samples showed higher\nproportions of several bacterial species and of genomic DNA encoding alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in stool of\npatients with ABS as compared with HHP. These findings indicate that pathologic production of ethanol is driven\nby gut bacteria in most ABS patients. We have safely treated one ABS patient with an active flare using capsule\nfecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) under a single patient treatment IND. The patient achieved clinical\nremission. We hypothesize that FMT in ABS patients is safe, tolerable and may result in an eradication of alcohol\nproducing microbes. We therefore propose a phase 1, open label safety and feasibility study of capsule-based\nFMT in subjects with ABS under FDA and IRB supervision. Primary clinical outcomes are safety and feasibility;\nsecondary and exploratory endpoints include clinical outcomes and assessment of flares by blood and\nbreathalyzer ethanol monitoring, dietary intake, and microbiome and bioreactor assessment of stool samples.\nThese studies may reveal a new and safe therapeutic approach for patients with ABS, and will improve our\nunderstanding of how gut microbial ethanol production contributes to the disease. Results from this safety and\ntolerability study may lead to the conduct of a larger randomized controlled clinical trial for FMT use in patients\nwith ABS. The study may also inform our understanding of the effect of the microbiome on other hepatic and\nmetabolic disorders.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAntibiotic-induced disruption (AID) of the gut microbiome can lead to severe conditions like C. diff colitis and \nmay contribute to long-term health issues, including obesity and diabetes. There is an urgent need to develop \ninterventions that mitigate these negative impacts while preserving the antibiotics' effectiveness. Our preliminary \ndata suggest that dietary fiber reduces antibiotic disruption by decreasing the gut's redox potential, which in turn \nfavors a low-energy, fermentative metabolic environment. This environment protects core microbiome members \nby reducing their metabolic rate and ATP production, which are linked to antibiotic susceptibility.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "3. Abstract\nInflammation is a beneficial response to infection or tissue damage and mediates the removal of\nmicrobial pathogens and restoration of the tissue to homeostasis. Occasionally the inflammatory\nresponse does not resolve properly and becomes a chronic process, resulting in diseases such as\narthritis, asthma, and many others. Significant effort has gone into developing therapeutics to block\nthe development of inflammation; however, these approaches also increase the risk of serious\ninfection due to simultaneous inhibition of the host immune defense against microbial pathogens.\nRecent work has demonstrated that the resolution of inflammation is an active and dynamic process.\nNeutrophils recruited to the infected/damaged tissue phagocytose and kill invading bacteria, undergo\napoptosis, and are cleared by macrophages (efferocytosis). Efferocytosis is a key component of the\nresolution process and induces a switch from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory processes in\nmacrophages. This switch results in decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, increased\nproduction of anti-inflammatory mediators, enhanced efferocytosis, diminished neutrophil recruitment,\nand promotes tissue healing and a return to homeostasis. Recently, however, another mechanism\nhas been described that may directly impact inflammation resolution, reverse transendothelial\nmigration of neutrophils (rTEM). In this mechanism, neutrophils that enter the tissue during\ninflammatory responses do not die there, but rather re-enter the vasculature and travel to the lungs\nbefore proceeding to the bone marrow where they ultimately die. This process appears to be at least\npartially mediated by eicosanoids, specifically LTB4, PGE2, and LXA4. Our previous work has\ndemonstrated the failure of Lyme arthritis resolution in mice deficient in these inflammatory mediators.\nBased upon our preliminary data, we hypothesize that neutrophils that enter tissues and encounter\nmicrobes will remain in the tissues and undergo apoptosis there, if there are no microbes\nencountered the neutrophils will undergo rTEM and exit the tissue. This proposal will investigate the\nrole of rTEM in inflammation resolution and the roles of LTB4, PGE2, and LXA4 in mediating this\nresponse. Successful completion of these studies will provide new knowledge and understanding of\nneutrophil trafficking during inflammation and the role of rTEM in inflammation resolution.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nEmergency department clinicians (ECs) regularly experience among the highest rates of psychological\ndistress. Manifesting in poor well-being and burnout, EC psychological distress can lead to adverse outcomes\nfor patient care, institutions (e.g., costly attrition), and individual ECs (e.g., illness and death). On-going\nsurveys conducted by the research team since 2020 have collected validated measures of an EC well-being\nindex and burnout score for three types of ECs (attendings, Advanced Practice Clinicians, and residents) at\nseven emergency department locations at a large academic health system in upstate South Carolina.\nLocations span urban to rural settings. Our interdisciplinary team proposes to link key contextual factors of\ninstitutional stressors (including staffing strain and patient congestion) with coincident contextual factors\n(including external pandemic status and individual demographic characteristics) to measure and visualize well-\nbeing and burnout. Aim 1 will quantify the relationships between stressors and context with well-being and\nburnout. Generalized linear mixed effects models will consider contributors of each predictor on both\noutcomes, and factor analysis will compare the relative contribution of each predictor. Machine learning\nmethods will be used to develop a predictive model to evaluate future burnout risk. In Aim 2, we will develop a\nvisualization framework to display predictors and corresponding real-time predictions of well-being. Iterative\nrefinement will improve the visualization channels, user performance, and support accessibility. Mixed-method\nvalidation with EC leadership will involve interviews to probe interpretation of data insights with the graphical\nframework and eye-tracking to evaluate performance and speed. Consistent with the exploratory nature of an\nR21, the visualization will be developed with EC-informed hypothetical values. A follow-on study will be\nproposed to integrate the work both aims and to implement and evaluate the use of the visualization to improve\ninterpretation in practice. We anticipate that this research will both spur further work to develop decision-\nsupport tools to address modifiable factors to improve well-being and have immediate impact in understanding\ncontributors to EC well-being and burnout. This work seeks to improve EC experience to interrupt the negative\nfeedback loop that drives adverse outcomes in patient care, EC turnover, and institutional goals to ultimately\nimprove EC well-being and patient care.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nThe combination of COVID-19 and alcohol/substance use disorders exacerbates a wide range of existing\nproblems, including the likelihood of contracting COVID and severity of consequences, pandemic-related\nstresses that trigger alcohol and substance use, loss of jobs and healthcare access, increased interpersonal\nviolence, and overarching systemic inequities. Interventions are needed to address these serious problems,\nwhich are likely to persist even after widespread availability of COVID vaccines.\nIn response to PAR 20-243, this R01 project is a Hybrid II RCT/implementation study modifying and testing two\nof our alcohol smartphone interventions to address the fallout from COVID. We propose a 3-arm RCT\ncomparing a control vs. a drinker-focused intervention vs. a family-focused intervention. The drinker-focused\nintervention (ACHESS-C) is an extension of our evidence-based Addiction\u2013Comprehensive Health\nEnhancement Support system (ACHESS), augmented with COVID resources. The family-focused intervention\n(FamCHESS-C) combines ACHESS-C services with evidence-based Alcohol Behavioral Couple Therapy\nservices to help both drinker and partner with behavior change, relationship problems, and general well-being.\nIn the proposed 8-month trial plus 4-month follow-up, 198 dyads (drinker + family member) will be randomly\nassigned to: 1) Smartphone control: both receive a smartphone with standard support and crisis numbers; 2)\nACHESS-C: drinker receives a phone with ACHESS-C, partner receives a phone with support and crisis\nnumbers; 3) Fam-CHESS-C: both receive phone with FamCHESS-C. The project has the following aims:\nAim 1: Complete refinements to the FamCHESS-C app.\nAim 2: Conduct a balanced RCT to test the following outcomes: Primary: 1) drinker % heavy drinking days, 2)\ndyad quality of life. Secondary: 3) dyad relationship satisfaction, 4) dyad psychological/physical conflict, 5)\ndrinker no heavy drinking days, 6) drinker % days alcohol/drug use, 7) dyad COVID vaccination rates, 8)\ndrinker alcohol- and drug-related problems. Exploratory: 9) partner % days alcohol/drug use, 10) dyad crisis\nhealthcare use, 11) dyad technology satisfaction. We hypothesize that outcomes will be more favorable in\nFamCHESS-C relative to ACHESS-C, and both will be more favorable relative to smartphone control.\nAim 3: Examine mediation effects of dyad's competence, relatedness, and motivation; drinker's interim change\nin % days of alcohol and drug use, and extent of app use for comparisons of ACHESS-C and FamCHESS-C.\nExamine moderation of effects of condition by drinker sex, severity of drinker\u2019s baseline alcohol use, drinker\nengagement in treatment for AUD/SUD, and dyad\u2019s baseline relationship satisfaction.\nAim 4: Conduct a small-scale (20 dyads) formative evaluation using an implementation science model to\ncollect qualitative data on perceptions of difficulties and benefits of ACHESS-C and FamCHESS-C use.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "SUMMARY\nThe main mission of the P41 Biomedical Technology Research Resource for Macromolecular Modeling and\nBioinformatics (P41-GM104601) over the last three decades has been developing state of the art computational\ntechnologies for biomolecular and cell simulations and visualization, implementing them in ef\ufb01cient, economical,\nuser-friendly software solutions, and disseminating them to the biomedical community at no cost. The Resource\nhas enabled high-quality, rigorous research for the biomedical scientists who need to integrate molecular and\ncell modeling, simulation, and visualization in their research, not only at diverse academic institutions, but also\nin industry. The \ufb02agship software programs, VMD and NAMD and their auxiliary plugins, are used currently\nby more than 125,000 users and have received a staggering number of 57,000 citations (19,711 in 2018-2021\nalone), re\ufb02ecting the massive use of the technologies and programs developed by the Resource, and its sub-\nstantial economies of scale. The Resource's partnership with the biomedical community resulted in the 2020\nACM Gordon Bell Special Prize for COVID-19 Research. Under the R24 mode of operation, a major goal of\nthe Resource will be to ensure that its software solutions remain current and available to its large user base on\nexisting and upcoming hardware platforms commonly used at local and institutional levels, and at national super-\ncomputing centers, where a large fraction of the overall time is consumed by biomedical researchers using the\nResource's programs. Given the key position of these programs, several major supercomputing centers as well\nas major hardware vendors have established strong relationships with the Resource, even directly supporting\nsoftware development and optimization. In addition, the Resource will ensure the utility of its programs by includ-\ning algorithmic changes/updates that are critical to applicability of the codes and/or demanded by the community.\nThe Resource will also sustain and expand its comprehensive user training program, empowered by an already\nexisting, large collection of online tutorials, case studies, and hands-on workshops.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nDemographic and social forces that influence human behavior fundamentally shape the epidemiology of\ninfectious diseases, but are often left out from mathematical models of disease transmission. Our recent work\nhas added to the growing body of evidence that patterns of how humans come into contact with one another,\nand the adoption of behaviors to reduce transmission, are highly heterogeneous across individuals and groups\nin a population; these behaviors are strongly influenced by how societies are structured and the socio-\neconomic, environmental, and political contexts in which epidemics occur. These same forces influence\npatterns of exposure, susceptibility, and health outcomes. Human behavior also varies temporally and\nspatially, leading to heterogeneities in transmission across space and time and the possibility of dynamical\nfeedback between the disease environment and the socio-demographic processes that influence human\nbehavior. Driven by the public health imperative to understand and address disparities in infection exposure\nand risk, I propose to develop new models and methods for understanding how demographic and social\nprocesses \u2013 from individual heterogeneities to large-scale patterns of population behavior \u2013 drive infectious\ndisease risk across scales. Specifically, my research group will develop a generalized framework for jointly\nmodeling human behavioral changes and disease dynamics, with bi-directional feedback between behavior\nand the disease environment. We will also build and validate models for incorporating data on human mobility\nand aggregation at the population level, while incorporating other extrinsic drivers of transmission such as\nclimate. We will parameterize these models by leveraging detailed human behavioral data from an ongoing\nsurvey platform as well as novel sources of mobile phone and digital trace data, and validate model results by\nfitting to epidemiological geo-located time series data. Our modeling approach will be flexible and dynamic,\nallowing us to adapt it for specific pathogens and regions of interest. The project results will provide a better\nunderstanding of the complex interactions between human behavior and the fundamental biological processes\nunderlying disease transmission, with the ultimate aim of guiding control efforts, designing equity-focused\ninterventions, and improving our ability to predict and prepare for outbreaks.\n1",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe purpose of this administrative supplement proposal is to expand the studies in our parent project\nR03DE033541-01, Leveraging All of Us data to unravel the interconnectedness between dental and systemic\ndisease. In the parent project, we are conducting a large-scale study leveraging and integrating high-quality\nclinical (dental and medical), genomic, and demographic data available from >250,000 participants in the All of\nUs Research Program (AoU) to identify host factors most likely contributing to a combined phenotype of dental\n+ systemic disease. For this administrative supplement, we propose to expand the above studies to include AoU\nparticipant survey data and employ an intersectional approach incorporating analyses of lifestyle, health care\naccess and utilization, and other social determinants of health (SDOH), in order to identify the SDOH domains\nmost likely to intersect with the dental and systemic conditions being assessed on the parent project, with a focus\non women\u2019s health. Several lines of evidence have shown that SDOH are linked to differences in prevalence of\noral and systemic disease and reduced opportunities for health and health-related quality of life, particularly in\nwomen. However, there is a lack of studies integrating individual biological (e.g., genomic, sex at birth), and\nnonbiological (e.g. SDOH) aspects thereby precluding our ability to understand the full spectrum of the common\ncauses and pathways of dental/systemic disease and their interactions as contributors to differential disease\npredisposition or manifestation. Here, we will test the hypothesis that non-biological SDOH factors may intersect\nwith biological sex to influence disease predisposition and/or clinical manifestation. We will integrate SDOH data\navailable for the AoU participants that are being used in our parent project to the clinical and genomic data\nobtained and apply a multidimensional analysis framework to explore the intersectional effects of biological and\nnon-biological (SDOH) factors and contributing to a combined phenotype of dental + systemic disease in males\nand females. This study represents a major advance in the field by creating a roadmap for integrating clinical,\ngenomic, demographic and survey data from a large and diverse population in the AoU program to develop a\nmore comprehensive picture of the factors contributing to oral and systemic health/disease relationships between\nthe sexes. This proposal addresses the Trans-NIH Strategic Plan for Women\u2019s Health Research goal #1\nAdvancing rigorous research, and the NIDCR\u2019s Strategic Priorities #1 Integrate Oral and General Health, and #2\nPrecision Dental Medicine.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nEven before the onset of the COVID pandemic, adolescent depression has been increasing, and health dispar-\nities and disparities in access to treatment have continued to widen. Thus, there is a clear need for innovative,\naccessible treatments for depressed adolescents, including treatments that do not rely on a limited pool of child\nand adolescent health providers. Yoga-based interventions (YBIs) have shown promise for adult depression.\nSeveral attractive aspects of yoga include its: 1) availability throughout the U.S.; 2) accessibility via online clas-\nses; 3) independence from an overburdened mental health care system; and 4) generalizability--yoga students\nstate that they use mindfulness and breathing practices to cope with stress in everyday life. Funded by a\nNCCIH R34, we developed a YBI for depressed adolescents, and demonstrated that this in-person program\nwas acceptable and feasible in a small sample (n=11) of depressed adolescents as well as in a pilot RCT\n(n=42) of YBI vs. an existing evidence-based treatment, group cognitive-behavioral therapy (gCBT). The RCT\nclasses were initially in-person, but we migrated to synchronous online classes due to COVID-19. In the RCT,\nparticipants within each study arm showed decreased depression symptoms and increased self-compassion\nover time. Most a priori feasibility and acceptability targets were met (e.g., recruitment, retention, expectancy,\nsatisfaction, credibility, attendance, and adherence). However, participants did not engage in home (outside-of-\nclass) practice at the targeted rate. Thus, in the present proposal we have modified our protocol to provide an\nopportunity for twice-weekly supervised yoga practice (one in-person class on the weekend, and one virtual\nclass midweek). Our prior pilot trial was based at only one site (Providence RI) with one primary YBI instructor\nand two gCBT leaders. Multiple sites and instructors/leaders, and recruitment of a more racially and ethnically\ndiverse sample, will be important to demonstrate generalizability and to enhance effectiveness. We now pro-\npose to conduct a two-phase multi-site feasibility trial. Phase 1 (n=20) will focus on increasing accessibility and\nfeasibility of YBI for particular groups of adolescents. We will conduct individual interviews with teens who were\nless represented in our pilot trial (African-American/Black, Asian American, and male adolescents) to gain their\nfeedback on yoga based interventions, with a focus on increasing accessibility and feasibility for adolescents\nwith these identities. Phase 2 (n=128) will be a pilot RCT of YBI vs. gCBT at two geographically distinct sites:\nBoston, MA and Columbus, OH. Given the rising prevalence of adolescent depression and the existence of\nestablished, efficacious group treatment for depression (i.e., group CBT), we determined that a non-inferiority\ntrial represented the most ethical way to proceed. We will incorporate lessons learned from this study to further\nrefine study materials and create a template for onboarding multiple future sites. This project will prepare us to\nconduct a multisite, adequately powered, non-inferiority RCT of YBI vs. gCBT in depressed adolescents.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Engaging People Who Use Drugs in Harm Reduction Service Delivery: An Intravention to Reduce Risk of HIV, HCV, Overdose, and Injection-related Infections in Rural Appalachia",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "The proposed project will test an innovative, peer-driven approach to address unmet harm reduction needs in\ntwo rural Kentucky counties at the epicenter of the opioid/stimulant epidemic, with the aim of reducing risk for\noverdose (OD), hepatitis C (HCV), skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), and HIV. Research has shown that\nthese counties and the encompassing rural Appalachian region have high rates of drug-related harms including\nODs, HCV, opioid use disorder, methamphetamine use, and SSTIs, and are at high risk for an HIV outbreak\namong people who inject drugs (PWID). In 2020, Kentucky was one of just seven states named in the Ending\nthe HIV Epidemic initiative based on the percentage of new HIV diagnoses occurring in rural areas. In an effort\nto reduce drug-related harms, Kentucky has opened brick-and-mortar syringe service programs (SSPs) in 65\nof its 120 counties, including those involved in this proposal. Unfortunately, this infrastructure remains vastly\nunder-utilized. Our ongoing research has shown that only 50% of PWID are using the SSP, primarily due to\nfear of being seen by someone they know, concerns around law enforcement or child protective services, and\nanticipated judgment by staff, barriers similar to those reported elsewhere in the region. State data have\nrevealed challenges with client retention, particularly in rural communities, and substantial recent declines in\nthe number of SSP clients and visits. Together, these data highlight an urgent need to address barriers to SSP\nservice utilization in rural Appalachia and expand service reach to the growing number of rural PWID with\nunmet harm reduction needs. To best overcome barriers related to privacy and fear of stigma and judgment,\nmodels must meet PWID where they are by engaging those whom they trust. For decades, scientists have\ncalled for the expansion of \u201cintravention\u201d wherein members of communities at risk are engaged in\nimplementing the interventions intended to improve their community\u2019s health. Engaging PWID who are trusted\nmembers of the community honors harm reduction principles and is critical to intravention success, as they are\nviewed as more credible, are likely to engage those most marginalized, and can intervene when and where\nrisks are highest. Research has established that intraventions are effective, yet they have been far under-\nutilized in rural communities. In response, we will partner with local PWID and agency partners to co-develop\nand tailor a peer-driven, evidence-based intravention that engages PWID as interventionists\u2019 to reach\nindividuals with unmet harm reduction needs in rural Appalachia. The adapted intravention, hereafter referred\nto as ASSIST, will address interventionists\u2019 knowledge gaps related to OD, HCV, SSTIs, and HIV risk reduction\nand equip them with harm reduction supplies for use and distribution. We will evaluate ASSIST\u2019s impact on\nsubstance use related harms and implementation outcomes using a Type 1 hybrid effectiveness study, cost-\neffectiveness analysis, and mathematical modeling. The study will advance harm reduction science and provide\nmuch needed data to inform scale up to rural communities in Appalachia and beyond.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Designing for sustainability: Co-designing and testing the efficacy of a web-based toolkit to improve cancer-related emotional distress and anxiety for rural older cancer survivors",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY: From 2019-2022, telehealth uptake in rural health clinics surged by 73%. This rapid acceleration\nin telehealth uptake was driven by COVID-19 precautions, the permanent closure of rural hospitals, a massive shortage\nof mental health professionals, and $1.5 billion in federal investment in broadband access. However, despite the\navailability and investment in telehealth, many rural patients, especially rural older adults, lack the digital literacy\nnecessary to fully utilize it, exacerbating barriers to quality healthcare and hindering the potential benefits of telehealth\nin expanding access to quality healthcare. Increasing rurality and older age are associated with lower digital literacy and\ntelehealth adoption, and rural older cancer survivors (ROCS) face compounded vulnerabilities, which are exacerbated\nby the reduced access to mental health professionals in rural areas for ROCS experiencing cancer-related distress.\nCancer-related distress is stress and anxiety related to a cancer diagnosis and treatment. Telehealth providing support\nfor cancer-related distress is a promising strategy to expand care in rural areas with a shortage of mental health\nprofessionals. Still, without interventions to address digital literacy, many ROCS will go without this critical care, thus\ncompromising their overall cancer outcomes. To this end, we developed CONNECT, a web-based toolkit targeting\ndigital literacy and mental health support for ROCS, employing a user-centered design approach and the Designing for\nDissemination and Sustainability logic model. CONNECT addresses digital literacy and supports for cancer-related\ndistress management through interactive activities for setting up telehealth visits, accessing educational materials about\ncancer-related distress, and providing individualized mental health resource recommendations. Feedback from our pilot\nusability study was positive, reporting high levels of acceptability and usability from users. Yet, additional comments\nunderscored the need to enhance the platform with opportunities to engage caregivers remotely but synchronously to\nprovide additional real-time digital literacy assistance. Building on this pilot, we propose to adapt CONNECT using a co-\ndesign process to include recommendations from our pilot, namely, functions that permit synchronous communication\nwith a caregiver (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will conduct a 2-arm randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the\nadapted CONNECT for improving cancer-related distress among ROCS. We will randomly assign ROCS-caregiver\ndyads (N=274) to a CONNECT intervention group (N=134) or enhanced standard of care (n=134). Dyads in the\nintervention group will receive usual care and engage with CONNECT. Participants in the enhanced standard of care\ngroup will receive usual care and survivorship care and cancer-related distress literature. Our primary outcome is levels\nof cancer-related distress. We will secondarily assess digital literacy and healthcare engagement, clinical care, and\nexisting social support networks every 4 months after enrollment for 12 months. In Aim 3, we will use exit interviews in\nAims 1 and 2 with a subsample of participants to examine outcomes related to implementation and potential\nsustainability in the rural multi-level context. Completing these aims will inform future integration of CONNECT across\nmultiple healthcare systems for a multi-site scaled-up effectiveness RCT.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nSignal transduction and protein phosphorylation are vital for life. The ability to respond to stimuli is\nconsidered a key characteristic of life. Cells detect new conditions, transduce relevant information into a\nusable form, and execute appropriate responses. Errors in signal transduction can cause reduced fitness or\ndisease. A common strategy is to represent information by the specific and transient placement of phosphoryl\ngroups on proteins. Many pathogens use phosphorylation to regulate virulence in response to host parameters.\nThus, understanding the mechanisms, regulation, and impact of phosphoryl group transfer among microbial\nsignaling proteins is of fundamental interest, and of practical significance to infectious diseases of humans.\nKinetics of two-component regulatory system (TCS) phosphotransfer reactions are crucial to biological\nfunction. TCSs are widely used for signal transduction by microorganisms and plants (but not humans) to\ncontrol virulence, physiology, development, behavior, etc. Sensor kinases detect stimuli and internalize input\non intracellular dimerization and histidine phosphorylation (DHp) domains using phosphoryl groups. Receiver\ndomains catalyze transfer of phosphoryl groups from sensor kinases to themselves and from themselves to\nwater to modulate response regulator output. Receiver domains can also reversibly exchange phosphoryl\ngroups with histidine-containing phosphotransfer (Hpt) domains to create more complex phosphorelays. The\nkinetics of phosphotransfer reactions are crucial to synchronize responses with stimuli and can differ by many\norders of magnitude between TCSs that control biological functions operating on different timescales.\nInnovative uses of protein sequence data to design experiments that provide insight into all TCSs. We\ndeliberately confront a key challenge arising from the genomic era - the large and increasing gap between the\nnumber of identified TCSs and the number that can reasonably be studied experimentally. Our long-term goal\nto comprehensively understand the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction in TCSs demands a\nfundamentally different and less granular approach than studying one TCS at a time. We focus on aspects of\nDHp, Hpt, and receiver domains that vary between TCSs, using bioinformatics to guide our experiments to\nunravel the factors governing TCS specialization. We will determine mechanisms and factors that modulate\nphosphotransfer reactions between DHp, Hpt, and receiver domains (AIM 1); DHp phosphatase activity (AIM\n2); and receiver domain autocatalytic reactions, which form the basis of TCS signaling (AIM 3).\nHigh impact on TCSs and beyond. TCS proteins are among the most abundant in nature. Completion of\nour Aims will help predict the properties of uncharacterized TCSs from amino acid sequence features, facilitate\nsystems and synthetic biology applications of TCSs, and potentially aid design of antibiotics that target TCSs.\nRobust predictive capability could mitigate limited experimental capacity to investigate uncharacterized TCSs.\nThe innovative bioinformatics strategies used and refined here can also guide study of any protein domain.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC) is in its 44th year as an NCI-designated\ncomprehensive cancer center, having received an \u201cexceptional\u201d overall merit descriptor in its last two reviews in\n2010 and 2015, and is requesting continued federal support for the next five years. The OSUCCC mission\nremains to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality through basic, population, translational and clinical research.\nThrough thoughtful strategic planning, attention to the cancer burden in the catchment area (the state of Ohio),\neffective organizational capabilities and targeted investment, the Director and his Senior Leadership team will\nenable the OSUCCC to advance collaborative cancer research with local, national, and global partners on\ninitiatives of the highest priority to the OSUCCC. The 293 full and introductory members are currently served by\n16 full and two developing shared resources and are distributed among our five Research Programs: Cancer\nBiology (formerly Molecular Biology and Cancer Genetics), Cancer Control, Leukemia Research, Molecular\nCarcinogenesis and Chemoprevention and Translational Therapeutics. The OSUCCC fosters collaborative basic\nresearch and implements strategies that advance and translate early discovery into clinical and population-based\nresearch and addresses the needs of our catchment area through research, engagement, and outreach, from\netiology through prevention, treatment and survivorship regarding the major cancers afflicting our catchment\narea population. The OSUCCC trains the next generation of cancer-focused scientists and clinicians through\nnew and established programs focused on integrating training for collaborative research efforts. Under the\nleadership of a new Director, Raphael Pollock, MD, PhD, The OSUCCC supports innovative research efforts\nwithin four strategic planning priorities: immuno-oncology, cancer engineering, translational genomics and\ncancer prevention and survivorship. Since the last CCSG competitive renewal, the OSUCCC has shown\nsignificant growth demonstrated by: 1) the recruitment of 108 basic, population, and translational science faculty\nwho are OSUCCC members; 2) the addition of 94,647 ft2 research and administrative space under the full control\nof the OSUCCC Director; 3) a 16% increase in direct cancer-related funding to $75.4M, with $44.3M coming\nfrom the NCI; 4) accrual of 14,996 patients to interventional clinical trials (5,648 accruals to therapeutic trials); 5)\nincreased collaborative and impactful research demonstrated by 3,477 peer-reviewed publications in which 74%\nof manuscripts are multi-institutional and 85% are collaborative (i.e., inter-, intra-programmatic or multi-\ninstitutional); 497 are published in journals with an impact factor >10; 6) the addition of two new shared resources\nat an institutional investment of $1.3M; and 7) preclinical and clinical development of an FDA approved drug\nwhich has changed the treatment for CLL and other blood cancers. With new recruits and strong institutional and\nphilanthropic support in place, the OSUCCC is building upon the momentum and poised in the next five years to\ntake significant steps toward achieving our mission and our broad vision of living in a cancer-free world.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nThe impact of genetic testing for disease prevention hinges on cascade screening, the process of\nsystematically identifying and testing relatives in families with a genetic condition. Lynch syndrome is a\ngenetic condition that confers an increased lifetime risk of cancer. Unfortunately, only half of first-degree family\nmembers with Lynch syndrome receive cascade screening, representing a missed opportunity in cancer\nprevention. Let's Talk is a novel intervention to promote and support cascade screening in families with Lynch\nsyndrome. Developed using intervention mapping, a 6-step, stakeholder-engaged methodology for developing\ntheory-based interventions, the workbook intervention addresses barriers to cascade screening through\ninformation chunking, guided practice, planning coping responses, and gain frame messaging for patients, their\nprovider and family. Preliminary data have demonstrated that the content of Let's Talk, in a paper-based\nformat, is acceptable to patients with Lynch syndrome, and all patients reported that they would recommend its\nuse to someone recently diagnosed with Lynch syndrome. In addition, all patients in our usability study\nendorsed the development of an interactive, online version, which could improve dissemination, given changes\nin genetic counseling workflows due to COVID-19, and could facilitate ongoing patient support through follow-\nup messaging. Thus, the overall objective of this project is to (1) adapt and refine an interactive online format\nfor Let's Talk based on patient preferences and user feedback, and (2) pilot test Let's Talk to assess its\nfeasibility by measuring implementation (primary) and effectiveness outcomes. The expected outcomes of this\nproject will move the field forward in tackling challenges associated with cascade screening in Lynch syndrome\nand other hereditary conditions. This work will provide foundational data for a future R01 application to test the\neffectiveness and implementation of Let's Talk for increasing cascade screening uptake and identification of\nrelatives with Lynch syndrome across diverse care settings.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Impact of Treatment of Asymptomatic Bacteriuria on Low Birth Weight",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nAsymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) in pregnancy has been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal\nmorbidity including preterm birth and low birth weight (LBW) and maternal morbidity including pyelonephritis.\nHypothesis: Treatment of pregnant individuals with AB will reduce the incidence of newborns with LBW in\nlow- and middle-income countries (LMICs).\nSignificance: LBW occurs in more than 20 million newborns each year globally and is associated with an\nincreased risk of neonatal death and lifetime morbidity. This proposal will examine the impact of treating AB\nin pregnant individuals in LMICs on the incidence of LBW and serious maternal and neonatal morbidity.\nInvestigators: Dr. Chisholm (mPI) is an academic maternal-fetal medicine subspecialist with 5 years of\nexperience as a member of the NICHD Global Network for Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Health Research (GN)\nand investigator in global clinical trials. Dr. McClure (mPI) is a perinatal epidemiologist and PI of the Data\nCoordinating Center who has more than 20 years of experience contributing to the leadership of the GN and\noverseeing research in LMICs. Co-Is Dr. Petri at the University of Virginia and Dr. Haque at the International\nCentre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh, have collaborated for 30 years on maternal\u2013child\nhealth and infectious diseases research.\nInnovation: The proposed study will address calls from the World Health Organization, USPSTF, and\nnumerous professional societies for data evaluating the impact of treatment for AB in contemporary obstetric\npopulations in LMICs where the burden of LBW and associated neonatal morbidity is highest and where the\npractice of screening for AB is less widely implemented.\nApproach: We will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-arm trial to address the\nfollowing specific aims:\nSpecific Aim 1: Test the primary outcome of the trial, which is the impact of antibiotic (nitrofurantoin)\ntreatment of AB on LBW. This will be done by comparing the incidence of LBW between those randomized\nto receive nitrofurantoin and those randomized to receive placebo.\nSpecific Aim 2: Test the secondary outcome of the trial, which is the impact of antibiotic treatment of AB on\nserious maternal morbidity in pregnancy. This will be done by comparing maternal morbidity between those\nrandomized to receive nitrofurantoin and those randomized to receive placebo. We hypothesize that\ntreatment of AB in pregnancy will reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis and pre-eclampsia.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Alcohol assoCiated gut Dysbiosis and CVD in HIV (the AC/DC HIV study)",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT ABSTRACT: Among people with HIV infection (PWH), hazardous drinking is a common, modifiable\nrisk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death. Both alcohol and HIV cause gut dysbiosis. Gut\ndysbiosis is associated with systemic inflammation and harmful metabolites, each of which is associated with\nCVD and death. However, the specific bacterial shifts that drive dysbiosis and its harmful effects among PWH\nwho drink are unclear. Our overarching model posits that alcohol associated gut dysbiosis leads to a\nreduction in specific species of butyrate-producing bacteria, lowering butyrate levels and increasing\ntrimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). These mechanisms contribute to microbial translocation and vascular\ninflammation. Ultimately, these processes promote CVD and excess mortality. This application leverages rich\nexisting data from three fully harmonized NIAAA cohort studies (ACME HIV, U01AA026222; TMAO HIV,\nR01AA025859; META HIV, P01AA029542) in response to NOT-AA-23-011 requesting proposals for use of\nexisting data and biospecimens in alcohol research. We hypothesize that alcohol associated gut dysbiosis will\nbe characterized by reductions in butyrate-producing species (Aim 1); that reductions in these species will\nassociate with increased levels of microbial translocation, inflammation, and harmful metabolites (Aim 2); and\nthat reductions in butyrate-producing species will associate with greater subclinical CVD dysfunction, CVD risk,\nand mortality risk (Aim 3). Prior studies examining alcohol associated dysbiosis in PWH are limited in\ntwo major ways: (1) they rely on 16S characterization of the gut microbiome, which cannot provide granular\n(i.e., species level) data; or (2) they employ whole genome sequencing (WGS) to collect species level data, but\nonly in small samples. Our application is innovative because it addresses both limitations by utilizing WGS in\nthree existing, fully harmonized NIAAA-funded studies involving 583 PWH who consume alcohol with >1700\nlongitudinal fecal specimens. Extant data include alcohol measures (AUDIT; Timeline Followback, TLFB;\nphosphatidyl ethanol, PEth), stored serum/plasma and fecal samples, 16S gut microbiome data, and serum\nbiomarkers for metabolites (e.g., TMAO), microbial translocation (e.g., LBP), inflammation (e.g., IL-6), VACS\nIndex (mortality) and Reynolds Risk (CVD) scores, and echocardiograms. New data to be generated are\nWGS on all fecal samples from the three studies. Specific Aims are as follows: Aim 1: To characterize\nalcohol associated dysbiosis using WGS, employing longitudinal fecal specimens. Aim 2: To test the relations\nof the gut microbiome at species/strain-level with markers of microbial translocation, inflammation, and harmful\nmetabolites. Aim 3: To test the association of species/strain-level changes in butyrate-producing and other gut\nbacteria with subclinical CVD markers, CVD risk, and mortality risk. IMPACT: Precision medicine approaches\nutilizing gut microbiota profiles at the species level can be leveraged into novel interventions to mitigate\nharmful downstream health effects of alcohol (i.e., inflammation, CVD, mortality risk) in PWH.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Molecular recognition by ADAR1 of Z-RNA within transcriptomes",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "1 Project Summary\n 2 RNA editing of cellular RNAs helps the cell distinguish between self and non-self RNAs. This\n 3 editing of adenosines into inosines is generally catalyzed by the \u2018adenosine deaminase acting on\n 4 RNA-1\u2019 protein (ADAR1). A>I editing is augmented in tumors and upon infection, primarily\n 5 through the interferon-induced longer isoform of ADAR1 that comprises a Z-DNA/Z-RNA binding\n 6 domain named \u2018Z\u03b1\u2019 at its N-terminus. Misediting is implicated in neurological diseases such as\n 7 Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome. Z-RNA in the form of repeats of cytosine and guanosine (CpG) in a\n 8 left-handed double-helical conformation has been proposed in cells, but the prevalence of such\n 9 structures and their exact role are unknown. In addition, many \u2014if not most\u2014 regions proposed\n10 to adopt a Z conformation do not resemble regular (CpG)n. How these local Z-RNA conformations\n11 are generated within A-form helices, stabilized and regulated by Z\u03b1 of ADAR1, as well as their\n12 exact role in the function of these RNAs, remain unknown. Our hypothesis is that the binding\n13 of Z\u03b1 to Z-RNA plays an essential role during the editing process. Here, we propose to\n14 answer the following questions: What is the mechanism for Z-RNA formation at CpG but also\n15 non-CpG sequences? How widespread are transitions to Z-RNA across transcriptomes? Is Z-\n16 RNA sampled in the free form or only adopted upon binding by Z\u03b1? What are the structural\n17 features of Z-RNA recognition by Z\u03b1 at non CpG sequences? We will first dynamically\n18 characterize the propensity of various sequence contexts to adopt Z-RNA conformations.\n19 This aim will use advanced NMR methods to characterize the sequence of events that lead an\n20 RNA region from A-form to Z-form. Second, we will determine the unbiased 3D structure of\n21 RNA fragments bound to Z\u03b1 in solution. Finally, we will identify and localize Z\u03b1 binding\n22 sites and Z\u03b1-dependent A>I editing events. This aim will take advantage of the robust\n23 expertise and support for next-generation sequencing on our campus and at a contracted\n24 company. Overall, our joint work as co-PIs will provide a structural rationale for the formation of\n25 Z-RNA and the resulting formation of A-Z junctions across a variety of RNAs. We ultimately aim\n26 to explain how the Z-RNA binding domain of ADAR1 increases the specificity and activity of\n27 ADAR1. Our findings will help beyond this application with proposing a comprehensive\n28 mechanism for ADAR1 editing and its RNA-mediated transcriptome-wide regulation, and\n29 contribute to understanding disease such as cancer or auto-immune deficiencies.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Precision medicine aims to accurately classify patients to improve diagnosis, intervention selection, and prognosis. The All of Us Research Program (AoURP) collects an array of data types from participants, including surveys, electronic health records (EHRs), physical measurements, wearable devices, and biosamples, offering valuable insights into health trajectories. However, certain aspects of a participant\u2019s life remain missing in the collected data, which can limit the accuracy of research and care. To address this gap, we propose the creation of the All of Us Center for Linkage and Acquisition of Data (CLAD) to supplement existing data sources using passive data streams and deploy integration strategies to \"put the patient back together again\" and more deeply assess health outcomes. This team brings together collective experience leading large initiatives involving data acquisition, linkage, harmonization, quality assurance, pipelines and platforms, governance, and security. We will design and implement a data collection, linkage, and integration strategy that lays a foundation for a variety of AoURP data linkages for identified, and de-identified data integration, including person-level linkages such as with mortality, residential history, and administrative claims, and geocoded data pipelines to enable linkages with environmental and economic data. The CLAD will acquire and process new data linkages and geocoded data in a cloud-based Data Linkage Platform (DLP), guided by our experience formulating researcher-ready datasets with scientific utility. Our CLAD team will perform data quality assurance, repair, and standardization checks to ensure accuracy and robustness of data-driven research. This endeavor will align data with interoperability standards and clinical terminologies, extend them where necessary, and create a data quality dashboard for every data change and data health check. We will also explore new methods of clinical data acquisition to mitigate data missingness by comparing data provided from recruitment sites with EHR data from Health Information Networks. CLAD data sources and novel analytical methods, such as probabilistic models, will be used to reveal patterns of care, health outcomes, and potential interventions for common, chronic, and genetic diseases.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nTuberculosis (TB) is among the leading infectious killers worldwide with over 10 million new cases and 1.5 million\ndeaths each year. Pulmonary TB, the most common form of the disease, is associated with lung injury that can\npersist beyond treatment completion. Post-TB lung disease (PTLD) is an important contributor to excess\ndisability and mortality that can affect an estimated 155 million TB survivors globally. Yet there are no known\ninterventions to prevent TB-associated lung injury and the likelihood of subsequent PTLD. The goal of this R01\nproposal is to characterize the burden, severity, and phenotypic presentation of PTLD, and its association with\ninterleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling pathways, in TB patients with and without HIV. We will leverage the ongoing NIH\nand Indian Government funded RePORT-India TB Research Consortium, a multi-site study that is prospectively\nevaluating HIV-uninfected adults with drug-sensitive TB for lung injury during and after TB treatment, by enrolling\na comparison cohort of HIV-positive drug-sensitive TB patients matched on age, sex, and smoking exposure\nwho will follow identical study protocols. Through Aim-1, we will extensively characterize and compare the\nphenotypic differences in lung injury at TB treatment initiation, its resolution during treatment, and subsequent\nPTLD between TB patients with versus without HIV using a multi-dimensional approach of pulmonary function\ntesting, respiratory health and functional status assessments, and novel lung imaging approaches. Through Aim-\n2, we will use induced sputum samples to comprehensively investigate the role of different IL-6 signaling\npathways in determining the extent of lung injury, and its resolution during TB treatment, by measuring key\nimmune, cellular, and gene expression markers, along with downstream inflammatory pathways linked to acute\nlung injury and fibrotic remodeling. This R01 application will expand upon our prior and ongoing research in India\nand generate evidence to support the design of clinical trials of host-directed therapies for selectively modulating\nIL-6 signaling pathways to improve pulmonary outcomes in TB patients with and without HIV.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nTuberculosis (TB) remains a global health emergency, responsible for 10 million new cases in 2021. Despite the\nglobal community's extensive effort to identify TB cases, 30% of the new cases were never diagnosed. Current\nefforts focus on active case finding of TB which is expensive and difficult to implement in practice. One approach\nthat can address the challenges is self-testing. Self-testing for TB has not been widely implemented to date, due\nin part to a lack of appropriate testing modalities and studies evaluating this approach. However, recent advances\nin diagnostic tools make self-testing a realistic possibility, opening a new door for patient-centered TB care.\nI propose a type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness study to evaluate the feasibility of implementing self-\ntesting for active TB. I will apply a currently available diagnostic tool \u2013 oral swab specimens for Xpert Ultra (which\nare easy to self-collect and highly sensitive but require shipping to a laboratory). I will first identify barriers to the\nimplementation of TB self-testing and refine the implementation strategies to address these barriers by using\nqualitative interviews and quantitative surveys (Aim 1). I will then perform a prospective study in six high-risk\noccupational settings in South Africa, where working-age individuals are known to rarely seek care, placing oral\nswab kits in three interventional sites and maintaining the standard of care in three control sites (Aim 2). I will\nevaluate the implementation and effectiveness of each strategy guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adopt,\nImplementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. My primary outcome will be an increase in the\nproportion of individuals receiving microbiological testing results, reflecting the acceptability and fidelity of TB\nself-testing. To achieve the aims, I will use a highly pragmatic study design in which the study team minimizes\ncontact with the study sites. This will enable me to evaluate whether the implementation of TB self-testing is\nlikely to impact case finding and improve working-aged individuals\u2019 health outcomes in a \u201creal world\u201d setting.\nCompletion of this study will generate pragmatic, preliminary data on the potential implementation and\neffectiveness of TB self-testing in high-burden settings, which if successful will justify a larger trial and if not will\ninform alternative approaches to overcoming barriers to seeking care for TB. In either case, these findings will\nmotivate a larger R01 proposal at the end of the five-year grant period and advance the field of TB self-testing.\nWhile this proposal will evaluate self-testing using an available tool, a broader goal is to conceptualize the self-\ntesting strategy in TB disease that will be applicable to future tools, thus representing a step toward improving\npatient-initiated or patient-centered TB care. The study will also serve as a vehicle for me to acquire skills in\nmixed methods study and implementation science, positioning me as a future leader in implementing patient-\ncentered TB interventions in the global health context.\n1",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Regulation of HSP70 function during heat stress tolerance",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\n The 70-kilodalton heat shock protein (HSP70) family, universally conserved across prokaryotic and\neukaryotic organisms, serves as essential molecular chaperones for maintaining protein homeostasis. They are\ncentral to the pathology of various diseases, including cancer, infectious diseases, neurodegeneration, and\ncardiovascular disorders. Beyond their established intracellular roles, HSP70 proteins also manifest in the\nextracellular space, significantly influencing cancer biology by modulating immune responses and facilitating\nmetastasis. This positions them as vital biomarkers for deciphering and potentially targeting the mechanisms\nunderlying cancer pathology. The critical involvement of HSP70 in such diverse human pathologies underscores\nthe potential of therapeutic strategies to modulate HSP70 pathways. Delving into the complex structure-function\nrelationship of HSP70 is essential for developing novel therapeutic interventions capable of addressing various\npathologies. This project aims to elucidate the intricate roles of the cytosolic HSP70, with a particular emphasis\non its underexplored structural attributes and their ramifications for cellular operations and disease pathogenesis.\nThe long-term objectives include a deeper understanding of HSP70\u2019s role in maintaining cellular integrity and\nstress response, which is crucial for developing innovative therapeutic interventions for various diseases.\nSpecifically, the research will concentrate on HSP70\u2019s lectin-like capacity to bind O-GlcNAcylated proteins, its\nability to bind calcium/calmodulin, and its extracellular functions. These functionalities are hypothesized to be\npivotal in modulating cellular thermoresistance and stress responses and potentially influencing the onset and\nprogression of various diseases. The chosen model system for this investigation is Arabidopsis cytosolic HSP70\n(AtHSP70), selected for its significant homology to human HSP70 isoforms and its established role in conferring\nheat stress resilience in plants. This model provides a robust framework for dissecting the conserved\nmechanisms of HSP70 function relevant to human health, thus directly aligning with the mission of improving the\nunderstanding and treatment of human diseases. To achieve these aims, the project will employ cutting-edge\ntechniques such as proximity labeling with TurboID to identify novel protein interactions in vivo and lectin weak\naffinity chromatography to characterize the interaction between HSP70 and glycosylated proteins. Through a\ndetailed examination of these interactions, the project seeks to expand the current understanding of HSP70\u2019s\nintracellular and extracellular functions and uncover potential therapeutic targets within the HSP70 pathway. By\nrevealing how alterations in HSP70\u2019s interactions with carbohydrates and Ca2+/CaM can influence disease\nmechanisms, the research aims to open new avenues for developing therapies that modulate these pathways.\nIn essence, this project embodies a strategic approach to bridging fundamental biological research with potential\nclinical applications, thereby underscoring its relevance to the overarching goal of advancing human health by\ntargeting the molecular bases of disease.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Regulation of Neurodegeneration by Nonpathogenic Cellular Prion Protein and LRP1",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Microglial activation and neuro-inflammation regulate disease progression in diverse neurodegenerative di-\nseases (NDs), including but not limited to Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Tauopathies. Under-\nstanding pathways that regulate neuro-inflammation in NDs is a significant goal. Cellular Prion Protein (PrPC) is\nbest known as a GPI-anchored membrane protein that, in rare circumstances, undergoes conformational change\nto generate a derivative that aggregates in the brain, causing rapid ND and death. Pathogenic PrPC is trans-\nmissible. Non-pathogenic PrPC is expressed widely, inside and outside the CNS. Numerous studies in diverse\nmouse model systems have shown that PrPC attenuates inflammatory responses, including neuro-inflammation.\nWe contributed to this field by identifying a system of receptors that mediates the anti-inflammatory activity of\nPrPC in macrophages when PrPC is released from cells by ADAM family proteases (S-PrP) or in exosomes and\nother extracellular vesicles (EVs). This receptor system includes LDL Receptor-related Protein-1 (LRP1) and\nthe NMDA Receptor (NMDA-R). Binding of PrPC derivatives to the LRP1/NMDA-R receptor assembly in mac-\nrophages blocks pro-inflammatory responses initiated by diverse Pattern Recognition Receptors. We now have\ndata showing that the PrPC-LRP1/NMDA-R interaction initiates anti-inflammatory cell-signaling in microglia. We\nalso have shown that the anti-inflammatory activity of S-PrP may be harnessed in small synthetic peptides (14-\nmers, 4-mer) corresponding to a putative LRP1-binding motif in PrPC that includes Lys100 and Lys103. The major\ngoal of this research project is to characterize the activity of PrPC and the LRP1/NMDA-R receptor system in\nneuro-inflammation in NDs. A second goal is to test whether PrPC derivatives may be administered therapeu-\ntically to amplify the activity of the microglial LRP1/NMDA-R system and thereby attenuate neuro-inflammation.\nThree specific aims are proposed. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the ability of anti-inflammatory PrPC derivatives\nto regulate microglial activation and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators by microglia and astrocytes in res-\nponse to proteins that accumulate and aggregate in the extracellular spaces of the CNS in various NDs, including\namyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), microtubule-associated protein Tau, and \u03b1-synuclein. In Specific Aim 2, the effects of PrPC gene\n(Prnp) deletion on biomarkers of microglial activation and neuro-inflammation will be studied in three distinct\nmouse models of ND, including AppNL-F mice, P301S-Tau transgenic mice, and mice that receive intracerebral\ninjections of \u03b1-synuclein pre-formed fibrils. In Specific Aim 3, we will replicate the studies proposed in Specific\nAim 2, studying tga20 mice, which express 3-4\u00d7 more PrPC in the CNS compared with wild-type mice. Next, we\nwill exploit the known ability of LRP1 to serve as a Blood-Brain Barrier Trojan Horse-receptor that transports\nproteins into the CNS and test whether systemically administered PrPC-derived proteins and peptides augment\nthe anti-inflammatory activity of the microglial LRP1/NMDA-R receptor system in the CNS. Collectively, these\nstudies will elucidate a novel anti-inflammatory system that may be highly significant in diverse NDs.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract\nCoxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen that grows within a lysosome-derived vacuole.\nThe formation of a replication-permissive vacuole by C. burnetii requires a type IVB secretion system called\nDot/Icm, and the >130 effector proteins delivered by this system into the host cell. While it is established that\nthe collective activities of these effector proteins remodel host signaling networks to create a replication-\npermissive environment, the molecular targets and biochemical mechanisms of most of these effectors are not\nknown. My studies have established that C. burnetii inhibits the activation of the host RIG-I pathway, a\ncytosolic double-stranded RNA sensing pathway, and that this process requires two effectors, EmcA and\nEmcB. Although these proteins do not have predicted sequence or structural homology that would indicate\npossible biochemical functions, we established that EmcB has cysteine deubiquitinase activity. EmcB directly\ntargets RIG-I and preferentially cleaves long, K63-linked ubiquitin chains that are potent activators of RIG-I\nsignaling. The goal of this study is to determine how EmcB functions to cleave ubiquitin chains from RIG-I\nduring infection and identify how C. burnetii infection is sensed by RIG-I. To achieve this goal, I will use\nbiochemical assays, pull-down experiments, and infection studies using a newly engineered emcA, emcB\ndouble mutant to determine how EmcB functions to inhibit the RIG-I pathway during infection (Aim 1). Next, I\nwill identify the specific RNAs sensed by RIG-I during C. burnetii infection and test the relative capacity of\nthese RNAs to activate the RIG-I pathway (Aim 2). Together, these studies will enhance our understanding of\nhow intracellular bacterial pathogens modulate host signaling networks for productive infection. By\nunderstanding the molecular details of how an intracellular pathogen modulates host processes, fundamental\ndetails of C. burnetii infection will be uncovered which could provide insights that lead to improved treatments.\nThese studies will be complemented by a rigorous and comprehensive program of professional training, clinical\ntraining, and scientific skill building to provide preparations necessary to pursue a career as a physician-\nscientist investigating molecular mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nAdverse pregnancy outcomes are a global issue that affects more than 50 million people per year. Infections\nduring gestation contribute significantly to adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth and neonatal\nsepsis. Streptococcus agalactiae or Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of ascending vaginal and\nintrauterine infection during pregnancy. To initiate infection, GBS must colonize the vagina and initiate a robust\nbiofilm to turn the vaginal mucosa into a replicative niche. Subsequently, GBS ascends the reproductive tract in\nan undefined process to invade the gestational membranes, cross the placenta, and infect the amniotic cavity\nand the fetus. Currently, there is no commercially available vaccine against GBS to prevent its cognate disease\noutcomes. However, epidemiological data has indicated that exposure to maternal breast milk is associated with\nprotection against GBS infection of the neonate. We have new and exciting data to suggest that components of\nhuman breast milk, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), have antibiofilm activity against GBS. Given\nthis, we hypothesize that treatment with HMOs could lead to decreased GBS biofilm formation, colonization,\ninvasive infection cognate inflammation, microbiome disruption, and disease progression. We will test this by\ndetermining the contribution of HMOs on bacterial and immunological responses in primary human placental\nmacrophages, an organ-on-a-chip infection model, ex vivo gestational membrane model, vaginal tissue models\nand a mouse model of infection during pregnancy. This work will help us establish the efficacy of deployment of\nprebiotic HMOs as a cost-effective dietary or chemotherapeutic strategy against GBS which may improve\npregnancy outcomes in vulnerable groups.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Impact of benzalkonium chloride on gut microbiome and gut-liver interactions",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Benzalkonium chlorides (BACs) are widely used antimicrobials in disinfecting products, medical products, and\nfood processing industries, suggesting humans may be exposed chronically to BACs through various routes.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to greatly increased use of disinfectants, resulting in a 174% increase\nin median BAC levels in human blood. We recently analyzed 15 de-identified human fecal samples collected\nduring COVID-19 and detected BACs in all of them, ranging from 55 nM to 2.74 \u00b5M (a 50-fold difference). BACs\nare potent antimicrobials, but their effect on the gut microbiome has not been examined, which is the major gap\nthat this proposal aims to fill. Our goal is to characterize the effect of BAC exposure on gut microbiome compo-\nsition and function, microbiota metabolism, and altered liver metabolism via the gut-liver axis. We previously\nreported that BACs are metabolized by human cytochromes P450 (CYP) in the liver. Our preliminary data sup-\nport biliary excretion from the liver to the intestine being the major route of elimination for BACs. Thus, exposure\nof gut microbiome to BACs is inevitable regardless of the route of exposure. Disruption of the gut microbiome\ncan lead to changes in endogenous and xenobiotic metabolism through modulating the ligand availability for the\nbile acid-sensing farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the lipid-sensing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha\n(PPARa), and xenobiotic-sensing constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR). Im-\nportantly, in a preliminary study, we found that BAC exposure in mice significantly upregulated the expression of\nCyp2c38, Cyp2j6, Cyp4a10, and Cyp4f13 in the liver, which is consistent with the inhibition of CAR and/or acti-\nvation of PPARa. Thus, we hypothesize that BACs reduce gut microbiome diversity and alter the metabolism of\nxenobiotics, bile acids, sterols, and lipids in the liver by modulating the activities of nuclear receptors. In Aim 1,\nwe will characterize the impact of BAC exposure at different doses and exposure regimes on gut microbiome\ndiversity and function in mice. We will then correlate the changes in microbiome functional genes with the\nchanges in the gut bile acid, sterol, and lipid profiles. In Aim 2, we will measure the effect of BAC exposure on\nbile acid, sterol, lipid, and xenobiotic metabolism in the liver of conventional and germ-free mice. Relationships\nbetween bile acid, sterol, and lipid profiles and relevant gene expression levels in the liver will be evaluated.\nActivation or inhibition of nuclear receptors regulating xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) will be as-\nsessed. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the relationship between BAC levels and gut microbiome diversity and function\nin humans. The significance of this project lies in that it will allow us to begin to understand the impact of in-\ncreased BAC exposure on gut microbiome and gut-liver interactions in humans. The innovation of this project\nlies in that a) it represents the first study to examine the impact of BAC exposure on gut-liver interactions, and\nb) alteration of XME gene expression by BAC exposure represents a novel gene-environment interaction that\ncould affect the metabolism of endogenous metabolites and other xenobiotics.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nOur goal is to develop a first-in-class oral peptide inhibitor for the treatment and prevention of gingivitis and\nperiodontitis. Oral infection by P. gingivalis leads to inflammation and bleeding of the gums, called gingivitis,\nand eventually bone and tooth loss, called periodontitis3. Almost 50% of adults worldwide over the age of thirty\nhave periodontal disease, making it one of the most common infections in humans11, 72. P. gingivalis infection is\nalso closely associated with several other chronic health conditions, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\ncardiovascular disease, cancer, and arthritis9, 12-16, 27.\nP. gingivalis is considered a causative species in periodontitis that can function to shape the overall microbial\ncommunity leading to dysbiosis and tissue damage4-7. Clinical research has confirmed that initial P. gingivalis\ncolonization occurs outside the subgingival pocket38-40. P. gingivalis adheres efficiently to supragingival\nbacteria such as commensal streptococci32-34. This adherence modulates the pathogenic potential of P.\ngingivalis and drives colonization35-37. Thus, inhibiting the adherence of P. gingivalis to supragingival bacteria\nrepresents an excellent approach to reducing and preventing periodontitis.\nOur project team originally discovered that initial colonization of the oral cavity by P. gingivalis is mediated by\nthe minor fimbrial antigen Mfa1 of P. gingivalis binding to the surface antigen SspB of Streptococcus gordonii32,\n42-44. Subsequently, we identified a domain in SspB essential to this binding45, 46. A synthetic peptide derived\nfrom this region functions as a potent inhibitor of P. gingivalis adherence and formation of biofilms45, 46. In\naddition, the synthetic peptide demonstrates inhibition of P. gingivalis virulence by preventing colonization and\nsubsequent alveolar bone loss in mouse models of severe periodontitis35.\nBuilding from this innovative work, our objective is to advance this first-in-class, cyclic peptide (called VTC-880)\ntowards the clinic for the treatment and prevention of gingivitis and periodontitis. The key aims of this proposal\nare to: 1) manufacture VTC-880 and establish potency and analytical assays, 2) determine the optimal\nformulation and in vitro PK of VTC-880 in human saliva, 3) establish the oral PK and optimal effective dose\nfor VTC-880 in mice, 4) generate acute toxicology profiles for VTC-880 in mice and in a human saliva biofilm\nmodel, and 5) finalize our IND-enabling and clinical study plan to advance VTC-880 into a clinical study.",

This conference represents the most comprehensive gathering of environmental exposure\nscientists and environmental health professionals from academia, government, and organizations from\naround the world, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the field. The theme of the 34th ISES Annual\nMeeting is \u201cExposures that Impact Health in Vulnerable Populations\u201d. The 2024 conference will focus\non new and emerging environmental health challenges for humans and the ecosystem. Environmental\nexposures may affect human health and the ecosystem in complex and non-linear ways. Exposure and\nhealth issues also vary between local, regional, and global scales. Understanding the complex nature of\nenvironmental exposures, the health impacts, and relevant strategies and policies to improve environmental\nhealth requires the knowledge, analytical methods, and data collection tools developed from multiple\ndisciplines and applied at different scales. 2024 Meeting topics include application of sensors in exposure\nassessment, citizen science and community-engaged research, climate change impacts on human\nexposure, COVID-19, vulnerabilities in environmental exposure and health, new and emerging environmental\nexposures, exposure data to policy action and impacts of public health policy, multiple exposures and\ninteractions, risk communication, statistical methods in exposure science and epidemiology, and\ntechnology/sensors among others. There will be an added focus on environmental justice and\ncommunity engaged research as it relates to the field of exposure science. The 34th ISES annual\nconference will be held in Montreal, Canada from October 20 - 24 , 2024 and will continue the success of\nprevious meetings. The meeting offers four and half days of cross-disciplinary presentations and discussions\nof new research and methods of international, national, and regional significance and facilitates the exchange\nof information and ideas among exposure science and environmental health scientists from academia,\ngovernment agencies, non-profit organizations, and industry. Conference attendance is expected to be\nbetween 500-600 participants from North America, Europe, and Asia. ISES has encouraged attendance of\nstudents and new researchers, as well as investigators from low- and middle-income countries over the last\n6 years resulting in an average of 15% increase in the number of attendees. This proposal will support the\nrepresentation of students and new researchers from underrepresented backgrounds as well as provide an\nopportunity for participation of community members, hence enhancing member diversity, promoting the\nglobal development of exposure science, and fostering collaborations and information exchange both\nnationally and internationally.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Examination of epigenetic spatial architecture in the CNS as a method to understand cocaine relapse in ecoHIV infected mice",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "This proposal seeks to develop a new imaging pipeline that will examine tissue level and nuclear level\nspatial architecture of histone dopaminylation in the CNS of ecoHIV infected mice allowed to self\nadminister cocaine. To achieve this goal we will develop a new imaging pipeline that that collects large\nnumbers of images (>15,000 per animal and brain region) and analyzes them using a novel AI-powered,\nmachine learning approach.\n Substance use disorders (SUD) are a chronic disease of the CNS that are characterized by compulsive\ncraving that persists even after substance use ceases. The development of SUD is associated with a transition\nin brain physiology that maintains drug seeking and taking. Epigenetics, the change in gene expression without\nchange to DNA sequence, and the underlying mechanisms of histone modification, transcription factor\nrecruitment and DNA packaging, is involved in an array of neurodegenerative diseases, including control of HIV\ntranscription. Furthermore, there is evidence that substance use drives changes in chromatin structure and\ntherefore may alter gene expression, and that these changes may play a role in relapse to drug use. Recent\nstudies have shown that dopamine can modify histones of cells in the CNS and that dopaminylation drives\ncocaine seeking behavior in rodents. Techniques that can connect the available powerful single cell molecular\napproaches and gross examination of the CNS by both traditional histology and modern non-invasive imaging\nfor the study of HIV and substance use have not been used extensively. We propose to address this technical\nshortcoming by combining our strengths in epigenetics, high resolution imaging of the CNS, computational\nbiology and animal behavior. We will query sub-nuclear and tissue region architecture of epigenetic\nmodifications, including the newly discovered dopaminylation of histone H3 (H3Q5dop), analyze the resulting\ndata using a machine learning based pipeline, and then correlate this architecture to behavioral outcomes as\nthey relate to drug seeking behavior. In addition to the creation and testing of new technologies, we will address\nthe hypothesis that altered dopaminylation of histones in astrocytes is the mechanism by which HIV infection\nenhances sensitivity to cocaine\u2019s neurobehavioral properties. We develop our technology in the R61 exploratory\nphase (Aim 1: Imaging of H3Q5dop and other epigenetic marks in nuclei isolated from mice self-administering\ncocaine, Aim 2: Assess applicability of tissue clearing protocols to whole-tissue imaging of histone modification,\nAim 3: Determine applicability of NUCLEO-M and tissue clearing microscopy to existing tissue bank samples)\nand fully test our behavioral hypothesis in the R33 application phase (Aim 4: Assess the independent and\ninteractive effects of cocaine exposure on nuclear architecture in a model of HIV infection, Aim 5: Determine the\ncontribution of dopaminylation to the regulation of cocaine seeking in a mouse model of HIV infection)",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Molecular recognition by ADAR1 of Z-RNA within transcriptomes",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nRNA editing of cellular RNAs helps the cell distinguish between self and non-self RNAs. This\nediting of adenosines into inosines is generally catalyzed by the `adenosine deaminase acting on\nRNA-1' protein (ADAR1). A>I editing is augmented in tumors and upon infection, primarily\nthrough the interferon-induced longer isoform of ADAR1 that comprises a Z-DNA/Z-RNA binding\ndomain named \u2018Z\u03b1\u2019 at its N-terminus. Misediting is implicated in neurological diseases such as\nAicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome. Z-RNA in the form of repeats of cytosine and guanosine (CpG) in a\nleft-handed double-helical conformation has been proposed in cells, but the prevalence of such\nstructures and their exact role are unknown. In addition, many \u2014if not most\u2014 regions proposed\nto adopt a Z conformation do not resemble regular (CpG)n. How these local Z-RNA conformations\nare generated within A-form helices, stabilized and regulated by Z\u03b1 of ADAR1, as well as their\nexact role in the function of these RNAs, remain unknown. Our hypothesis is that the binding\nof Z\u03b1 to Z-RNA plays an essential role during the editing process. Here, we propose to\nanswer the following questions: What is the mechanism for Z-RNA formation at CpG but also\nnon-CpG sequences? How widespread are transitions to Z-RNA across transcriptomes? Is Z-\nRNA sampled in the free form or only adopted upon binding by Z\u03b1? What are the structural\nfeatures of Z-RNA recognition by Z\u03b1 at non CpG sequences? We will first dynamically\ncharacterize the propensity of various sequence contexts to adopt Z-RNA conformations.\nThis aim will use advanced NMR methods to characterize the sequence of events that lead an\nRNA region from A-form to Z-form. Second, we will determine the unbiased 3D structure of\nRNA fragments bound to Z\u03b1 in solution. Finally, we will identify and localize Z\u03b1 binding\nsites and Z\u03b1-dependent A>I editing events. This aim will take advantage of the robust\nexpertise and support for next-generation sequencing on our campus and at a contracted\ncompany. Overall, our joint work as co-PIs will provide a structural rationale for the formation of\nZ-RNA and the resulting formation of A-Z junctions across a variety of RNAs. We ultimately aim\nto explain how the Z-RNA binding domain of ADAR1 increases the specificity and activity of\nADAR1. Our findings will help beyond this application with proposing a comprehensive\nmechanism for ADAR1 editing and its RNA-mediated transcriptome-wide regulation, and\ncontribute to understanding disease such as cancer or auto-immune deficiencies.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Rescuing myelination in viral infections of the juvenile brain",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nViruses are well-established causes of central nervous system (CNS) disease in the most vulnerable\npopulations, particularly in the young and immunocompromised. During CNS infection, the immune\nresponse can inadvertently cause neuropathology, resulting in neuronal death and demyelination.\nMouse models of viral infection have served as a valuable tool for dissecting mechanisms of\ndemyelinating disease in the adult brain, and a rich body of literature has revealed a complex role for\nthe immune response in demyelination. However, we know little about how viruses disrupt myelination\nin childhood, when both neurons, oligodendrocytes (OLs), and immune cells are actively maturing.\nThus, true myelin restoration remains an elusive therapeutic goal in demyelinating diseases at all ages.\nThe long-term goal is to identify mechanisms to support the preservation and repair of brain cells in the\nvery young. The overall objective of this project is to evaluate the response of oligodendrocyte\nprecursor cells (OPCs), which ultimately give rise to myelinating OLs, during a viral infection in the\ndeveloping brain. Using a juvenile mouse model of neuron-restricted virus infection, where OPCs/OLs\nare bystanders to the antiviral immune response, we have found that OPCs expand dramatically during\ninfection, and infiltrating adaptive immune cells are primary drivers of this OPC response. The general\nhypothesis is that OPCs are spurred to proliferate by infiltrating B cells during a juvenile infection, but\nthat full-fledged OPC differentiation is ultimately impeded by virally-infected neurons. The general\nhypothesis will be tested via the following the specific aims: (1) determine the protective role of juvenile\nimmune cells in promoting OPC proliferation; and (2) define the role of OPC maturation in recovery\nfrom demyelination during a juvenile infection. In Aim 1, we will use genetic and molecular approaches\nto define how OPC proliferation and maturation are regulated by subsets of B cells over the course of a\njuvenile infection. In aim 2, we will assess how virally-infected neurons regulate the differentiation of\nnewly-generated OPCs using in vivo and in vitro approaches. The expected outcomes are that we will\ndefine cellular and molecular interactions that direct OPC fate during a juvenile viral infection.\nCollectively, these results are expected to have a significant impact by providing a basis for the\ndevelopment of therapies to preserve or restore myelination in the young brain. This research aligns\nwith NIND's mission by generating fundamental insights into interactions between the brain and\nimmune cells, and by applying that new knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease in the\nmost vulnerable populations.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "A Growing Crisis of Novel Injection-Related Wounds and Skin & Soft Tissue Infections among People Who Inject Drugs: A Community-Based, Longitudinal Investigation in North Carolina",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nWe propose a community-based, longitudinal, mixed-methods study to investigate the growing crisis of\ninjection-related wounds and skin and soft tissue infections (IWSSTIs) among people who inject drugs\n(PWID) in the United States. Lost among the data on skyrocketing overdose deaths is an alarming increase\nin the prevalence and severity of novel IWSSTIs. IWSSTIs are a leading cause of morbidity for PWID and\nthe most common cause of hospitalizations. More than 100,000 IWSSTIs have occurred annually since\n2018. When left untreated, IWSSTIs can become septic, gangrene, and progress to catastrophic infections\nthat require complicated surgeries and long-term medical care. IWSSTIs can stress hospital systems\nalready overburdened with COVID-19, consume limited Medicaid funding, and increase stigma toward\nPWID. While IWSSTIs have been a concern for PWID for decades, rising incidence of dermal reactions and\nantinociceptive effects from synthetic drugs and novel psychoactive substances (NPS) represents a new\nand emerging public health crisis. The Office of National Drug Control Policy recently listed xylazine as an\nemerging threat and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned of xylazine\u2019s growing\ninvolvement in fentanyl overdose deaths. Aim 1: To observe, examine, and typologize IWSSTIs by DSS\nfactors through Consensus-based Clinical Case Reporting Guideline Development (CARE)26-informed case\nreports, ethnographic interviews, and community-based drug checking among a qualitative sample of 30\nPWID (15/site) in western NC; Aim 2: To examine associations between DSS factors and IWSSTI risk\namong a longitudinal cohort of PWID in NC (N = 450). To achieve these aims, we will recruit PWID from\nSSPs, homeless encampments, motels, and other places where PWID reside and congregate at the two\nstudy sites and surrounding counties (see Facilities). Aim 1 will be accomplished using targeted sampling\nmethods and Aim 2 will be accomplished using respondent-driven sampling (RDS). The study will be led by\nPrincipal Investigator Jon Zibbell, a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)\u2013funded behavioral scientist\nwith many years of experience studying injection drug use and infectious disease risk among PWID. The\nteam also includes William Zule, a NIDA-funded epidemiologist; Arnie Aldridge, a National Institutes of\nHealth\u2013funded statistician; Asher Schranz, a physician and medical expert in injection-related infectious\ndiseases; and Sarah Duhart Clarke, an applied psychologist. Findings from the proposed study will help\ncharacterize the etiology and unique features of IWSSTs by DSS factors and quantify xylazine prevalence\nin the illicit drug supply in western NC. Because growing xylazine contamination and sharp growth in novel\nIWSSTIs among PWID together comprise an emerging crisis, these data are time sensitive, and the\nproposed study is poised to make a timely and effective contribution to inform public health response.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "mSaada: A Mobile Health Tool to Improve Cervical Cancer Screening in western Kenya",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nCervical cancer is the most common cancer among women in many low- and middle-income countries,\nincluding Kenya. This is mainly due to the lack of screening, which remains the cornerstone of prevention for\nthe over one hundred million reproductive-aged women who fall outside the target age group or live in\ncountries where the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is not available. While HPV-based screening has\nthe potential to be incorporated into simplified protocols, the laboratory testing component requires programs to\nhave capacity to track specimens, results and patient follow-up, which can be a challenge in settings with\nlimited healthcare infrastructure and no electronic medical records. Further, low baseline knowledge of HPV\nand cervical cancer risk in the community is associated with low rates of screening and follow-up, making\neffective outreach and education a key component of screening programs. This work is often done by\ncommunity health volunteers (CHVs) with limited content-specific training. We propose to fill these gaps\nthrough an integrated digital platform that includes a mobile app (mSaada) that supports CHVs with patient and\nspecimen tracking and follow-up, and counseling and protocol support. In the R21 phase of this project, we will:\n(1) work with key stakeholders and local and international developers to finalize the mSaada platform, building\non the existing prototype to add patient and specimen tracking functionality; and (2) carry out a pilot study to\nidentify the patient, provider and health system factors necessary to design a trial to evaluate mSaada\neffectiveness and implementation factors. We will carry out a six-month pilot in two health facilities providing\nHPV-based screening, and use performance metrics including system usage rates, workflow observations and\nqualitative data to guide the planning of a cluster-randomized clinical trial (c-RCT) to determine effectiveness of\nmSaada. In the R33 phase of the project, we will use a hybrid implementation effectiveness design to: (1)\nconduct an 18-month c-RCT across 12 health facilities to determine the impact of mSaada on cervical cancer\nscreening uptake, treatment acquisition and cervical cancer knowledge levels among women in the community;\nand (2) measure the requisite implementation factors for mSaada effectiveness, sustainability, and scale-up.\nThe rigorous study design will allow us to determine the clinical impact of mSaada, ensure the local and\nregional infrastructure has the capacity necessary for sustainability and develop strategies for widespread\nimplementation and scale-up. Collaboration with key stakeholders from the Kenya Ministry of Health will\nfacilitate the development of a long-term sustainability plan as the country moves toward HPV-based cervical\ncancer screening.

These efforts are a clear continuation and extension of CANA\u2019s work and\nmission, critical for mental health (e.g., depression and anxiety), physical health (e.g., chronic\nillnesses such as hypertension, diabetes) and economic well-being of our families and\ncommunity in a post COVID-19 recovery environment. Central to this collaborative plan is a\ncommunity-based participatory action research approach with local Latino laborers, domestic\nworkers, and cultural producers, in collaboration with professional health services researchers\nat UCSF, whose goal together is to identify the relationship between systemic inequities, racial\ndisparities, and physical and mental health outcomes. CANA and its partners will utilize this\nresearch as part of the NIH Common Fund launched by the Community Partnerships to\nAdvance Science for Society, and to create and implement a multi-platform COVID-19 recovery\nplan and community revitalization for Latino, Indigenous, and Black residents of San Francisco\u2019s\nMission District that brings opportunities for all to thrive through community revitalization and\nstructural interventions focused on home ownership, food access, bilingual health and wellness,\nand economic workforce development.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary: Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia. Therapies aim to\ncontrol risk factors (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus) to prevent development or\nworsening of disease. Recent studies show that viral infections are potentially modifiable risk factors for\ndementia. Amongst all pathogens, varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the most likely contributor to vascular\ndementia. VZV is a neurotropic DNA virus that is latent in >95% of Americans and reactivates to produce\nherpes zoster (shingles) in 50% by 85 years of age. Despite the availability of zoster vaccines, there are still >1\nmil cases of zoster annually. Recent studies reveal zoster increases dementia risk and treatment (vaccines,\nantivirals) reduces risk. Importantly, a recent FinnGen and U.K. biobank study showed VZV was specifically\nassociated with an increased risk of vascular dementia. VZV likely contributes to vascular dementia risk\nthrough its well-established ability to produce vascular pathology leading to ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke\n(VZV vasculopathy). VZV directly infects cerebral arteries and causes a vasculitis, as well as induces a\nprothrombotic state triggering cerebral thrombosis. A notable feature is the involvement of soluble factors that\npromote vasculitis or thrombosis distal from the site of rash. We recently showed that plasma exosomes\nisolated from acute zoster patients contained significantly elevated prothrombotic and proinflammatory proteins\nincluding thrombospondin-1, caveolae-associated protein 2, coagulation factors V and XIIIA1, calmodulin 1,\nand transthyretin compared to matched controls. These exosomes were non-infectious but induced IL-6 and\nIL-8 secretion when applied to na\u00efve primary human brain vascular adventitial fibroblasts, activated donor\nplatelets, and induced platelet-leukocyte aggregations supporting a proinflammatory and prothrombotic state.\nImportantly, these exosomes persist for at least 3 months post-zoster, well after rash clearance and detectable\nviremia. Overall, we hypothesize that circulating exosomes during zoster and in subsequent months will\npromote vasculitis and thrombosis, thus providing a mechanistic basis for the increased vascular dysfunction\nrisk preceding vascular dementia. To test this hypothesis, we will isolate plasma exosomes from individuals\nduring acute zoster and at 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-zoster, as well as isolate\nexosomes from matched control individuals during a single clinic visit. Aim 1 will analyze exosome content for\nknown vascular damaging proteins/miRNAs from matched control and zoster individuals over a 12-month\nperiod. Aim 2 will determine the mechanism(s) in which non-infectious zoster exosomes promote vascular\ndysfunction. Understanding how long-lasting pathogenic exosomes promote cerebrovascular disease during\nand after zoster, thereby accelerating vascular dementia risk, is significant because it will potentially change\nclinical practice with regards to duration of antiviral therapy and use of anti-platelet agents for zoster, as well as\nincrease support for vaccination to prevent rash and stroke, as well as to decrease vascular dementia risk.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\n Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) prevalence is rising globally and live biotherapeutic products (LBPs)\nhave shown some success in relieving the symptoms of IBD. However, LBP efficacy has been limited in part due\nto inadequate engraftment and colonization. Novel technologies are needed to identify and address the factors\nlimiting the engraftment and efficacy of LBPs in the clinic. Lytic and lysogenic phage predation has the potential\nto inhibit the colonization of LBP strains and obstruct their engraftment. Bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems, while\nextensively used for genome engineering, provide adaptive immunity against phage predation by degrading\nforeign DNA in a programmable and sequence specific manner. Thus, the addition of a rationally designed\nCRISPR-Cas system to an LBP can provide phage immunity and support bacterial survival in the presence of\nphage predation. Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is an LBP with a long history of human use for a variety of\napplications, including treatment of UC and as a chassis for the delivery of therapeutic payloads. However, like\nmost LBPs, EcN variably engrafts in patients, which can limit its utility in the clinic. We have identified and isolated\nEcN phages from stool samples of patients with UC, and further validated the existence of these phages in in\nvitro experiments. This work suggests that these phages could directly prevent the survival and efficacy\nof this therapeutically significant strain in the clinic.\n Ancilia Bioscience\u2019s long-term goal is to harness CRISPR\u2019s natural function to develop a new class of\nLBPs with enhanced engraftment and therapeutic efficacy. The overall objective of this proposal is to improve\nEcN colonization in the presence of phage. Our central hypothesis is that phages can directly prevent the\ntherapeutic efficacy of LBPs. By strategically engineering CRISPR, we can immunize EcN to robustly colonize\nthe intestinal tract and increase bacterial engraftment. This proposal aims to investigate phage immunity as a\nmethod to augment EcN therapeutic efficacy and fitness in the context of IBD. These studies will be executed\nby Ancilia Biosciences through collaborations with Dr. Rodolphe Barrangou, Todd R. Klaenhammer\nDistinguished Professor at NC State University, and Dr. Casey Theriot, Associate Professor in Infectious\nDisease at NC State University. Furthermore, we expect these results to establish the feasibility of engineering\nCRISPR-Cas immunity for improved bacterial engraftment to enable the therapeutic efficacy and\ncommercialization of LBPs for a range of applications.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "SUMMARY\n Long-term protection from viral infections is mediated by both the humoral and cellular immune pathways.\nMultiple Myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy in the US and is characterized\nby clonal plasma cell production, resulting in immune suppression and recurrent bacterial and viral infections.\n SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody quantification are currently being used as clinical endpoints to determine\nimmune protection against COVID-19, and this information is even more relevant in immunocompromised\nindividuals who lack a humoral response, but are protected by the cellular immunity (i.e. MM patients).\n Despite the urgent need to quantify cellular immunity, the complexity and lack of scalability of traditional\nmethods (e.g. ELISpot, flow cytometry) to detect antigen-specific T cells has so far prevented large scale studies.\n To address this problem, we developed a direct qPCR-based rapid T cell activation (dqTACT) assay based\non ex vivo stimulation of whole blood samples with a pool of viral peptides (i.e.immunodominant peptides\ncovering SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein),\nSARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific T cells, and CXCL10,\nfollowed by direct amplification of IFNG \ud835\udefe or IL2 which are produced by\n which is produced by monocytes and neutrophils in\n,\nresponse\nto\nT cell activation.\nThe overarching aim of this proposal is to develop and implement a qPCR method that can be used as a proxy\nto measure the presence and functionality of antigen specific T cells in MM patients. Specifically, we hypothesize\nthat SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells might be a biomarker of previous infection and of efficacy of vaccination\nstrategies, complementary to quantification of the humoral response.\n In the UH2 phase, we will define analytical sensitivity and specificity and establish cut-off/thresholds and\nappropriate positive and quality controls, accuracy and false result rate by comparing the dqTACT assay with\nthe gold standard assays such as flow cytometry and ELISpot for measuring cellular immune responses.\n In the UH3 phase, we will test the presence and persistence of cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in\nconvalescent and vaccinated myeloma patients. Well annotated patient populations will be used to define\nsensitivity, specificity, and thresholds with response to clinical end-points, such as presence and persistence of\nhumoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2. We will estimate the prevalence of the markers within vaccinated\nmyeloma patients. We will then extend our studies and use banked as well as fresh samples from our large\nmyeloma/immunocompromised population and healthy controls enrolled in IRB approved studies.\n The overarching goal is to use the dqTACT assay to test the presence of T cells due to natural infection or\nvaccination in myeloma patients, possibly aiding in nationwide booster strategies or passive antibody infusion\nsupport to protect these vulnerable population.\n Key deliverables an assay to rapidly quantify the functionality of T cellular immunity at scale.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract\nX-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for determining the atomic positions of proteins, used by researchers at\nsynchrotrons and X-ray free electron lasers. Typically, the crystal is exposed to X-rays, which diffract and are\ncollected on a detector to create diffraction patterns. These patterns are processed by software designed to\nseek out weak signal on the images and create datasets from which the protein structure can be solved.\n The DIALS diffraction data processing package is a mature product produced in collaboration between\nLBNL and Diamond Light Source (UK) that has primarily been supported in the US by research funding. DIALS\nis used at a number of synchrotrons world-wide for regular processing of user datasets and has been used at X-\nray free electron lasers for fast processing of large datasets collected at hundreds to thousands of images per\nsecond. The program allows fast feedback of data quality when incorporated into automated processing that\nallows users to quickly make decisions about beamline operation and experimental direction. This has allowed\nresearchers to produce high-impact structures in general biological fields, including human diseases such as\nCOVID-19 and malaria, and energy research such as photosynthesis.\n This proposal would create a US R24 National Resource for the DIALS diffraction data processing\npackage. The Resource would move DIALS funding in the US from primarily R01 research funding to a\ncombination of separate research funding and operational funding from this proposal. The operational funding\nwould be to support codebase optimization, maintenance, and refactoring, a build-and-release schedule, and\nnew robust and adaptable user interfaces. Further, it would provide user outreach and training, both for general\nusers, and through on-site training for beamline scientists to help with software integration into existing pipelines.\n The end result will be a well-maintained and documented software package used at synchrotrons and\nXFELs for routine data analysis without user intervention, and robust support for difficult cases.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nIn the aged brain, reduced brain size and altered synaptic function are observed in conjunction with motor and\ncognitive decline. Despite the importance of identifying what underlies these changes with aging, the molecular\ndrivers of brain aging and synaptic decline are not well characterized. Recently a role for non-neuronal glial cells,\ni.e., astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, has been proposed in typical aging. Astrocytes are 15% of brain\ncells and provide metabolic support for neurons, perform neurotransmitter recycling, and directly modulate\nneuronal synapses in the developing and adult brain. Studies show mouse astrocytes undergo regionally-specific\nmolecular alterations with aging, with unique transcriptional alterations in astrocytes of the cortex, hippocampus,\nstriatum, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. In particular, astrocytes of the cerebellum show greater transcriptional\ndysregulation than those in cortex, including upregulation of immune system genes in the interferon pathway.\nPrior work identified loss of cerebellar neurons in aging, raising the question of whether regionally specialized\nchanges to cerebellar astrocytes that occur with aging contribute to this neuronal decline. To address this\nquestion RNA sequencing of astrocytes from mouse and human, adult and aged, cerebellum was performed,\nidentifying Stat1 as a candidate transcriptional regulator of the heightened interferon state of cerebellar\nastrocytes in the aged brain. Upregulation of Stat1 occurs concomitant with reduced numbers of excitatory\nsynapses in cerebellum, and mouse behavioral alterations that are linked to cerebellar function. In Aim 1\nexperiments are performed to ask if Stat1 is responsible for driving the aged astrocyte signature in the cerebellum\nby: decreasing expression of Stat1 in astrocytes in aged mice using viral delivery of the RNA degrading enzyme\nCasRx to ask if this is sufficient to revert cerebellar astrocyte aging signatures, and rescue synaptic and\nbehavioral deficits that are present; knocking-out Stat1 from adult astrocytes to ask if this is sufficient to prevent\nthe induction of aging-related alterations in cerebellar astrocytes; over-expressing Stat1 in cerebellar astrocytes\nin juvenile mice to ask if this is sufficient to drive aging-related transcriptional signatures and motor decline. In\nAim 2 experiments address the cues that drive upregulation of Stat1 and the genes it regulates in aged cerebellar\nastrocytes, focusing on signaling through the interferon receptor in astrocytes, and asking if the source of\ninterferon originates within the brain or in the periphery. These experiments will provide mechanistic insight into\nthe transcriptional regulation of aging-associated astrocyte states and reveal their contribution to synaptic and\nbehavioral decline in the aging brain.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nOur overarching goal is to determine whether a newly discovered form of macromolecular organization \u2013 protein\nphase-separation \u2013 contributes to the age dependency of human diseases. Recently, it has been appreciated\nthat many proteins related to age-dependent disease have the capacity to self-associate, condensing to form\nseparate \u2018phase-separated\u2019 compartments called biomolecular condensates. In vitro, some of these protein\ncondensates can mature over time into toxic aggregates. However, the generality of this property is unclear, as\nis the degree to which it may be altered for mutant proteins associated with different ages of disease onset and\nprogression. Our proposal leverages comprehensive libraries of human disease alleles along with biochemistry,\ncell biology, and physiological modeling to investigate and define the contribution of protein phase separation,\nand aggregation, to the age dependency of human disease processes. Many human diseases involve defects\nin protein folding that can be amplified with age-dependent declines in protein quality control. Moreover, many\ndisease alleles arise within intrinsically disordered regions of proteins, which often control phase separation\nbehaviors. Yet whether disease alleles commonly create imbalances in protein phase separation and\naggregation processes is unclear. Taking advantage of comprehensive libraries of mutant proteins associated\nwith diverse human diseases, we recently investigated the phase-separation processes of more than two\nhundred disease-associated proteins. These data revealed a strong enrichment for phase separation properties\namong proteins with later ages of disease onset. In targeted follow-up experiments we also validated that disease\nvariants in those proteins had strong effects on their phase separation and aggregation behaviors. To define the\nrelationships between protein phase separation and the age dependency of human disease we will conduct the\nfollowing experiments: 1. Define phase separation properties of proteins driving diverse human diseases; 2.\nCharacterize aggregation and prion-like \u2018seeding\u2019 associated with human disease alleles; 3. Identify protein-\nautonomous and age-related systemic drivers of altered phase separation in disease. We will also investigate\nwhether protein phase separation provides a mechanism to understand and potentially block the impact of\ndominant disease alleles in the context of aging. Together, our proposal will define biophysical and systemic\nfeatures driving phase separation and aggregation, a critical aspect of many age-related disease pathologies.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT ABSTRACT\nRead aligners first build an index from one or more reference genome(s) and subsequently use it to find and\nextend matched subsequences between sequence reads and the reference(s). The bottleneck of using these\nread aligners to index thousands of human reference genomes is the space and time needed for construct\nand store the index. Hence, in the case of the human genome, it is common to restrict interest to alignment of\nthe standard reference genome, i.e., GChr38. Yet, the absence of diversity in this single reference genome\ncan cause substandard results in downstream analysis, impacting the ability to identify and study genetic\nvariation.\n To address the shortcomings associated with using a single reference genome, the concept of a pange-\nnomics reference genome has been introduced and adopted. For example, Giraffe, VG, and Moni all aim\nto index a population of genomes in a manner that enables read alignment. Although, these pangenomics\naligners have been shown to improve on the accuracy over standard read aligners (e.g., BWA and Bowtie)\nthere exists several challenges that prevent these methods from being used in practice for downstream anal-\nysis, such as variant calling. The goal of this proposal is to develop algorithms to address these challenges\nand fully enable pangenomics alignment. In particular, we will create methods for selecting (from a large\npopulation) a subset genomes that will achieve the most accurate alignment results, develop a pangenomics\nscoring scheme that will enable the alignments from a pangenome to be attained, and disseminate our\nmethods in a user-friendly manner that enables automated updates.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Summary\nFalls and fall-related injuries are a growing public health concern, particularly in regions of the\nworld in which high proportions of the population are elderly. When older adults are affected with\nneurological conditions such as stroke, neuropathies, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis,\nAlzheimer's disease, the risk for falling increases substantially. Falls and the resulting fear of falls\ncan mark the beginning of a decline in function, participation in social activities, and\nindependence, thus negatively affecting the quality of life. One in three people over the age of 65\nyears who are living in the community experience at least one fall each year. About 10% of these\nfalls are associated with serious injuries such as traumatic brain injury and hip fractures. Injuries\nresulting from falls are the leading cause of hospitalization and financial hardships in older adults.\nLoss of balance is one of the common precipitants of falls. Interventions in the form of walking,\ncycling, structured exercises, and general medications are available, but do not significantly\nreduce the risk of falling.\nOlder adults often have alterations in the brain balance circuit that cause ineffective responses to\nprevent a fall when balance is challenged. In this proposal, we present early data from human\nstudies in which transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was guided by magnetic resonance\nimaging [MRI] and electroencephalography [EEG] to focus on the supplementary motor area in\nelderly subjects with balance disorders. These data show that the balance-circuit activation\npatterns in those elderly patients changed to patterns resembling young healthy subjects, and\nthat short-term balance was improved (long-term balance improvement was not evaluated). Our\naim in the proposed Phase I project is to conduct a more comprehensive clinical study of these\nguided TMS methods in the treatment of balance deficits in elderly patients with a history of falls.\nIf we are technically successful in this Phase I project, we intend to conduct Phase II definitive\nstudies that will validate the science to the satisfaction of the Food and Drug Administration. We\nwould then commercialize the technology by streamlining workflow and increasing patient access\nthrough the fusion of the MRI, EEG, and TMS functionalities into a single compact mobile device\n(aimed at treating balance deficits and other neurological disorders of the elderly). The new\nbalance-treatment device could be placed in geriatric or otolaryngology clinics, driven to patient's\nhomes, or rotated among nursing home facilities.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract \u2013 Medication non-adherence is a persistent public health problem that impacts many patient\npopulations and causes all stakeholders\u2014patients, families, pharmacies, pharmaceutical developers, doctors,\nand insurers\u2014to lose. It contributes to 45% of treatment failures, 700,000 annual hospitalizations, and one death\nevery 19 minutes, making it responsible for $100B in preventable medical costs per year. Medication non-\nadherence occurs across diverse care settings, including in increasingly utilized (Covid and post-Covid) home-\nbased acute care and post-acute care programs. For example, a study of 50 patients at a Hospital at-Home\nprogram found nine potential adverse drug events related to unintentional medication non-adherence. Similarly,\ntherapeutics have been kept off the market due to non-adherence during clinical trials, resulting in erroneous\nconclusions. Many device- and app-based technologies have repeatedly failed due to the high cost and high\nlevel of interaction required on the part of the patient or caregiver. To address the need for a cost-effective,\nusable/deployable/scalable, and highly versatile solution for real-time adherence detection at the point\nof care, Insightfil is developing a novel disease and medication-form agnostic technology platform using\nNear-Field-Communication (NFC) tags to measure medication adherence and reduce non-adherence in\nhome-based settings with minimal need for technological interaction. Low-cost, disposable NFC tags are\nattached to a variety of medication packages for automatic detection of the package opening, allowing the\nmoment of pill-taking to be captured via an accompanying smartphone application and entered into the patient\nrecord without the need to optically capture information. In addition, the app delivers real-time, personalized,\ncontext-sensitive notifications to encourage medication adherence to the patient\u2019s care plan. Our Phase I pilot\nstudy of an early prototype demonstrated that medication adherence improved from 64% to >95% with the use\nof Insightfil technology which was maintained over 18 months. In Phase II, Insightfil will collaborate with UMass\nChan Medical School\u2019s innovative Program in Digital Medicine to develop an NFC-enabled native app (Aim 1),\noptimize the app based on iterative user-testing (Aim 2), and rigorously demonstrate acceptability and fidelity\n(Aim 3) of the technology in home-based acute care, post-acute care, and outpatient settings The proposed aims\nwill advance Insightfil\u2019s technology toward commercialization and adoption by demonstrating its utility to increase\nadherence and improve patient outcomes across a variety of care settings and empirically and quantitatively\ndemonstrate the usability and accessibility of the platform. These key technical demonstrations will be leveraged\nto fund a type-2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial, evaluating the technologies\u2019 efficacy and\nimplementation within clinical workflow in preparation for commercial launch.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "STTR Project Summary/Abstract\nIt is estimated that every fourth to fifth death in the US is caused by a neurodegenerative disease\nsuch as Alzheimer\u2019s, AD related diseases, or Parkinson (CDC Wonder database, 2022;\nAlzheimer\u2019s Association, 2022). However, there are very few therapies or even molecular\ndiagnostic tools to detect these diseases, so the diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s and AD-related\nneurodegenerative diseases relies primarily on cognitive assessments which typically only occur\nwith onset of dementia. With no diagnostic test available for the early detection of\nneurodegeneration and no ability to differentiate between different neurodegenerative diseases\nearly on, it is unsurprising that over 43 % of primary care physicians report that they are\nuncomfortable diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer\u2019s (Alzheimer\u2019s\nAssociation, 2022). A diagnosis of \u2018Alzheimer\u2019s-type dementia\u2019 also often serves as a placeholder\nto describe a syndrome of memory loss that can result from various underlying disease causes,\nand which may require different therapies. Therefore, we propose to use Covalent Protein\nPainting (CPP), a novel platform technology that can detect, identify, and differentiate the\nmisfolded protein aggregates that characterize AD and related neurodegenerative diseases, to\ndevelop a blood-based diagnostic test for neurodegeneration. Over 80% of primary care\nphysicians say they would welcome such a test, in particular if such a test could detect AD and\nrelated diseases before patients are symptomatic or only show mild symptoms because it would\nhelp them devise a therapy plan with their patient and allow them to be proactive. Better and\nearlier diagnostics would also lead to better therapies, because one of the reasons so many\nclinical trials for neurodegenerative drugs have failed is that participants are usually treated too\nlate, when symptoms are already apparent. Our test would allow earlier enrollment of patients in\nclinical trials before too much damage has been done to the brain and would enable better\nstratification of patient cohorts, both of which would accelerate and increase success chances of\nclinical trials.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAlzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) rank prominently among age-associated\nneurodegenerative disorders, with Parkinson\u2019s disease trailing as the second most common. Contemporary\nstudies on AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) have unveiled cognitive decline indicators mirrored in\nnuances within gait and hand movements. These indications often emerge long before AD or MCI diagnoses\nare confirmed. Consistently, research has correlated slowed gait with cognitive deterioration, elevated brain\namyloid levels, and an augmented AD risk. However, the interplay between systems influencing both cognition\nand movement has largely been explored in separate studies. The depth of understanding around the cognitive\nefforts required for gait initiation or motor planning remains scant. Though dementia screening traditionally\nhinges on comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations and neuroimaging biomarker studies, gait and\nmovement assessment offers a more direct approach. Crucially, motor features remain unaffected by\nlanguage, educational background, or cognitive capabilities, positioning them as unbiased and consistent\nevaluative instruments. For example, the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) tests can be easily\nconducted at home and monitored, even using smartphone applications. In this project, we chart a course to\nharness cutting-edge AI and computer vision (CV) tools to aid in distinguishing diverse dementia and MCI\nsubtypes, such as AD-related MCI versus MCI with PD pathologies. Our approach integrates multi-modal brain\nimaging with gait and movement data from videos, aiming to extract nuanced markers for phenotyping\n(pre)clinical AD. These markers can then serve as precise digital trackers for both the progression and\ndistinction of age-related degenerative disorders. Ultimately, we aspire to enhance the understanding of the\nintricate links between gait, movement, and cognition in aging and AD/ADRD scenarios.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains a critical problem in patients infected with HIV, but it is also commonly\nseen in patients with diabetes, early Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Parkinson\u2019s disease, and many other conditions,\nand in its mildest form is also a feature of healthy aging. Over six million Americans are currently living with AD\nspectrum conditions (i.e., AD/MCI) and roughly half of patients infected with HIV are cognitively impaired, not to\nmention the vast numbers with other etiologies. Thus, there is a clear and immediate need to understand the\nneurophysiological basis of these impairments and, in the context of HIV, these needs are central to PAR-24-091,\nwhich calls for innovative approaches to identify how HIV specifically primes the system for cognitive decline.\nWhile the mechanisms that underlie cognitive impairment are poorly understood, many studies have probed the\nsystems-level brain circuits that appear to play a prominent role. These studies have been largely successful in\nidentifying the circuits, yet we still have a limited understanding of the physiology and dynamics within these\nnetworks, and the level of specificity to HIV related neuropathology versus cognitive impairment more generally.\nQuantifying the neural dynamics in affected circuits is critical, as different oscillatory responses (e.g., theta, alpha,\ngamma activity) have been found to code for distinct cognitive faculties, even when they occur in overlapping\nregions of the brain. Further, current approaches have generally not probed the dynamics, and have not had the\nsensitivity or specificity to reliability distinguish HIV-related pathology from similar conditions and/or healthy\naging. Thus, new tools and approaches are needed. Herein, we use an emerging dynamic functional mapping\nmethod based on next-generation magnetoencephalography (MEG) to quantify oscillatory responses serving\ncognitive task performance and spontaneous neural activity during rest in three demographically matched groups\n(i.e., cognitively impaired adults with HIV, patients on the AD spectrum, and cognitively normal healthy aging\nadults). Our novel dynamic mapping approach uses the latest in MEG instrumentation to provide spectrally\nresolved maps with excellent temporal and spatial precision, which we will integrate with high-resolution structural\nmaps of areal brain architecture based on multimodal parcellation, maps of amyloid PET deposition, and a battery\nof domain-specific cognitive assessments. Specifically, we will identify the oscillatory dynamics serving visual\nattention and visuo-spatial processing (Aim 1), as well as neural entrainment (Aim 2), and quantify spontaneous\ncortical activity at rest (Aim 3). Our overarching hypotheses are that these dynamic neurophysiological maps will\ndelineate unique pathological features underlying HIV-related cognitive decline relative to that observed in AD\nspectrum conditions and healthy aging and predict domain-specific cognitive dysfunction. Importantly, our team\nhas extensive experience working with these patient populations and developing circuit-level markers of brain\npathology using advanced multimodal neuroimaging.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Summary\nClinical diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy\n(MSA), two progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorders, can be quite challenging, especially at\nearly disease stages, due to the overlapping clinical symptoms among various parkinsonian disorders.\nBiomarkers such as neuroimaging measurements and \u03b1-syn seeding aggregation assays (Real-Time\nQuaking-Induced Conversion or RT-QuIC) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and some biopsy samples have\nshown promising results in improving PD and MSA diagnosis, but simpler, less expensive, accurate,\nand reliable biochemical markers, particularly those in easily accessible body fluids (e.g., blood), are\nstill urgently needed to aid in clinical assessments.\nGrowing evidence suggests that membrane-bound extracellular vesicles (EVs) play important roles in\ncell-to-cell communication and signaling and the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases, including\nPD and MSA. Additionally, EVs carrying unique disease-specific and functionally important cargo may\ncross the blood-brain barrier and be detected in vivo in blood, suggesting that blood-based but brain\ncell-derived EVs can be a valuable source of biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. We have\nrecently developed a new flow cytometry-based technology (Apogee) to analyze individual EVs carrying\nbrain cell-specific and/or disease-related protein markers in body fluids for improved biomarker\naccuracy and utility. These sensitive and rapid assays directly quantify intact, individual EVs, without\nextensive purification before quantifying disease markers, which potentially reduce inter-lab variability\nand increasing the clinical utility of EV-based biomarkers. Further, in recent pilot studies, we and others\nobserved that applying modified RT-QuIC assays to plasma EV samples could clearly distinguish\nbetween PD or MSA and healthy controls as well as between PD and MSA.\nIn this study, we propose to further fine tune and optimize our Apogee and RT-QuIC assays to analyze\nEVs carrying both brain cell-specific markers (e.g., L1CAM or NMDAR2A for neurons, CNPase for\noligodendrocytes, and GLAST for astrocytes) and disease-related markers (e.g., \u03b1-syn species,\namyloid \u03b2 and tau species). The optimized assays will then be validated for their performance in MSA\nand PD diagnosis and differential diagnosis in two independent plasma sample cohorts. These\nproposed experiments will likely establish two compensatory blood-based biomarker assays for MSA\nand PD \u2013 a rapid screening tool (Apogee) and a more accurate assay (RT-QuIC) to replace\ncorresponding CSF assays. Both assays can be used in future larger-scale MSA and PD biomarker\nstudies, which may establish the foundation leading to inexpensive and widely available blood tests to\naid in PD/MSA diagnosis and/or disease tracking.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Investigating the role of CSF flow in regulating CNS-adjacent bone marrow-derived myeloid cell egress after spinal cord injury",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nTraumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a sudden catastrophic neurologic event resulting in incomplete or\ncomplete loss of motor, sensory, and sympathetic function below the level of the injury. Consequently, due to\nthe significant physical, social, and vocational impact of this disease, it is not surprising that it results in a\nnotable decline in patient quality of life and increased socioeconomic burden. SCI results when a mechanical\nforce or forces are imparted on the spinal cord causing compression or transection of the cord. The delivery of\nthis mechanical force leads to the primary injury phase characterized by neuronal and glial necrosis, axonal\ndisruption, loss of myelin, disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier, hemorrhage, edema, and ischemia. These\npathologic processes then trigger a self-perpetuating secondary injury cascade, where among other features, a\nrobust inflammatory response including the release of cytokines and chemokines and infiltration by\ninflammatory cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils is a hallmark. Historically it was believed\nthat there was little interaction between the CNS and the peripheral immune system. However, with the\ndiscovery of the glymphatic system, meningeal lymphatic vessels, and that the CNS-adjacent bone marrow\nsupplies the CNS borders with a robust and diverse pool of myeloid cells, this concept of CNS immune\nprivilege has undergone significant revision. We now know that following SCI, the CSF is able to communicate\nwith the CNS-adjacent bone marrow compartment through osseous bone marrow-meninge connections in the\nskull and vertebrae. This signaling stimulates hematopoiesis and egress of myeloid cells from the bone marrow\nback to CNS borders including meninges and perivascular spaces, as well as to the parenchyma. Currently,\nthe exact mechanism of CSF signaling to the CNS-adjacent bone marrow remains unknown. It is possible that\nthis signaling is simply through cytokines and chemokines carried by the CSF. As there must be bidirectional\nmovement within the osseous marrow-meninge connections, with CSF moving in one direction and myeloid\ncells the other, an alternative explanation is that CSF can signal to the bone marrow through flow rate. In Aim\n1, we hypothesize that the rate of flow of CSF to the CNS-adjacent bone marrow is capable of regulating\nmyeloid egress to the CNS borders and parenchyma. Further, in many CNS diseases it has been\ndemonstrated that impaired glymphatic CSF flow, waste solute accumulation, and neuroinflammation are key\npathologic features that tend to feed forward on one another. Consequently, in Aim 2, we hypothesize that\nfollowing SCI there will not only be disrupted spinal glymphatic CSF flow, but also CSF flow to the CNS-\nadjacent bone marrow, and that this will promote increased myeloid cell migration into the CNS borders and\nparenchyma. It is likely this myeloid infiltration assists with the clearance of accumulated waste solute after\nSCI, ultimately promoting neurologic recovery. We propose that therapeutically manipulating CSF flow to the\nspinal cord and bone marrow to enhance myeloid egress will lead to improved recovery after SCI.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Mechanistic and Translational Investigations of HSPB8-associated dominant rimmed vacuolar myopathy",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Mechanistic and Translational Investigations of HSPB8-associated dominant rimmed vacuolar myopathy.\n Autosomal dominant mutations in the heat shock protein family B member 8 (HSPB8) have been\nassociated with (i) distal hereditary motor neuropathy; (ii) axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; and (iii) most\nrecently autosomal dominant rimmed vacuolar myopathy (RVM). Patients with HSPB8 RVM primarily develop a\ndistal myopathy in their 30s-40s, with proximal limb girdle weakness in their 40s-50s, and eventually become\nwheelchair-bound. Muscle biopsy shows fatty replacement, fibrosis, and rimmed vacuoles. HSPB8 is involved in\nchaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA), and in conjunction with BAG3, recognizes and promotes the\nautophagy-mediated removal of misfolded proteins. Our long-term goal is to develop a potent therapy to\nstop/reduce the progression of HSPB8-associated dominant-rimmed vacuolar myopathy. Major gaps: The\nmechanisms through which mutant HSPB8 results in aggregation, and the availability of treatments that preserve\nor restore proteostasis by enhancing autophagy for HSPB8-rimmed vacuolar myopathies. Preliminary results:\nTo investigate, in vitro and in vivo, the molecular mechanism of HSPB8-associated myopathy, and to assess the\npotential of new treatments, we generated: (i) patient myoblasts derived from induced pluripotent cell lines\n(iPSCs); and (ii) a clinically relevant C57BL/6NJ-Hspb8 knock-in mouse model with the c.515dupC variant using\nCRISPR/Cas9 technology which manifests myopathic weakness starting at 6 months. We demonstrated that the\nHSPB8 fs mutant is associated with: (A) increased TDP-43 and autophagy markers in the patient muscle,\nfibroblasts, and myoblasts. (B) The Hspb8 knock-in mouse muscle histology revealed central nuclei and muscle\ndegeneration with fibrous and adipose replacement; and immunohistochemical and biochemical studies\nrevealed aggregates, increased TDP-43, and autophagy pathology resembling human pathology. Our group\nperformed two high-throughput drug screenings and identified colchicine and trehalose to reduce the aggregates,\nadditionally, trehalose benefitted a mouse model of neurodegeneration. Hypothesis: Based on both in vitro and\nin vivo studies, our central hypothesis is that mutated HSPB8 exerts a toxic gain of function, and leads to HSPB8\nmutant aggregation. Our current results support the hypothesis that compounds that stimulate autophagy favor\nthe removal of protein aggregates related to HSPB8 fs mutations. Specific Aims: To test our hypothesis, we\npropose three specific aims: Aim 1: To investigate the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis of HSPB8-\nassociated myopathy in vitro patient iPSC-derived myoblasts and the Hspb8515dupC mouse model. Aim 2: To\nreverse the mutant HSPB8 pathology in vitro in patient myoblasts with an autophagy inducer trehalose. Aim 3:\nTo stop or reduce the HSPB8-associated myopathy by upregulating autophagy in the mutant mouse model.\nBased on our previous studies, we will use trehalose in vivo in the Hspb8515dupC mouse model. Successful\ncompletion of the present mechanistic and translational study will pave the way for the treatment of HSPB8-\nassociated dominant-rimmed vacuolar myopathy, and will also benefit other related disorders.",

ESCRT is a set of conserved and sequentially-acting protein\ncomplexes that play crucial roles in cellular processes such as endosomal traffic, cytokinesis, and membrane\nrepair. One important function of ESCRT in neurons is the formation of multivesicular endosomes, which are\ncritical for proteostasis, signaling, and the formation of extracellular vesicles that carry cargoes critical for\nsignaling and disease. Despite their central importance, the regulation of neuronal ESCRT complexes remains\npoorly understood for two main reasons: First, we lack the tools to visualize their activities in vivo at high\nresolution. Second, chronic disruption of ESCRT causes many pleiotropic and secondary phenotypes in\nmembrane traffic, making it difficult to decipher its mechanisms of action and to test the physiological importance\nof ESCRT-dependent events. As a result, it remains unclear how cellular processes like extracellular vesicle\ncargo traffic are spatially and temporally regulated within the polarized and complex morphology of neurons. Our\nresearch seeks to fill this gap by developing new visualization and manipulation tools specifically tailored for\nstudying ESCRT dynamics, using Drosophila neurons as a model. In Aim 1, we will investigate the dynamics of\nsynaptic ESCRT machinery at endosomes, and explore how neuronal activity influences ESCRT dynamics.\nUtilizing quantitative analyses of high-resolution microscopy, we aim to measure ESCRT recruitment to neuronal\nendosomes and examine its relation to endosomal and extracellular vesicle cargoes. Aim 2 focuses on devising\nnew tools for temporal and spatial control of ESCRT and testing the kinetics and spatial organization of\nmultivesicular endosome biogenesis and the resultant release of extracellular vesicles. These tools will enable\nus to engineer inducible systems for controlling ESCRT activities, investigate the temporal sequence of chronic\nESCRT phenotypes, and answer questions about the dynamics and regulation of extracellular vesicle release.\nOverall, our research aims to provide mechanistic insights into synapse-specific regulation of ESCRT machinery,\nshedding light on its role in synaptic function and disease. Furthermore, our tools will have broad applicability to\nthe field for studying ESCRT-related questions across different experimental systems, offering opportunities for\nmanipulating extracellular vesicle release and other ESCRT-dependent processes in diverse cell types or\norganisms.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nWith no effective treatments or cures, ageing-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) present a pressing\nthreat to our society. Converging evidence links NDs to defects in endolysosomal trafficking, a vital cellular\nprocess used by neurons to maintain their tidiness during normal aging. As one of the most extensively studied\nNDs, autosomal dominant Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in\nthe coding region of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene that leads to an abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in\nthe corresponding encoded HTT protein. This results in a dominant neurotoxicity and potential alterations of\nHTT\u2019s normal physiological functions that together lead to the selective loss of medium spiny and cortical\nprojection neurons in the brain. Interestingly, defective endolysosomal trafficking has been observed in HD, and\nHTT itself has been implicated in endosomal pathways from many in vitro studies. However, whether and how\nHTT functions in endolysosomal pathways in a physiologic condition remains unexplored. HTT forms a tight\ncomplex with its cognate binding partner HAP40, both of which are conserved in the model organism Drosophila.\nBy characterizing these two genes in Drosophila, I found in vivo evidence that HAP40 controls HTT in regulating\nthe functional convergence of endolysosomal recycling and degradation. Together with other evidence, they led\nto my central hypothesis that through HAP40, HTT regulates Rab4 and Rab4-mediated endolysosomal\ntrafficking, a cellular process potentially disrupted by polyQ expansion in HD. For the F99 dissertation stage, I\npropose to elucidate the molecular mechanism and functional consequence of this novel HTT/HAP40-mediated\nendosomal trafficking by harnessing the power of multiple complementary model systems, including genetics\nand genomics in fruit flies, live/super-resolution imaging in mammalian cells, and brain structure and function\nanalysis in mice (Aim1). Results from this study will define a novel and conserved role of HTT in endolysosomal\nprocesses, uncover its underlying mechanism, and its physiological importance. For the K00 post-doctoral stage,\nI plan to continue this direction of research but expand my training to new technologies such as human induced\npluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)/brain organoids that are more related to humans and with more direct translational\npotential, complemented with more systematic training in mouse ND models, to study endolysosomal pathways\nsuch as the Retromer complex that are implicated in more prevalent NDs including Parkinson\u2019s (PD) and\nAlzheimer\u2019s (AD) diseases. My goals are to understand how endolysosomal pathways contribute to different NDs\nand whether membrane trafficking pathways can be targeted as novel effective therapeutic avenue to treat NDs\n(Aim2). For both the F99 and K00 stages, I plan to devote extensive effort towards research training and\nprofessional development. Overall, the proposed study will elucidate the function, the mechanism, and the\ndisease relevance of HTT in endolysosomal trafficking, with potential to identify disease-modifying drugs for NDs,\nwhile providing me with the necessary professional training to become an independent investigator.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nNeurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, are fundamentally characterized\nby neuronal damage and cell death. Development of adult and pluripotent stem cells for cellular therapies or\ntherapeutic screening platforms may enable and accelerate novel treatment options for neuronal diseases.\nHowever, ensuring the precise differentiation of stem cells into functional neurons within 3D culture environments\npresents a significant challenge. To overcome this hurdle, this project aims to create novel bioprinting\nmethodologies for the production of human stem cell-based organoids by developing novel functionally-\noptimized bioinks and optimized hydrogel formulations for pharmacological screens. Aim 1 focuses on\ndeveloping a customized bioink, which includes water, biopolymers, ions, and cells, to optimize biochemical\nactivity and mechanobiological responses. This endeavor aims to create a brain-like matrix under 100 \u03bcL using\na multi-material approach involving proteins, polysaccharides, and functionalized nanoparticles. The goal is to\nreproducibly produce 3D constructs that reduce the variabilities introduced from under-defined commercial\nsources. For this research, the bioink formulation incorporates gelatin, collagen, crosslinking enzymes,\nphotoinitiators, silica nanoparticles, neuron-inducing chemicals, and human stem cells. This formulation aims to\nfoster the emergence of functional neurons 2-4 weeks after the 3D bioprinting process. Aim 2 focuses on the\nhigh-throughput (HT) assessment of neurotoxic chemicals' effects on the differentiation process of 3D hydrogel-\nencapsulated neural stem cells. Utilizing commercial hydrogels for initial tests, this research will explore chemical\ndifferentiation processes and evaluate the influence of neurotoxic chemicals on neuronal differentiation.\nCharacterization efforts will involve high-throughput imaging analysis methods plus flow cytometry that will allow\ndrawing correlations among bioink components and differentiation potentials. By comparing the outcomes with\nthose obtained using custom bioink formulations (from Aim 1) vs. commercial products such as Matrigel and\nGeltrex, this project aims to identify a new bioink formulation that has the potential to revolutionize how we\nconsider and conduct tissue engineering research, including high-throughput molecular screening work. This\nwould accelerate progress toward the development of screening platforms and new therapies for\nneurodegenerative disorders.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nUpper aerodigestive functions, including swallowing and airway clearance, are critical for airway protection.\nIn people with sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM), swallowing impairment, or dysphagia, is recognized\nas the primary contributor to early mortality, given its association with aspiration pneumonia. Further, upper\naerodigestive dysfunction is linked to reduced quality of life and substantial economic healthcare burden in\npeople with IBM. While these poor outcomes are well recognized in the literature, the project team has found\nthat the mechanism underlying these impairments is poorly understood in IBM and has yet to be well-defined\nusing well-tested measures. Preliminary data analyzed by the project team has begun to address this issue\nby applying the standardized and validated Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile (MBSImP)\napproach. Specifically, data of 13 patients with IBM revealed significantly worse and widespread dysfunction\nacross 11 physiologic swallow components, primarily within the pharyngeal domain, when compared to an\nage- and sex-matched healthy cohort. Such efforts need to be further applied to define IBM's gestalt and\nnuanced impact on swallowing physiology. Moreover, airway clearance ability has not been investigated\ndespite it being the first line defense mechanism to aspiration.\nThrough a cross-sectional design and by leveraging methods that are well-tested in diseases with similar\nclinical phenotypes to IBM, the research premise is to uncover IBM\u2019s impact on swallowing physiology\n(Aim 1) and airway clearance ability (Aim 2). For Aim 1, the following will be applied: 1) MBSImP for\ncomprehensive physiologic swallowing analysis across oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal domains; and 2)\nselected Analysis of Swallowing Physiology: Events, Kinematics & Timing Method for nuanced\nbiomechanical measures. Relationships between dysphagia severity and airway clearance ability in\nIBM will also be mapped (Aim 2) through links between global dysphagia severity (derived from swallow\nsafety and efficiency measures), voluntary and reflexive cough function, and respiratory muscle strength.\nThis project will yield the first and most comprehensive upper aerodigestive profile for IBM to date. By\nemploying well-tested methods, patient performance will be compared to published normative reference\nvalues to interpret IBM\u2019s impact on upper aerodigestive function. The proposed study will also provide new\ninsight into the interplay between respiratory-swallowing processes in IBM, which may lead to more timely\ndysphagia work-up, improve diagnostic accuracy, and promote the employment of targeted interventions.\nThis proposal integrates well-tested upper aerodigestive analysis methods, an interdisciplinary team, and a\nfocused research plan to accelerate the application\u2019s long-term goal: developing best practice clinical\nguidelines for managing upper aerodigestive dysfunction in IBM.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Summary\nLewy Body Dementias (LBDs) are a series of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by accumulation of\nmisfolded \u03b1\u2010synuclein (\u03b1S), including Dementia with Lewy Body (DLB), Parkinson\u2019s Disease with Dementia\n(PDD), and 1/3 of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD). DLB is the 2nd most common dementia after AD accounting for 30%\nof dementia cases; approximately 30% of AD cases suffer from \u03b1\u2010synucleinopathy resulting in a more rapid and\nsevere cognitive decline than AD alone. In brief, \u03b1S pathology is highly associated with AD and related dementias\n(ADRD). Braak et al. identified that \u03b1S pathology spreading as disease progresses from a substantial number of\npostmortem studies. Experimental studies have further demonstrated that misfolded \u03b1S seeds (i.e., brain\nextracts, recombinant \u03b1S preformed fibrils (PFF) are prion-like particles that can exponentially propagate\npathology cell-to-cell, tissue-to-tissue, inducing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, driving the disease\nprogression and causing dementia. These \u03b1S seeds can enter cells and induce endogenous \u03b1S monomer\nmisfolding and aggregation, assessed with the immunoreactivity of anti-\u03b1S phosphorylated serine 129 (pS129),\na widely used pathological marker. The induced intracellular seeds can be released to extracellular spaces, and\nthen the extracellular seeds start a new cycle of cell-to-cell transmission. Because intracellular and extracellular\nseeds can be easily interconverted, it brings the difficulty to cease cell-to-cell transmission of pathogenic \u03b1S. \u03b1S\npathology and propagation are observed mainly inside neurons, and \u03b1S is more abundant in neurons than in\nglial cells, indicating that the intraneuronal \u03b1S significantly drives the pathogenesis. There have been\ntremendous efforts on the development of antibodies against \u03b1S; however, due to the large size and structural\ncomplexity, antibodies have limited penetrability through the plasma membrane. \u03b1S antibodies do not enter cells\nand are inaccessible to intracellular \u03b1S seeds, but only to extracellular \u03b1S seeds. Furthermore, antibodies are\nusually not functional in the reducing environment of the cytosol due to the reduction of the disulfide bonds,\nwhich are critical for the correct folding of antibodies. In addition, antibody treatment could be costly and\ninconvenient in long-term disease progression. It is hypothesized that blockage of intracellular \u03b1S propagation\ncould be effective against cell-to-cell \u03b1S transmission, and all these gaps indicate an urgent need to generate a\nreagent targeting the intracellular pathogenic \u03b1S. In this application, we aim to develop novel nanobody-based\nagents that can targeting these pathogenic \u03b1S to block cell-to-cell transmission.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Falls are a major problem for people with Parkinson disease (PD). Falls and their sequelae are the leading cause of hospitalizations, precipitate institutionalization, and increase mortality in PD. No available therapy markedly mitigates fall risk and fall reduction is a major unmet therapeutic need in PD. A considerable body of clinical and preclinical research links fall risk, impaired cognition, particularly impaired attentional function, and brain cholinergic deficits in PD. Approximately two thirds of people with PD at a moderate stage have cortical cholinergic deficits detectable in vivo with [18F]FEOBV positron emission tomography (PET). In broad terms, cholinergic projection system impairments correlate with mild cognitive features in PD and gait impairments, but cholinergic therapeutic development has been hampered to date by the non-specific effects of currently available cholinesterase inhibitors and clinical trial designs that failed to target biologically and functionally relevant outcomes in participants at greatest risk. Preclinical research suggests that stimulation of \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic cholinergic receptors would enhance attention and diminish fall risk. We performed a successful target engagement study of the \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic agonist varenicline (VCN; Chantix) in PET confirmed hypo cholinergic PD participants. VCN treatment was well tolerated, had high \u03b14\u03b22 receptor occupancy, and produced relevant physiologic effects on gait and attention including reduced dual tasking cost during normal pace (npDTC) walking. We propose a single-site phase II trial in PD participants with Mild Cognitive Impairment (PD-MCI) to address a rigorous go/no-go rule determining if a multi-center large scale efficacy trial is justified. PD-MCI participants will be screened with [18F]FEOBV PET at the time of enrollment and only hypo cholinergic subjects will be randomized. In a double-masked, parallel-group trial of VCN vs placebo in PD-MCI participants, our primary endpoint will be the durability of VCN\u2019s effect on relevant gait-attentional dual tasking performance. An important secondary endpoint will be 1 year fall reduction in the range of the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID). We will explore the effect of the randomized varenicline intervention on a novel hierarchical composite endpoint of fall-related injuries, falls, and near-falls over 12 months as a future potential endpoint for fall intervention trials in PD. If our hypotheses are verified, we will have critical evidence to justify a multicenter phase III efficacy trial of VCN for fall risk mitigation in PD. Even with a negative outcome, we will introduce and test novel methods for future clinical trials aimed at fall risk mitigation in PD.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Theta burst subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation for cognitive and motor improvements in Parkinson's Disease",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In particular, Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) progression has been associated with LBD and cognitive decline in a number of cognitive domains including executive function, attention, processing speed, episodic memory, and visuospatial processing. The predominant clinical motor features of PD are bradykinesia, resting tremor, and muscular rigidity; however, the prevalence and severity of the nonmotor effects of PD have significant detrimental effects on quality of life. While conventional pharmacological and surgical treatments of PD are effective in improving motor symptoms of PD, they do not improve cognitive deficits and may even have long-term deleterious effects on verbal fluency and cognition. \nChronic high frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) is efficacious for improving motor symptoms of PD. Current stimulation parameters are optimized for motor benefit, with frequencies in the high gamma (100-180 Hz) range. Interestingly, increased low frequency oscillations (i.e. theta rhythms (4-8 Hz)) have been implicated in a range of cognitive functions, including spatial and episodic learning and memory. There is growing evidence that low (theta) frequency STN stimulation preferentially improves executive function compared to standard-of-care gamma DBS (cDBS). Indeed, we have generated data in PD patients with STN DBS that indicate \u201con\u201d theta stimulation improves hippocampal-based verbal fluency compared to \u201coff\u201d or \u201con\u201d gamma stimulation. Unfortunately, low frequency (theta or beta; 5-30 Hz) stimulation is not beneficial for motor symptoms. However, recent advances in stimulation programming allows for theta burst stimulation, which integrates high frequency (gamma 50-200 Hz; trains of 5-25) bursts of stimulation repeated at theta (5-10 Hz) frequency intervals. This theta burst stimulation increases theta oscillation activity. Moreover, there is evidence that STN theta burst stimulation is not only safe, but also has comparable motor outcomes compared to conventional gamma frequency STN DBS. \nOverall Goal: In light of our recent findings that theta stimulation improves cognitive function in PD patients with STN DBS, we hypothesize that chronic theta burst stimulation will confer a long-term cognitive benefit while concomitantly maintaining the motor benefits of gamma stimulation. The proposed randomized double-blind phase 2 clinical trial will focus on determining if 1) short-term and 2) chronic theta burst STN stimulation will improve both cognitive and motor measures; and 3) determining if theta-burst DBS and cDBS result in differing acute and chronic functional brain connectivity. The interpretation of data from this research will improve understanding of the acute and chronic effects of theta burst DBS on cognition and motor function. If successful, this study has the potential to develop a novel STN stimulation paradigm to treat both motor and cognitive PD symptoms as well as understand the effects of theta burst DBS compared to gamma DBS on fMRI functional connectivity measures. As this study is aimed at modulating cognitive networks, the ultimate goal is to develop novel stimulation parameters to treat chronic cognitive dysfunction in PD dementia and more broadly Lewy body dementia. Moreover, data collected, and collaborations developed will lay the foundation for a definitive Phase 3 clinical trial utilizing theta-burst stimulation for cognition and motor symptom improvement.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Over the last decade, significant progress has been made in wearable sensors that detect biomarkers in a\ncontinuous and non-invasive manner from biofluids such as sweat. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the\n second-most common neurodegenerative disorder in the United States, and early diagnosis and\nmanagement of the disease course of PD remains an urgent task. Among all biomarker types, the sweat\n metabolites, peptides, and anions can reflect both the phenotypic states of cells or organs and their\n dynamic responses to external stimuli, such as drug treatment. However, significant technical challenges\nexist in developing sweat metabolic biomarkers and wearable sweat sensors in PD monitoring: 1) lack of\n known biomarkers and accurate whole metabolomic and peptide profiles in PD patients' sweat; 2) the\n selected biomarkers need to be optimized for PD system and sensor technology; 3) current wearable\nsweat sensors fall short in sensitivity. This project aims to fill these gaps by proposing a novel framework\nfor predicting and optimizing the PD metabolic biomarkers using large-scale multi-omics data, to innovate\n non-invasive wearable sweat sensor with high sensitivity and specificity. Specifically, the biomarker\n panels and sweat sensor will be developed by bridging state-of-the-art AI and nanotechnologies to assist\nthe diagnosis and monitoring of PD, and will be validated clinically. The proposed research will provide an\n integrative infrastructure for developing novel PD biomarkers and non-invasive personal wearable\n devices. We will develop computational methods to solve a set of unaddressed questions in biomarker\n discovery, namely identification of PD-specific functional variations, prediction of metabolites and peptides\n in body fluids, and optimization of biomarker selection for personal wearable sensor (Aim 1). We will gain\n fundamental knowledge and technical capabilities in designing, processing, and optimizing of 2D\nmaterials-based wearable sensors for versatile applications. A physics-based, data-driven protocol will be\n developed to reveal the fundamental process-structure-property-performance relation for wearable\nsensors (Aim 2). We will develop new biomarker sets and wearable sweat sensors and test the\nperformance in assisting diagnosis and monitoring of PD, which could be extended to other\nbiological/disease systems (Aim 3). This proposed study will fill the gaps of disease-specific biomarker\n prediction and 2D material optimization in developing a clinically applicable non-invasive wearable device.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Lay Summary\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. Currently, about 6.5 million\nAmericans are living with AD. Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias are estimated to cost the US $321 billion per\nyear and this number is expected to 1 trillion by 2050, yet no small molecule therapeutic agent on the horizon\nthat clearly alters the disease progression and inevitable cognitive decline. The small molecule drugs and\nanti-bodies that have been developed based on the amyloid cascade hypothesis showed a limited (if any)\ndisease modifying benefit so far. Thus, it would be very important to validate novel drug targets and small\nmolecules that work through a novel mechanism of action for future AD therapy. Neuroinflammation is\nrecognized as a key phenotype in the AD brain that is associated with the development of dementia.\nProstaglandin-E2 receptor EP2, which acts downstream of complex signaling by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)\nappears as a key driver of neuroinflammation. Activation of this receptor further induces COX-2 creating a\nvicious reactive cycle in the brain. We have recently developed a suite of small-molecule antagonists for this\nreceptor and derived a proof-of-concept in 5xFAD mouse models demonstrating antagonism of EP2\nattenuates neuroinflammation and the amyloid load in the brain. Moreover, we have validated that EP2\nreceptor antagonism is associated with cognition sparing benefits in acute brain injury models of status\nepilepticus and a peripheral inflammatory sepsis model. We have identified several preclinical lead\ncandidates for development into a clinical lead and candidate drug to mitigate neuroinflammation and\ncognitive deficits in Alzheimer\u2019s patients. We now propose to define PK/PD relations of the lead EP2\nantagonists on Alzheimer\u2019s pathology markers in the brain and determine PK/PD relation on the AD relevant\nbiomarkers in the blood (plasma), CSF and the brain tissue in two different mouse (5xFAD and APPSAA)\nmodels that that display features of early-onset of AD (EOAD) and late-onset of AD (LOAD) in human.\nFurthermore, we proposed to conduct drug development studies to determine therapeutic index and NOAEL\nfor the lead EP2 antagonist and complete all other IND-enabling studies required by the FDA. Our overall\ngoal is to achieve a disease modifying efficacy by the EP2 drug that delays the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s\ndementia at least by 5 years. We envision that targeting EP2, a specific prostanoid receptor downstream of\nCOX-2, rather than a generic block of the entire COX-2 signaling is a superior therapeutic strategy for AD\nthat will bypass the adverse cardiovascular events found with chronic dosing of COX-2 drugs.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nProtein quality control is a fundamental system in the cell that is important for normal cellular\nfunctions and defense against potential pathogenic insults. Protein misfolding and aggregation\nare a central feature of many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD),\nfrontotemporal dementia (FTD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The complexity of\nneurodegeneration calls for large-scale unbiased screening studies. Over the past few years,\nwe have made breakthrough observations that have significant implications for the\nunderstanding of cellular defense systems against proteotoxicity. Using a unique blend of\nbiochemical, genetic, and cell biological approaches, we discovered a novel pathway to\nreprogram protein quality control, and with new genetic hits related to this pathway. Our work\nhas elucidated a previously unrecognized network in protein quality control. The studies on this\nnetwork could expand our understanding of proteotoxic-stress-responsive quality control\nsystems in the cell, beyond the well-established heat shock response or unfolded protein\nresponse. The findings will suggest new strategies for harnessing the cellular defense system\nto prevent and treat the relevant forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with\nproteotoxicity. Our project will be focused on investigating novel molecular targets that are\nidentified through unbiased screens and testing new small molecule compounds that have\nbeen designed to be specific inhibitors of this target. We predict that the advances gained\nthrough our research efforts will eventually lead to new therapeutic interventions to address the\nrelevant neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "The endolysosomal/Golgi system provides routes for degradation or recycling of plasma membrane (PM) proteins via endocytosis and degradation of cytosolic proteins/organelles via autophagy. Much evidence supports the idea that endolysosomal system dysfunction underlies a variety of neurodegenerative conditions, ranging from Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) to Parkinson\u2019s diseases. Among the proteins encoded by genetic drivers of AD/ADRD are core components of the endolysosomal system itself (e.g. BIN1, PSEN1/2, GRN, CHMP2B) and proteins whose endolysosomal trafficking is disrupted in the context of genetic disease (APP/Ab, SORL1, Tau aggregates). In addition, the expression of endolysosomal retrograde trafficking regulators such as the Retromer subunit VPS35 are reduced during aging, thereby promoting aberrant accumulation of toxic Ab species. Nevertheless, how individual risk alleles alter trafficking and degradation pathways within the network and whether diverse alleles converge on a common set of phenotypic outcomes remains unclear. This reflects, in part, the absence of a framework for understanding the key protein assemblies within the endolysosomal system that are subject to altered regulation in the context of risk alleles. Building on our previous work defining organelle quality control systems in iNeurons principally through autophagy, we now seek to re-imagine our understanding of the architecture of the endolysosomal system through the generation of \u201corganellar structural proteome landscapes\u201d within the system and through interrogation of how these networks are altered in the context of neurodegenerative disease risk alleles (including VPS35). Our approach merges organelle isolation with crosslink proteomics to identify interacting protein pairs and couples this with Alphafold Multimer to generate pairwise and higher order structural predictions across organellar proteomes. This approach, which overcomes several limitations of conventional methods for identifying protein interactions within the context of membrane-bound organelles, has already allowed us to generate structural predictions for hundreds of endosomal and Golgi protein complexes, including complexes that control chloride ion balance or lipid composition within endolysosomes \u2013 key drivers of organelle homeostasis. We propose to: 1) complete and disseminate an integrated structural proteome landscape resource (EndoLysMAPV1) in the HEK293 cell system (Aim 1), 2) generate the first of its kind EndoLysMAPV2 in iNeurons, which we have demonstrated express a dramatically different plasma membrane proteome including numerous dynamic synaptic proteins (Aim 2), and 3) create analogous maps in iNeurons harboring risk allele variants, including VPS35D620N and LRRK2G2019S, which dramatically alters the PM proteome based on our proteomics analysis (Aim 2). To demonstrate the value of our approach to reveal new biology, Aim 3 will mechanistically dissect new and validated transmembrane protein interactions with endolysosomal membrane embedded transporters that likely contribute directly to endolysosomal function and identity.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and over ten million\npeople worldwide are living with PD. To date, treatments are only symptomatic; they do not alter the inexorable\nprogression of the disease. The most common cause of familial and idiopathic PD are mutations in leucine-rich\nrepeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD demonstrate mitochondrial impairment, however\nour understanding of the molecular underpinnings of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD is limited. In our efforts to\nunderstand the underlying mechanisms driving mitochondrial dysfunction, we found that mitochondrial DNA\ndamage is a shared phenotype amongst both LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD. Unrepaired mitochondrial\nDNA damage can have major adverse cellular effects, impacting genetic and protein instability, compromising\nbioenergetic function, increasing reactive oxygen species, and triggering cell death. Recent preliminary studies\nby the Sanders lab has found that blocking kinase activity of ATM (a kinase that functions to sense, signal and\npromote repair of DNA damage) rescues PD-induced mitochondrial DNA damage. We further observed that\nATM is activated and initiates the DNA damage response pathway. Interestingly, mitochondrial DNA repair\ncapacity is impaired with a concomitant increase in specific mitochondrial oxidative DNA lesions. Our central\nhypothesis is that dysfunctional LRRK2 triggers the ATM-mediated DNA damage response pathway, which\nimpairs mitochondrial DNA repair capacity, leading to an increase in mitochondrial DNA damage, ultimately\npromoting downstream pathogenic PD cascades. We will test this hypothesis with three specific aims that\nintegrate molecular, biochemical and cellular techniques using established neuronal and murine PD models. Aim\n1 will determine the molecular nature of the mitochondrial DNA damage and the dependency on LRRK2 kinase\nactivity. Aim 2 will define the cellular mechanism(s) by which mitochondrial DNA damage accumulates in PD.\nAim 3 will determine the contribution of ATM to PD-associated phenotypes. This project will advance our\nunderstanding of LRRK2 function in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Further, preclinical testing may\nestablish ATM as a viable therapeutic target and lay the foundation for the development of neuroprotective PD\ntherapeutic strategies.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n The crowded conditions within cells present a complex physicochemical challenge for maintaining the\nsolubility and fluidity of thousands of distinct macromolecules. High macromolecular densities promote assembly\ninto a variety of distinct structures, which in turn can lead to the formation of insoluble solid aggregates. Though\nsolidified structures could indeed serve protective purposes or as quiescent storage sites, they are more\ngenerally considered to be toxic to the cell. The physical constraints and properties generated by crowded cellular\nenvironments, which contribute significantly to the functional behaviors of the resident molecules, are often\ndifficult to probe experimentally. In addition to membrane-bound compartments, which define the primary\nstructural organization of cells, numerous membraneless organelles (MLOs) populate the cytoplasm and the\nnucleoplasm providing additional complexity. These biomolecular condensates (BMCs) form via liquid-liquid\nphase separation (LLPS), a process that concentrates the resident macromolecules, but which in turn also can\npromote additional phase states, including solid aggregates. Multiple BMC-resident proteins that undergo LLPS\nin vitro are the dominant proteins in cytoplasmic inclusions found in patients with a range of devastating\nneurological disorders. In one such example, the fused in sarcoma (FUS) protein accumulates in MLOs termed\nstress granules (SGs), which form as a natural response to various cellular stress conditions. The high molecular\ndensity of FUS in SGs is potentially an essential early step toward the formation of FUS-containing solid\ninclusions linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Directly observing\nthe formation and growth of such inclusions within a cellular context is challenged by the lack of appropriate\ntools. While genetic approaches to attach fluorescent tags are commonly used to determine spatiotemporal\nbehaviors, their attachment can often perturb function, there are generally only a few reasonable attachment\npoints, and such probes have inferior photophysical properties. Recent improvements in genetic code expansion\nto incorporate non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) for in cellulo labeling promises to significantly extend the types\nof questions that may be addressed. This is particularly relevant for the application of multiple single molecule\nbiophysical strategies. The Specific Aim of the proposed work is to identify and characterize solid aggregates\nwithin live cells. To accomplish this, designer MLOs will be used to specifically modify FUS via ncAA-mediated\nfluorescent labeling in cells. Microsecond-scale single molecule rotational diffusion (\u00b5s-SiMRoD) microscopy will\nthen be used to probe for local environmental constraints such as increased viscosity or structural confinement.\nThe target application will be identifying and monitoring solidified FUS-containing aggregates.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary Abstract\n Children\u2019s reading and math skills are critical to their future educational outcomes, career readiness, and\noverall health and well-being (e.g., ACT, 2020; Cain & Oakhill, 2006; DeWalt et al., 2004; Geary, 2011;\nHeilmann, 2020; Krajewski & Schneider, 2009; Ritchie & Bates, 2013), yet many children struggle with math\nand learning to read (National Center for Education Statistics, 2020). Individuals who struggle with math or\nlearning to read often display weaknesses in executive function (EF) skills on behavioral measures (Peng &\nFuchs, 2014), which could underline one of the fundamental bases of their deficits in reading and math.\nConversely, individuals who struggle with reading or math may need to recruit additional EF skills to\ncompensate for their poor reading and math problem-solving to meet task demands (Martinez-Lincoln et al., in\nreview). By understanding the association between EF and domain-specific academic skills, we will have\ngreater insight into the development of reading and math, and how EF can hinder or facilitate academic\ngrowth. This proposal aims to examine the recruitment of domain-general vs. domain-specific EF (Aim 1) and\nthe connectivity for domain-specific and EF brain regions (Aim 2) in 7-8 yo children. After EF recruitment and\nconnectivity have been established, behavioral correlates that influence EF connectivity to domain-specific\nregions will be examined in a larger group of children, over-sampled for reading and math difficulty (Aim 3), to\nfacilitate a greater understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms of learning and how EF may vary by\nreading and math skill level.\n This proposal integrates behavioral and neuroimaging approaches, to fulfill the candidate\u2019s short-term\ngoals to distinguish the recruitment and connectivity of EF in reading and math for children and the behavioral\ncorrelates that influence EF brain activity and connectivity to understand development. These findings will\nsupport her long-term goals to use these complementary methodologies to develop effective interventions for\nstruggling learners and to identify how the recruitment of EF may differ across development. The proposed\ntraining plan will provide skills necessary to have a successful, independent research career in academia by\nenhancing the candidate\u2019s research program, while also expanding her research skills in four key areas: (1) a\ngreater understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms of reading and math, (2) advanced\ncomputational and statistical approaches to neuroimaging data, (3) scholarly productivity in educational\nneuroscience, and (4) professional development. The candidate\u2019s career and training plan will take place at\nVanderbilt\u2019s University (VU), a consistent recipient of funding from the National Institutes of Health. VU has a\ntop-ranking Special Education Program with one of the few educational neuroscience programs and has\nsubstantial resources to provide support to the candidate during the K99 phase of the award.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nThe pathogenesis of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and related synucleinopathies such as dementia with Lewy bodies are\ncharacterized by progressive deposition Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites composed primarily of phosphorylated alpha-\nsynuclein aggregates (\u03b1-syn), neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier compromise, and neurodegeneration. Currently, there\nare no clinically approved biomarker diagnostic tools or disease modifying treatments for PD. Clinical diagnosis is based\non a combination of motor and nonmotor symptoms, but the neurodegeneration process may precede the first appearance\nof these symptoms by decades. Empirical data suggests that levels of oligomeric \u03b1-syn in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of\nPD patients surpass those of normal individuals by several orders of magnitude. Oligomeric \u03b1-syn and reactive gliosis are\nstrongly implicated in the initiation and spread of the disease. Recent data from clinical trials with anti-amyloid-\u03b2 (anti-A\u03b2)\nmonoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), (despite lack of clarity in the full safety/efficacy profile),\nsuggest that anti-A\u03b2 mAbs statistically improved cognitive and biomarker outcomes, demonstrating that neurodegenerative\namyloidosis disorders can be slowed or halted. Over the past decade, we have demonstrated in several mouse models of\nneurodegeneration that following tail vein injection, liposomes bearing an imaging contrast payload cross the BBB into the\nCSF, primarily at the blood-CSF barrier at the at the choroid plexus and cerebrovascular leaks and bind to specific targets\nwithin the brain, enabling separation of disease mice from controls using noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nor computed tomography imaging. Our lead product is currently in clinical trials as the first MRI-based imaging agents for\nA\u03b2 plaques in AD. In a recent proposal funded by the NIA (R21 AG067131), we hypothesized that a variant of our agent\nlabeled with oligomeric \u03b1-syn ligands will act as a scavenger for the pathologic species resulting in the formation of cross-\nlinked agglomerates of the agent and pathologic species making them more suitable substrates for rapid phagocytosis (sizes\n> 0.5 microns) by activated glia. This in turn can lead to momentary accumulation of detectable levels of the agent in PD\npositive brains enabling noninvasive separation of test subjects from controls. Our preliminary data demonstrates successful\nin vitro formation of agglomerates upon exposure of the agent to \u03b1-syn fibrils and accelerated uptake of the ensuing\nagglomerates by microglia and neuroblastoma cell lines. In vivo administration by tail vein injection followed by MRI\nshowed statistically significant signal enhancement in the brains of transgenic mice versus controls. The in vivo data was\nverified by ex-vivo immunohistochemical analysis which showed a correlation between in vivo MRI signal, regional\ndistribution of the agent in brain tissue, Lewy pathology, and microglia activity. In this application, we seek to capitalize on\nthis data and our experience in the area to fully establish the preclinical potential of our nano scavenger concept both as\ndiagnostic and therapeutic strategies for PD. Specifically, we propose to test the efficacy of the agent to profile/halt disease\nprogression from the prodromal stage through early to late stages in the M83 \u03b1-syn transgenic mouse line. The in vivo data\nwill be validated with ex vivo histology analysis and behavioral studies. Furthermore, we propose to establish more insights\non the cellular mechanisms involved in uptake and degradation of the biomarker using both murine and human cell lines.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Abstract\n Cognitive impairment is a significant non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). At least 75% of\nPD patients surviving for more than 10 years will develop Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia (PDD) and the\nincidence rate of dementia in PD is 4-6 times of the general population. PDD and dementia with Lewy bodies\n(DLB), jointly known as Lewy body dementia (LBD), are both caused by abnormal deposits of proteins in the\nbrain called Lewy bodies, and account for 4-10% of all dementia patients. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is\nconsidered an important biomarker for neurodegeneration. There remains an urgent unmet need to establish\nreliable and practical neuroimaging biomarkers related to cognitive functions to describe both the spatial and\ntemporal progression of LBD. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a completely noninvasive method for measuring\nCBF and is ideal for frequent non-invasive longitudinal monitoring. ASL methods typically apply spatially\nselective inversion modules to supply arteries distant from imaging volumes, which is known to render\nunderestimation of CBF due to transit time delay, especially among elderly subjects. Velocity-selective\narterial spin labeling (VSASL) was proposed to remove the time-delay artifact. Our group has implemented the\nfirst velocity-selective inversion (VSI) based VSASL with 3D segmented GRASE acquisition and\ndemonstrated its higher sensitivity to perfusion signal over conventional ASL methods. Furthermore, our\npreliminary data showed that VSASL with 3D single-shot stack-of-spiral-based turbo FLASH acquisition\ndelivered better perfusion image quality with fewer artifacts than using segmented GRASE, and high temporal\nresolution potentially allowing adequate retrospective motion correction. The overarching goal is to test the\nhypothesis that the VSASL-based CBF pattern is a reliable biomarker for LBD that predicts long-term cognitive\nimpairment and dementia outcomes: Aim 1, we will conduct further technical developments for 3D VSASL with\naccelerated acquisitions and improved immunity to head motion; Aim 2, we will assess VSASL\u2019s between-\nsession reproducibility and its reliability to detect regional changes in CBF related to movement tasks and the\ndopaminergic medication; Aim 3, we will investigate VSASL\u2019s sensitivity to early cognitive impairment in patients\nleading to LBD through both cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons. These studies are to ensure the\noptimized VSASL MRI technique with high reproducibility, reliability, and sensitivity to detect early changes in\nbrain perfusion that are correlated with cognitive impairment and dementia in patients leading to LBD.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder for which disease-modifying therapies\ndo not currently exist and the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. PD is characterized by\nthe loss of dopaminergic and other neuronal cell types, and the formation of pathological Lewy body inclusions\ncontaining aggregated \u03b1-synuclein protein. Increasing evidence suggests that \u03b1-synuclein aggregation may\noriginate in neurons innervating the gastrointestinal tract, and spread to the central nervous system in a prion-\nlike manner. While rodent models have demonstrated that gut-to-brain spreading of \u03b1-synuclein can occur and\nresults in neurodegeneration and behavioral decline, major challenges associated with the low-throughput nature\nof these model systems have hindered progress in the field. To address these issues and significantly accelerate\nthe rate of discovery of novel disease mechanisms, we propose to generate new gut-to-brain \u03b1-synuclein\ntransmission models in C. elegans, a rapidly aging and highly genetically tractable model organism amenable to\nlarge-scale investigations. We will construct and integrate brain-wide maps of spreading \u03b1-synuclein pathology\nand neurodegeneration, revealing vulnerable and resilient neuronal cell types in the face of \u03b1-synuclein insult\nfrom the gut. To decipher cell type-specific mechanisms that underlie these differential susceptibilities, we will\nuse a combination of high-throughput screening and single cell RNA-sequencing. Known and predicted cell\nsurface proteins will be systematically tested for a potential role as novel \u03b1-synuclein receptors, facilitating the\ntoxic invasion of \u03b1-synuclein into neurons. Nervous system-wide, single cell transcriptional analyses will provide\npowerful insights into both protective and detrimental factors responsible for the fate of neurons in the path of\ngut-to-brain \u03b1-synuclein transmission. Collectively, this work will constitute the most comprehensive investigation\nto date of the mechanisms regulating \u03b1-synuclein neurotoxic propagation from the gut, linking cellular- and\nmolecular-level events at unprecedented resolution, with neuronal degeneration and whole-organism behavioral\ndysfunction. Given the accessibility of the human gut to pharmacological and dietary interventions, the results of\nthis study may inform early therapeutic strategies that hold great promise to halt or even prevent PD progression.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "The unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway plays an essential role in health and\ndiseases from cancer to neurodegeneration. Of the three UPR pathway branches, the\nIRE1-XBP1 pathway is the most highly conserved in comparison with the PERK and\nATF6 pathways. It has been shown that selective genetic activation of XBP1 in the IRE1\npathway is effective in multiple neurodegenerative disorders from Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n(AD) to Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Using an XBP1-driven luciferase reporter system, we\nscreened a library of newly designed macrocycles called rapafucins that are modeled after\nthe immunosuppressive and anticancer drug rapamycin and identified an activator of\nXBP1 named Rapireon. Further characterization of Rapireon revealed that it acts as a\nmolecule glue by recruiting FKBP12 to form a ternary complex with the cytosolic\ndomain of IRE1. Moreover, the FKBP12-Rapireon complex was found to selectively\nactivate the nuclease activity of IRE1 without affecting its kinase activity. In this\napplication, we propose to carry out in-depth characterization of the mode of action of\nRapireon using both biochemical and structural biology approaches. In preliminary\nstudies, we already obtained a low-resolution cryo-EM structural model of the FKBP12-\nRapireon-IRE1 ternary complex. We will continue to collect more data and refine the the\nstructure to better than 2.5 \u00c5 resolution. In parallel, we will build on our existing high-\nresolution (below 2 \u00c5) FKBP12-Rapireon binary complex x-ray crystal structure and\nattempt to obtain the crystal structure of the ternary complex. To improve the potency\nand specificity of the existing Rapireon lead, we will design and synthesize a DNA-\nencoded library (DEL) of Rapireon analogs and develop a solution-phase proximity\nligation/deep sequencing platform to identify new analogs of Rapireon from the DEL.\nOnce a potent lead compound is identified, we will attempt to improve the\npharmacokinetic property and bioavailability of Rapireon through structural optimization\nof Raprieon, giving rise to a Rapireon analog that can serve as a tool compound for\nexploring its potential in treating neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nClonal hematopoiesis (CH) has been linked to an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. However,\nits potential implications in various age-related conditions, particularly neurodegenerative diseases, remain\ninsufficiently explored. Recent research has highlighted the protective effect of clonal hematopoiesis of\nindeterminate potential (CHIP) against Alzheimer's disease (AD), emphasizing the need for further investigation\ninto CH's role across a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, the involvement of CH in other\nneurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal lobar degeneration (ALS/FTD), has not been comprehensively\ninvestigated. Additionally, the distinct implications of other types of CH, including autosomal mosaic\nchromosomal alteration (mCA) and loss of the Y chromosome (LOY), on these diseases have yet to be\nthoroughly examined. To fill this knowledge gap, this project will unravel the disentanglement of commonalities\nand disparities in associations between different CH types and neurodegenerative diseases by leverage a large\namount of high-throughput sequencing data of AD, PD, DLB, and ALT/FTD. Moreover, this project will gain\ninsight into the underlying mechanisms of its potential varying effects of CH across the diseases by utilizing\nextensive functional genomics data. To this end, this project has three specific aims. In aim 1, we will uncover\nthe associations of different CH types with neurodegenerative diseases by leveraging whole-genome sequencing\ndata from multiple cohorts. We will also perform Mendelian randomization to support causal associations\nbetween CH and neurodegenerative diseases. In aim 2, we will characterize inter-individual transcriptomic\nvariability in individuals with and without CH across central nervous system tissues and myeloid cells by\nleveraging previously published data, including bulk, sorted, and single-nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), as well as\nassay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), from disease cohorts. We will also\nperform cell type-specific transcriptome and chromatin accessibility characterization by detecting cells with\nautosomal mCA and LOY from snRNA-seq/ ATAC-seq. In aim 3, we will employ two innovative experimental\napproaches: (1) snRNA-seq paired with genotyping of transcriptome (GoT) and (2) iPSC-derived human\nmicroglia-like cells (iMGL) to delve into the cell type-specific functional impacts of CHIP. Aim 3 will significantly\ncomplement Aim2 since cell type-specific characterization of CHIP is challenging unlike autosomal mCA and\nLOY. Our preliminary results suggest varying effects of CHIP and LOY on the risk of different neurodegenerative\ndiseases and functional impact of LOY, especially highlighted in microglia. These findings validate and motivate\nour work plan, driving us to pursue further studies in this project. The comprehensive understanding of CH's role\nin neurodegenerative diseases achieved through this project will make significant contributions to the discovery\nof novel treatment options and the discovery of biomarkers for predicting the risk or progression of these diseases.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nThe world\u2019s population is aging, which brings about huge scientific challenges. Since the biological process of\naging is by far the greatest risk factor for most chronic diseases, understanding the molecular and cellular\nmechanisms by which aging leads to these conditions is of vital importance to increase the health span of older\nadults. Aging results in several structural and functional changes in the immune system and is clinically\nassociated with increases in the frequency and severity of infectious diseases and incidences of cancer,\nchronic in inflammatory disorders, and autoimmunity. This general dysregulation in immune system function is\nreferred to as immunesenescence. Immunosenescence is a multifactorial and dynamic complex phenomenon,\nwhich is shown as a lengthy adjusting and remodeled process existing in immune system during lifespan.\nHowever, the mechanisms under-lying age-associated dysregulated immunity are still incompletely\nunderstood. This proposal investigates a new perspective on immune cell markers and function with age\nacross NHP species with differing lifespans. In addition, we will examine the relationship between immune\naging and neurodegenerative biomarkers and cognition and compare these relationships across the NHP\nspecies. These studies will help determine the role the immune system plays in longevity, neurodegeneration\nand cognitive decline, which may allow researchers to develop and test immuno-restorative approaches with\nthe goal of improving longevity in humans.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and over ten million\npeople worldwide are living with PD. To date, treatments are only symptomatic; they do not alter the inexorable\nprogression of the disease. The most common cause of familial and idiopathic PD are mutations in leucine-rich\nrepeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD demonstrate mitochondrial impairment, however\nour understanding of the molecular underpinnings of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD is limited. In our efforts to\nunderstand the underlying mechanisms driving mitochondrial dysfunction, we found that mitochondrial DNA\ndamage is a shared phenotype amongst both LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD. Unrepaired mitochondrial\nDNA damage can have major adverse cellular effects, impacting genetic and protein instability, compromising\nbioenergetic function, increasing reactive oxygen species, and triggering cell death. Recent preliminary studies\nby the Sanders lab has found that blocking kinase activity of ATM (a kinase that functions to sense, signal and\npromote repair of DNA damage) rescues PD-induced mitochondrial DNA damage. We further observed that\nATM is activated and initiates the DNA damage response pathway. Interestingly, mitochondrial DNA repair\ncapacity is impaired with a concomitant increase in specific mitochondrial oxidative DNA lesions. Our central\nhypothesis is that dysfunctional LRRK2 triggers the ATM-mediated DNA damage response pathway, which\nimpairs mitochondrial DNA repair capacity, leading to an increase in mitochondrial DNA damage, ultimately\npromoting downstream pathogenic PD cascades. We will test this hypothesis with three specific aims that\nintegrate molecular, biochemical and cellular techniques using established neuronal and murine PD models. Aim\n1 will determine the molecular nature of the mitochondrial DNA damage and the dependency on LRRK2 kinase\nactivity. Aim 2 will define the cellular mechanism(s) by which mitochondrial DNA damage accumulates in PD.\nAim 3 will determine the contribution of ATM to PD-associated phenotypes.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nDental caries, the most common microbial disease, is caused by overgrowth of acidogenic and aciduric bacteria\nincluding Streptococcus mutans. Childhood caries incidence in the U.S. is high and there is a clear imperative to\nbetter understand caries pathogenesis. Cariogenic organisms thrive in biofilm environments. Amyloid was\nfirst identified in the context of pathology but does not always represent a protein mis-folding pathway.\nFunctional amyloid is also recognized. Amyloid aggregates are evolutionarily conserved cross \uf062-sheet\nquaternary structures with common biophysical properties enabling their detection and study. Multiple\nmicroorganisms are now known to produce functional amyloids within biofilm environments. Our group was\nthe first to discover Streptococcus mutans amyloids. We have now identified four amyloid-forming proteins in\nthis bacterium. Three of these, P1 (AgI/II), WapA, and Cnm are sortase-localized adhesins whose extracellular\ntruncation derivatives are amyloidogenic. The previously unknown fourth protein, Smu_63, serves as a\nnegative regulator of biofilm cell density and genetic competence. We have provided extensive tertiary and\nquaternary structural characterization of adhesin P1 and structural characterization of other proteins is in\nprogress. We have provided definitive X-ray fiber diffraction evidence of a classical stacked \uf062-sheet amyloid\nstructure for S. mutans amyloids. Furthermore, our work contributes to a new paradigm for multiple\nstreptococcal and staphylococcal amyloids. Naturally-occurring truncation products play two key roles within\nthese organisms' biofilm life cycles. First by promoting adherence to cognate ligands in their monomeric\nforms via quaternary interactions with the parent adhesins linked to the cell surface, and second by facilitating\ndetachment of biofilm cells and extracellular matrix components from aging biofilms in their amyloid form.\nThe left-handed Z-configuration of extracellular DNA within biofilms was recently associated with biofilm\nstability whereas right-handed B-DNA disrupted extant biofilms. The amyloid, but not monomeric form of\nneuropathologic A\uf062, drives conversion of Z-DNA to B-DNA. Cardiolipin-rich mitochondrial membranes\nmodulate amyloidogeneis of \uf061-synuclein and Htt involved in Parkinson's and Huntingtin Diseases. We have\nidentified cardiolipin as a prevalent lipid in S. mutans cytoplasmic membranes and extracellular membrane\nvesicles. In this renewal application we will explore relationships between S. mutans amyloid-forming\nproteins and B- and Z-forms of DNA in vitro and in vivo within adherent and detaching biofilms (Aim 1),\ndetermine the impact of membrane lipid composition on S. mutans amyloid formation within aging biofilms\nand assess interactions of amyloidogenic proteins with specific lipids of interest (Aim 2), and continue to use\nstate of the art methods including solution and solid-state NMR to identify and characterize structural\ntransitions reflective of monomer to amyloid conversion and determine if amyloid signatures for each protein\nare impacted by exposure to different DNA configurations, lipids, or other amyloidogenic proteins (Aim 3).",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Role of Rab27 Isoforms on Alpha-Synuclein Endocytosis and Clearance",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Synucleinopathies, including Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) and Lewy Body Dementias such as Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Parkinson\u2019s Disease Dementia (PDD), are a devastating group of neurodegenerative disorders that cause extensive social and economic burdens worldwide. The prevalence of these diseases is predicted to increase drastically, yet no therapies currently prevent neurodegeneration in PD, PDD, or DLB. Alpha-synuclein (asyn) is the key pathogenic protein that misfolds, aggregates, and induces pathology in PD, PDD, and DLB. Pathogenic asyn spreads from cell to cell throughout the brain, and misfolded asyn species are hypothesized to facilitate the spread of pathology by inducing the misfolding of nonpathogenic species. However, little is known about the exact processes that promote asyn propagation in PD, PDD, and DLB.\nThe goal of this project is to allow the PI (Kacie Scholz) to develop the necessary skills in neuroscience research to study key proteins involved in asyn pathology. The primary objective of this proposal is to investigate the roles of Rab27a and Rab27b on the endocytosis and autophagic-lysosomal degradation of asyn. Previous work from the lab of Dr. Talene Yacoubian, the PI\u2019s sponsor, has identified that Rab27b is upregulated in temporal cortical lysates from human PD and DLB subjects relative to age-matched controls, and that it acts as a mediator of asyn clearance and toxicity in asyn models. Further, our lab has identified Rab27a as a potential mediator of asyn uptake. Both endocytosis and autophagic-lysosomal clearance are critical components of the spread of asyn and asyn-related pathology. In Aim 1, the PI will examine the role of Rab27b in promoting the lysosomal clearance of asyn using in vitro and in vivo asyn models. In Aim 2, she will examine the impact of Rab27a in mediating asyn endocytosis in in vitro and in vivo asyn models. The long-term goals are to advance our understanding of asyn pathology and to identify new therapeutic targets for potential disease-modifying therapies for PD, PDD, and DLB.\nThe proposed training plan for Kacie is sponsored by her project sponsor, Dr. Talene Yacoubian. The overall goal is to provide her with a solid foundation for a successful career in academic science. The training plan includes experiences that will help Kacie develop skills in rigorous neuroscience research in synucleinopathies including training in the responsible conduct of research, critical research techniques, data analysis, and the available literature. It will also expose her to invaluable career and professional development opportunities in areas including scientific communication, translational research skills, and grant and manuscript writing. This proposal will drive the development of the skills needed to conduct rigorous scientific research in synuclein disorders and provide an invaluable foundation for the PI\u2019s future career as an academic scientist focused on neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD, PDD, and DLB.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project summary/Abstract\nNeuroinflammation plays a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive functions. Current methods\nto study neuroinflammation in animal models are extremely limited, primarily restricted to endpoint histological\nanalysis. Furthermore, a means to precisely control the neuroinflammatory response is lacking.\nThe goal of this proposal is to develop the first family of biosensors that can be used to report and dynamically\nregulate changes in inflammation within the brains of live animals. This is accomplished by a synthetic gene\ncircuit where a sensor of dynamic changes in inflammatory cytokines translates these changes into production\nof proteins capable of mitigating pathological inflammation. Building on our experience with bioluminescent\noptogenetics tools, we will develop a light emitting Bioluminescent Kinase Sensor (BlinKS) that activates a light\nsensing transcription factor driving cytokines to reduce inflammation. Our first aim is to develop and optimize\nsensors based on split luciferases that will produce light in the presence of a molecule produced in the\ninflammatory signaling cascade. Inflammation dependent light production is then leveraged to activate light\nsensitive optogenetic proteins to control cellular activity. Our second aim is to utilize these light emitting sensors\nof the inflammatory cascade in a genetic circuit to control the expression of an anti-inflammatory cytokine to\ncontrol inflammation as a self-regulating therapeutic in a transgenic mouse model of neuroinflammation. Our end\ngoal is to apply these inflammation modulators to various animal models where neuroinflammation is a key\npathologic hallmark such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Huntington\u2019s disease. We expect\nthese modulators to have high translational potential to combat neurodegeneration and other inflammatory\ndisorders.\nThis project is enabled by a multidisciplinary team of five labs with expertise in high throughput screening\nmethodologies for biosensor engineering, optogenetics, genetic circuits, high throughput single-cell sequencing\nand gene expression analysis, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and in vivo applications. We anticipate\nthat these new biosensors and modulators will be transformative tools for both neuroscience and immunology\nresearch and be a powerful therapeutic by enabling noninvasive imaging of inflammatory responses and\nselective, inflammation-dependent immunomodulation with cell type specificity that can be used in deep brain\nstructures, across large areas, in behaving animals.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n To move successfully, we must be able to sense our bodies and our environment. This is no more evident\nthan when participants attempt to strike a match to light a candle after their hand\u2019s somatosensation has been\nnumbed. Despite being able to see well, participants fumble with the match and clumsily attempt to accomplish\nthe task. Further, somatosensory-motor integration is notably impaired in many types of neurological movement\ndisorders including Parkinson\u2019s disease, stroke, essential tremor, and dystonia. Developing rehabilitation or\ntherapeutic strategies to improve somatosensory-motor integration faces a central challenge: while the\ntheoretical importance of somatosensory-motor integration (SMI) is clear, how the brain actually processes\nafferent signals to enable excellent movement control remains unclear.\n In this proposal, we seek to use a population neural dynamics framework to understand how the brain\nimplements SMI computations. Specifically, we will leverage a novel feedback-dependent dexterous\nmanipulation task, high-density multi-area recordings, and an innovative type of electrical stimulation that can\nbe used to modulate inter-area communication in the macaque monkey. These combined experiments and\nanalysis are designed to uncover how SMI computations, long known to be critical for movement control, are\nimplemented in population neural activity patterns in brain. Further, they will pave the way for developing\napproaches for restoring damaged SMI in the brain after brain injury or neurodegenerative disease.\n The main experimental approach of this proposal includes simultaneous high-density, high channel-count\n(Neuropixel) electrophysiological recordings from the primary motor cortex (M1), primary somatosensory cortex\n(S1), and cerebellar-receiving motor thalamus (mThal) in non-human primates that are learning and executing a\ndexterous manipulation task. The main analytical approach includes modeling the timeseries of motor cortical\npopulation activity as a combination of intrinsic motor cortical dynamics and inputs from S1 and mThal. The\nhypothesis of this proposal is that S1 and mThal exert different influences on M1 population dynamics throughout\nthe learning and execution process. Specifically, we hypothesize that S1 provides specific sensory updates that\ndrive M1 population activity, and mThal modulates the temporal dynamics of M1 population activity. We will\nfurther develop evidence for or against this hypothesis by leveraging a novel neuromodulation approach that can\nboost or interrupt communication between distant brain regions. Completion of this proposal will constitute an\nunderstanding of how SMI computations, that have long been thought to be essential for movement, are actually\nimplemented in the circuitry and population dynamics of the macaque sensorimotor system. This advance would\nimprove our understanding of how to target somatosensory nodes to improve control of movement following\nmotor impairment.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Mechanisms of mitochondrial genome integrity in familial and idiopathic Parkinson's disease",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and over ten million\npeople worldwide are living with PD. To date, treatments are only symptomatic; they do not alter the inexorable\nprogression of the disease. The most common cause of familial and idiopathic PD are mutations in leucine-rich\nrepeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD demonstrate mitochondrial impairment, however\nour understanding of the molecular underpinnings of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD is limited. In our efforts to\nunderstand the underlying mechanisms driving mitochondrial dysfunction, we found that mitochondrial DNA\ndamage is a shared phenotype amongst both LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD. Unrepaired mitochondrial\nDNA damage can have major adverse cellular effects, impacting genetic and protein instability, compromising\nbioenergetic function, increasing reactive oxygen species, and triggering cell death. Recent preliminary studies\nby the Sanders lab has found that blocking kinase activity of ATM (a kinase that functions to sense, signal and\npromote repair of DNA damage) rescues PD-induced mitochondrial DNA damage. We further observed that\nATM is activated and initiates the DNA damage response pathway. Interestingly, mitochondrial DNA repair\ncapacity is impaired with a concomitant increase in specific mitochondrial oxidative DNA lesions. Our central\nhypothesis is that dysfunctional LRRK2 triggers the ATM-mediated DNA damage response pathway, which\nimpairs mitochondrial DNA repair capacity, leading to an increase in mitochondrial DNA damage, ultimately\npromoting downstream pathogenic PD cascades. We will test this hypothesis with three specific aims that\nintegrate molecular, biochemical and cellular techniques using established neuronal and murine PD models. Aim\n1 will determine the molecular nature of the mitochondrial DNA damage and the dependency on LRRK2 kinase\nactivity. Aim 2 will define the cellular mechanism(s) by which mitochondrial DNA damage accumulates in PD.\nAim 3 will determine the contribution of ATM to PD-associated phenotypes. This project will advance our\nunderstanding of LRRK2 function in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Further, preclinical testing may\nestablish ATM as a viable therapeutic target and lay the foundation for the development of neuroprotective PD\ntherapeutic strategies.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nThe overall goal of our project is to validate a diagnostic tool for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and\nParkinson\u2019s disease dementia (PDD), two common neurodegenerative diseases affecting 1.4 million people in\nthe U.S. Currently, definitive diagnosis of DLB and PDD often requires the postmortem detection of disease-\nassociated alpha-synuclein (\u03b1SynD) aggregates in the brain. Clinically, DLB and PDD can be easily\nmisdiagnosed with other dementias and parkinsonisms such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and tauopathies. An\nunmet medical need is to identify biomarkers for early and differential diagnosis of DLB and PDD in more easily\naccessible tissues. We have taken advantage of the emerging technology known as the real-time quaking\ninduced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay to develop a robust platform for ultrasensitive detection of \u03b1SynD in\nperipheral tissues. In preliminary studies, we are able to detect prion-like seeding activity of \u03b1SynD in the skin of\nDLB and PD patients with 100% specificity and sensitivity. In addition, we were remarkably successful in\ndetecting \u03b1SynD seeding activity in multiple peripheral tissues including skin, sigmoid colon, and submandibular\nglands in autopsied specimens. We hypothesize that RT-QuIC of peripheral \u03b1SynD is a highly sensitive and\nrobust diagnostic biomarker for premortem diagnoses of DLB and PDD. To test this hypothesis, we propose\nto pursue the following four Aims: (1) Establish peripheral \u03b1SynD as a biomarker for postmortem diagnosis of\nDLB and PDD using RT-QuIC assay; (2) Assess skin \u03b1SynD as a biomarker for premortem diagnosis of DLB and\nPDD; (3) Determine peripheral \u03b1SynD and tau as a biomarker for differentiating DLB and PDD from other\ndementias and parkinsonisms such as AD and tauopathies; (4) Explore gut \u03b1SynD as a biomarker for premortem\ndiagnosis of DLB and PDD using colon biopsy. Successful implementation of this proposal will establish RT-\nQuIC assay utilization for early diagnosis of DLB and PDD using readily available peripheral specimens.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract:\nNeurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD)\nhave different underlying pathophysiological substrates. It follows, then, that these disorders may\naffect the visual system in different ways. Structural and functional changes in the visual system\nare critical to understanding and treating symptoms and impairments that impact quality of life.\nStructure, as revealed by imaging of the retina, an outgrowth of the brain that is amenable to\ndirect visualization, can provide potential biomarkers to aid in the monitoring of disease\nprogression. Advances in in vivo optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging over the past few\ndecades have shown that eyes of patients with AD and PD have generalized thinning of inner\nretinal layers associated with the ganglion cells, and microvascular changes. However, such\nchanges likely do not directly reflect the primary pathology across the spectrum of\nneurodegenerative diseases.\nDeciphering different manifestations of the ocular component to neurodegenerative disease\nrequires a clear step forward in the level of detail provided by approaches to image the retina. To\nachieve this, we propose to develop and optimize the next generation of visible light optical\ncoherence tomography (OCT), with 1 micrometer depth resolution, and associated machine\nlearning tools, for imaging and quantifying ocular neurodegeneration. Our visible light OCT\ninstrument achieves 3-5x better resolution than commercial near-infrared OCT systems. The\nimproved resolution provides a uniquely stratified view of cellular architecture in the inner nuclear\nlayer (INL) and of synapses in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), potentially providing in vivo insights\ninto circuit- or cell-specific retinal changes that have been reported in both AD and PD.\nPerforming OCT in the visible light range is also significant because macular pigments, which are\nassociated with cognition, are detectable and quantifiable through novel approaches. In addition,\nhyperspectral information in the visible light range purportedly detects protein deposits in the\nretina. In fact, our preliminary results suggest the ability to both localize hyper-reflective features\nin an amyloid AD mouse model and to decipher their hyperspectral signatures.\nGuided by basic studies in mice that verify the relationship of imaging features to disease\npathophysiology, we will investigate the potential for visible light OCT measures and markers to\ndistinguish eyes of persons with MCI (AD) and PD, both between disorders and with comparison\nto cognitively and neurologically normal controls of similar age. Based on the premise that\noculomics is enhanced by placing the eye in the context of the entire visual pathway, our research\nplan, supported by our team\u2019s expertise, will integrate advanced imaging with visual function\ntesting and quality of life measures.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nArtificial Axon Labs Inc. (AAL), an MIT spinout, is developing a transformative drug screening platform, Artificial\nAxons, to discover first-in-class remyelinating therapies for currently incurable myelin diseases, with the primary\nfocus on multiple sclerosis (MS). Current disease modifying therapies for MS prevent the formation of new\ninflammatory lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), but the majority of prior lesions fail to remyelinate and\nthere are no clinically available therapies to promote remyelination and prevent neurodegeneration. One of the\nmajor roadblocks in the discovery of remyelinating drugs is the lack of biomimetic drug screening tools that can\nquantify myelination in response to screened compounds, and do it in the conditions that mimic the environment\nof demyelinating MS lesions, which often contain factors that inhibit myelin repair. Assays based on tissues or\nco-cultures of neurons with oligodendrocytes are too complex for effective drug screening. Current screening\nmethods typically rely on 2-dimensional assays that can only evaluate compounds\u2019 potential to stimulate\ndifferentiation of oligodendrocytes (myelinating cells in the CNS), but not an actual process of myelin wrapping,\nwhich requires 3-dimensional axon-like structures. Existing in vitro 3D myelination assays such as glass cones\nor electrospun fibers are made of materials several orders of magnitude stiffer than the nervous tissue, and\ntherefore provide unphysiological environment to myelinating cells. As the result, remyelinating drug candidates\ndiscovered with these insufficient tools so far have limited success in the clinic.\n To address this urgent need, AAL is developing Artificial Axons, a novel biomimetic 3D-printed drug discovery\nplatform for remyelinating compounds. Unlike any other platform, our platform enables remyelinating drug\nscreening by direct visualization and quantification of myelin wrapping in response to compounds in the MS\nlesion-like environment. We create this environment by combining 3D-printed axon mimics, matching the\ngeometry and low mechanical stiffness of biological axons, with key pro-inflammatory soluble factors, which\ninhibit myelination in MS lesions (interferon gamma and myelin debris). These critical advantages over existing\nassays make our platform a superior tool for the discovery of remyelinating compounds. In this project we focus\non two milestones: 1) developing a myelination assay, which includes common inflammatory factors that inhibit\nmyelin repair in MS lesions (interferon gamma and myelin debris), and 2) validating the new assay by testing\nhow the efficacy of known pro-myelinating compounds changes in the hostile environment of MS lesions.\nAchieving these milestones will advance our technology on the path to commercialization and accelerate the\ndiscovery of remyelinating treatments for MS and other myelin diseases.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract\nNeurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s disease, constitute one of\nthe greatest challenges in modern therapeutic development due to an inadequate understanding of the\ninterplay of pro- and anti-apoptotic feedback mechanisms operative in the progression of these diseases. This\ninadequate understanding is in part due to a lack of practical (crosses blood-brain-barrier, well-studied\nmechanism of action) biochemical tools to modulate and effect related cellular processes, such as neurotrophic\nresponses (pro-survival, pro-growth, and pro-differentation responses), and metal ion homeostasis levels,\nwhich are both significantly perturbed in neurodegenerative contexts.\n The Williams lab and Epp lab propose to evaluate the mechanism and pathological impacts of a non-peptide\nsmall molecule, called trans-banglene (t-BG), which has demonstrated neurotrophic effects in cell culture,\nprimary neurons and mouse models of neurodegeneration, is orally bioavailable, and also has recently been\nshown by the Williams lab to alter iron-binding proteins in PC 12 cells. This combined impact on neurotrophic\nresponses and iron homeostasis makes t-BG well suited to provide insight into the interplay between these two\ncellular response mechanisms. However, a cellular target and mechanism of action is not yet known for t-BG.\n The following proposal outlines work to 1) identify the cell recognition/binding partner and localization upon\nbinding, 2) characterize t-BG treatment impacts on known neurotrophic signal transduction pathways, iron\nlocalization, and lipid oxidation profile in cells and tissues and 3) to evaluate impacts on neuronal morphology,\nplasticity and neurogenesis in AD mouse models. The interdisciplinary setting of the Williams lab enables both\nsynthetic access to derivatives of this molecular scaffold as well as cell response data from biochemical assays\nof their activity. The Epp lab will concurrently validate mechanistic impacts in hAPOE\uf0654 knock-in mouse tissues\nand measure changes in neurogenesis/neuron structure.\n Importantly, these mechanistic studies will improve understanding of the differential drivers of neurotrophic\neffects and iron homeostasis. Once mechanism of action is determined, and validated in mouse models, this\norally bioavailable molecular tool can be broadly employed in the biomedical community to study inhibition of\nneurodegenerative disease progression, helping to create the foundation for new medicinal strategies. Further,\nonce a cellular target is established, future work will use structural information regarding binding mode to inform\noptimization studies that increase potency and drug-like characteristics for t-BG, improving its utility and\nfacilitating drug development investigations.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nDecades of genetic and experimental evidence has placed \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S) as a central player in the\npathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD), Alzheimer\u2019s Disease\n(AD) and related dementias (ADRD). \u03b1S protein levels closely correlate with PD and ADRD risk, and reduction\nhas been shown to be protective in multiple disease models, making lowering \u03b1S levels a target for therapeutic\nintervention. Despite that, there is very poor understanding of how the abundance and turnover of endogenous\n\u03b1S protein is regulated. We recently found, using unbiased CRISPR screens in human cell lines and iPSC-\nderived neurons, that disruption of the NatB complex resulted in a stark reduction in endogenous protein levels\nand is well tolerated in human iPSC derived neurons. NatB installs N-terminal acetylation (AcN) of \u03b1S.\nWhile AcN is a prevalent post-translational modification, its functional consequences are not well understood.\nAcN has been implicated in several processes specific to \u03b1S, such as membrane binding, cell uptake, and\naggregation. Indeed, our own preliminary data support the importance of these effects and more. These results\nled us to hypothesize that lack of \u03b1S AcN compromises interactions that are fundamental to its molecular\nfunction and that pharmacological targeting of AcN represents a novel therapeutic strategy for \u03b1S\u2019s\ninvolvement in PD and ADRDs.\n We propose three aims that will rigorously investigate the implications of these findings on \u03b1S biology\nand therapeutics. In Aim 1, we will identify the molecular interactions that are lost when \u03b1S lacks AcN. We\nbelieve that this will provide critical insight into its biological function. We will also investigate the mechanisms\nresponsible for the rapid degradation of non-AcN \u03b1S compared to AcN \u03b1S. This may provide additional tools\nfor therapeutic reduction of pathological \u03b1S in disease and insight into \u03b1S turnover mechanisms. In Aim 2, we\nwill focus on understanding the outcome of NatB inhibition on the proteome and N-terminal acetylome of\nhuman cells and neurons using quantitative proteomics approaches. Such understanding will be essential for\nthe development of NatB as a therapeutic target. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will develop the first NatB\npharmacological inhibitors for evaluation in vitro, and in iPSC derived neurons. We use state-of-the-art\ncomputational approaches in combination with experimental high-throughput screening to identify molecules\nthat can inhibit NatB acetylation of \u03b1S with minimal effects on AcN of other proteins. These molecules will\nserve as essential research tools and as lead therapeutic candidates for PD and ADRDs.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\nThe greatest risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is aging, but the mechanisms that\nlink aging to ADRD disease processes are largely unknown. Of particular interest, recent single-cell transcriptomic\nstudies of aged hippocampal astrocytes, and multi-transcriptomic analysis of astrocytes from human AD samples\nand a mouse model of AD, show commonalities in the decline of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation\n(OXPHOS) and mitophagy related pathways. Although cognitive function can decline with age, many human and\nanimal model subjects retain function. Current behavioral/cognitive testing paradigms are inefficient at discerning\ncognitive trajectories in aging. We have developed a unique automated home-cage testing paradigm for spatial\nmemory that can reliably stratify cognitive performance in aged mice into cognitively \u2018intact\u2019 and \u2018impaired\u2019\nsubgroups. Molecular analyses show significant declines in OXPHOS genes, mitochondrial function and\nconcomitant increases in markers of astrogliosis specifically in \u2018impaired\u2019 mice. Whether impairments in astrocyte\nmitochondrial function are a driver of reactive astrogliosis associated with cognitive impairment in aging and AD\nis unresolved and is a critical question since it guides future therapeutic interventions. Our central hypothesize\nis that deficits in astrocyte mitochondrial function and mitochondrial proteostasis drive reactive\nastrogliosis that contribute to cognitive impairment in aging and AD, and that therapies that improve\nastrocyte mitochondrial function will delay cognitive decline. The following aims are proposed: Aim 1.\nIdentify astrocyte subtypes with dysfunctional mitochondria in hippocampus of cognitively impaired\naged mice. We will use high resolution respirometry to measure mitochondrial function in isolated hippocampal\nmitochondria from aged cognitively stratified mice. We will perform scRNAseq on hippocampal astrocytes to\nidentify subtypes that are specific to cognitive impairment and allow us to differentiate between healthy aging\nand cognitive impairment. Aim 2. Define the role of mitochondrial proteostasis in reactive astrogliosis of\naged mice. We will assess mitochondrial protein turnover rates as well as turnover of targeted mitochondrial\nproteins using D2O labeling of proteins in astrocytes from young, aged-intact and -impaired mice and determine\nthe contribution of mitophagy to astrocyte-mediated cognitive decline in aging. We expect these experiments will\nlink decreased mitochondrial protein turnover rate and mitophagy to the genesis of reactive astrogliosis and\ncognitive impairment. Aim 3. Determine whether interventions that improve astrocyte mitochondrial\nfunction alleviate cognitive impairment in aged and APP/PS1 mice. We will use AAV5-mediated\noverexpression of SOD2 specifically in astrocytes delivered via stereotactic injections into the hippocampus of\ncognitively stratified aged, and APP/PSI mice. We expect that the intervention will improve mitochondrial\nproteostasis, reduce reactive astrogliosis, and improve cognition. These experiments are the first to address the\nmolecular determinants of cognitive heterogeneity in aging.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "SUMMARY\n Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common contributing factor to degenerative diseases, including the\nneural and muscular systems; yet mechanistic studies in mammals are limited because adequate tools and\napproaches are lacking. Moreover, a greater understanding of the protein translocation mechanisms in model\norganisms such as S. cerevisiae and zebrafish is needed, because protein translocation is linked to\nmetabolism, signaling, and mitochondrial quality control and stress pathways such as mitophagy. Long-term,\nmodulating mitochondrial protein import pathways therefore is a potential target for treating diseases.\n The overall goals of this proposal are (1) to increase our mechanistic understanding of protein import\npathways into mitochondria in both yeast and mammalian cells and (2) to understand how defects in protein\ntranslocation contribute to disease. Attenuating protein translocation pathways can alter the location of\nmitochondrial proteins that are dual-localized (located to mitochondria and another compartment), change\nmitochondrial stress pathways, and induce selective turnover of mitochondria via mitophagy. However, there is\na critical gap in developing small molecule probes with specificity for modulating mitochondrial protein import\nspecifically in mammalian cells while minimizing off-target effects.\n Three specific study aims are proposed to accomplish these goals. In Aim 1, a new cell based screen in\nmammalian cells to identify modulators for all mitochondrial protein import pathways and specific cargo will be\nimplemented. In Aim 2, a series of experimental approaches will be used to characterize specificity of the\nprobes, to minimize off-target effects in mammalian cells and yeast, with the goal of developing specific\nprobes. In Aim 3, existing and new small molecules will be characterized in mechanistic studies, particularly\nfocusing on how defects in protein import alter mitochondrial stress pathways in mitophagy.\n In addition to increasing fundamental knowledge about the mechanisms of protein translocation in\nmitochondria, this application may have a broad impact on public health because our approach will provide\nnew tools that will provide a strategy for developing therapeutics for diseases that can be modified by\nattenuating protein translocation.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract\n Cells of the immune system, bacteria, and neurons are constantly interacting on every\nsurface of the human body. Recent studies show that bacteria have evolved mechanisms to\nengage with the nervous system, often using the phagocytes that regulate inflammation.\nNeuroinflammation, or inflammation in neurological tissue, is thought to contribute to common\nneurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, although\nthe basic mechanisms of neuroinflammation remain incompletely understood. The long-term\nobjective of this New Innovator Award proposal is to define the molecular mechanisms of\nneuroinflammation during infection. The innovation is our adaptation of the cutting-edge\nzebrafish molecular toolkit (optogenetics, biosensors, in vivo biotinylation) to host-pathogen\ninteractions. With this system, we can genetically modify host and pathogen, then observe\nbacteria invading the transparent zebrafish brain in real-time. As pathogens, we use\nmycobacterial species that activate neuroinflammation in humans (TB meningitis, leprosy) and\nin zebrafish. We have also developed new zebrafish brain infection models, using human\npathogens isolated from meningitis patients, in order to determine:\nProject 1: How do bacteria invade the brain from the blood?\n Approach: Define the endothelial mechanisms of brain invasion and vascular injury.\nProject 2: How do host versus pathogen factors drive catastrophic brain inflammation?\n Approach: Optogenetic (light-activated) control of phagocytes in vivo.\nProject 3: How do host versus pathogen factors injure neurons?\n Approach: Identifying infectious mechanisms of neuronal injury using biosensors.\n To answer these questions, this proposal combines immunobiology and neurobiology\ntools with brain infection models in zebrafish. Using live imaging of zebrafish brain infection,\nand genetic modification of fluorescent bacteria, neurons, and phagocytes, the earliest\ninflammatory and neurodegenerative events can be directly observed in unprecedented detail.\nCompletion of this work fulfills two goals. First, it will provide needed mechanistic information\non the host cells and molecules that mediate injury in understudied brain infections that\ndisproportionately affect people living in poverty. This will support the goal of developing new\ntherapies that limit brain inflammation. Beyond infection, the basic biological mechanisms of\nneuroinflammation, revealed by infection, will likely be relevant to the many non-infectious\nneurodegenerative conditions that are characterized by neuroinflammation.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAlthough amyloids are best understood for their roles in the etiology of numerous human diseases as\npathological protein deposits, amyloid and amyloid-like assemblies can serve critical functions1. To mediate\nthese functions, some cells have the ability to regulate assembly and clearance of these structures2,3. My\nresearch vision is to delineate the physiological pathways and mechanisms that healthy cells have evolved to\nregulate formation, function, and reversibility of amyloids. These studies are motivated by our discovery that in\norder to control translation during meiosis, budding yeast regulates assembly of the RNA-binding protein Rim4\ninto a translational repressor that has several biochemical properties of an amyloid (thus termed amyloid-like)2.\nKnowledge gained from these studies will lead to important advances in our understanding of the causes of\nneurodegenerative diseases and in time could lead to therapeutic opportunities.\n Based on our recent progress studying Rim4 clearance, we now appreciate that yeast cells use multi-\nsite phosphorylation to abruptly reverse amyloid-like Rim4 into oligomers and monomers at meiosis II onset4. A\nmajor goal of my research program over the next five years is to understand the molecular mechanisms\nunderlying this remarkable process. Additionally, we will decipher the signals and pathways that trigger the\nformation of Rim4 assemblies and we will elucidate how translation is regulated by these structures.\n Budding yeast is a powerful experimental system to study these processes. My lab can easily grow\npopulations of cells that rapidly and synchronously produce, and then clear, amyloid-like Rim4. We have\ndeveloped fluorescence-based reporters that allow us to quantify Rim4 assembly and function in single cells\nand selection-based reporters that enable robust genetic screens. We have used these tools, in combination\nwith biochemical approaches, to begin to illuminate the essential factors that govern how these extraordinary\nstructures are constructed by the cell and the molecular mechanisms underpinning their function.\n The MIRA award provided me with the support that I needed to launch and maintain my independent\nresearch program. While we made substantial progress towards our stated goals, this award also gave the\nresearchers in my lab the freedom to explore fruitful departures from our main focus. For example, we\ndiscovered that yeast cells utilize amyloid-like Rim4 to block the translation of retrotransposon mRNA to protect\nthe genomic integrity of developing gametes. By making these unexpected discoveries and by developing new\ntools, my lab has entered an exciting phase where we are rapidly gaining important insights into how cells\nregulate, utilize, and process amyloid-like assemblies.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Abstract\nParkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes are neurodegenerative diseases in which\nsymptoms include movement disorder, often autonomic dysfunction, and sometimes dementia. Due to high\nsymptom overlap, patients with these diseases often are misdiagnosed leading to high levels of anxiety and\ndepression, and to difficulty in developing therapeutic intervention. The parent grant examines candidate\nbiomarkers for these diseases in serum and CNS-originating extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from the\nserum. However, these candidates are based on current knowledge whereas other, perhaps superior\nbiomarkers may not yet have been discovered. Unbiased proteomics-based biomarker discovery is a\npromising approach but is practically challenging in CNS-originating EVs. Therefore, we will use EVs isolated\nfrom the culture media of iPSC-derived neurons from patients with the same parkinsonian diseases, and\nhealthy controls. These studies may lead to discovery of novel biomarkers that will further aid the diagnosis,\nmonitoring, prognosis, and treatment of parkinsonian diseases. The supplement will support a talented\ngraduate student co-mentored by the PI and a proteomics expert. The student already has generated\npreliminary data demonstrating that the experiments are feasible and promising. The co-mentoring, formal\nclasses, interaction with collaborators, and multiple professional-development opportunities will help preparing\nthe student for a successful and productive career as a scientific researcher.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract.\nThe human microbiome has a major role in the uptake and handling of nutrients, medications, and toxins; and is of great\nimmune system relevance. Evidence is mounting that it can affect aspects of neurologic function, brain activity, and\nbehavior via the \u2018gut-brain-axis\u2019. New propositions are that environmental exposures such as pesticides, metals, and\nair pollution influence the microbiome and the human immune system and that the microbiome plays a role in\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Here we propose the novel hypothesis that a) the microbiome is affected by chronic\nenvironmental exposures, specifically pesticides; and b) an altered gut microbiome composition or function contributes\nto the progression of neurodegeneration in PD. PD - a progressive neurodegenerative disease \u2013 has various non-motor\nsymptoms including gastro-intestinal (GI) features such as constipation and gastroparesis. Its pathologic hallmarks,\nnamely Lewy bodies and \u03b1-synuclein aggregates, have been found in the gut\u2019s enteric nervous system of PD patients\nalong with inflammation. The role of the gut microbiome in PD is underexplored and no study has addressed\nwhether toxins influence neurodegeneration via the microbiome. We previously developed a resource to investigate\nlong-term exposure to pesticides in humans, i.e. a geographic information system (GIS) model based on records from the\nCalifornia state pesticide use reporting (PUR) system. Capitalizing on our unique PUR exposure assessment tool and\nthe Parkinson's Disease Susceptibility Genes and Pesticides Study (PEG; R01 ES-010544) resources, we have joined forces\nwith Drs. Mayer and Jacob (UCLA Division of Digestive Diseases) - experts in brain-gut connection microbiome research -\nand propose to analyze the gut microbiome of 400 PD patients and 600 (200 age-matched household & 400 age-sex\nmatched community) controls using 16S ribosomal RNA to assess relative abundance of microbiota. Specifically, we will\nassess composition and function (using the predicted metagenome) in pesticide exposed vs. non-exposed controls and\nPD patients of different progression phenotypes. We will newly enroll 200 new-onset, of these 100 medication na\u00efve\n(MN) PD patients, to collect data on exposures, gut motility indicators, and fecal samples for metabolomics and culture\nbased experiments (before and after starting PD medications); assess differences in relative abundances of microbes\nover time using 16S ribosomal RNA and shotgun metagenomics and conduct metabolomics (blood or stool) analyses for\nnew onset PD patients (twice, longitudinally) and their household controls. We combine for this research our extensive\nexpertise in pesticide exposure assessment and studying PD progression in community-based patients, an exceptionally\nwell-characterized population living in a heavily pesticide exposed region, with the expertise of our UCLA GI team in\nbrain-gut axis research and the resources of the UCLA microbiome core. Our resources provide a strong and efficient\nplatform for addressing chronic environmental exposure to pesticides and their impacts on the gut microbiome and on\nneurodegeneration. This research will suggest novel pathways and prevention options for a growing elderly population\nwith chronic environmental exposures.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nA group of devastating diseases, collectively termed synucleinopathies, affect over 2 million people in the U.S.,\ncarry significant morbidity, high mortality and enormous associated health care costs. Synucleinopathies are\ncharacterized by the abnormal deposition of a misfolded protein, phosphorylated \u03b1\u2212synuclein (P-SYN), within\nthe central and peripheral nervous systems. Synucleinopathies include Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), dementia with\nLewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and pure autonomic failure (PAF) differ in clinical symptoms\nand disease progression rates. Currently, no disease modifying therapies exist for any of the synucleinopathies.\nDeposition of P-SYN within the cutaneous (skin) nerve fibers of synucleinopathy patients provides diagnostic\nclarity and increases with disease progression. Importantly, cutaneous deposition of P-SYN is also observed in\nthe majority of patients diagnosed with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), a prodro-\nmal synucleinopathy in which >90% of patients phenoconvert to clinically apparent synucleinopathy within 15\nyears of diagnosis. At present, methods for determining the disease trajectory of clinically apparent synucle-\ninopathy in patients with iRBD do not exist. Diagnostic tools able to evaluate and reliably predict the probability\nof phenoconversion at prodromal stages is an urgent and unmet need with clinical importance and public health\nimplications at a global scale. Cutaneous Neurodiagnostics (CND Life Sciences), a CLIA-certified laboratory,\nhas developed its core enabling technology of detecting P-SYN in small (3 mm) patients\u2019 punch skin biopsies\nand launched the first commercially available diagnostic test for synucleinopathy, the Syn-One Test\u2122. In this\nDirect to Phase II study, CND Life Sciences will advance the Syn-One Test\u2122 through detection of P-SYN\nin iRBD patients to predict phenoconversion risk and accelerate the commercial viability of testing\nthrough an innovative AI-powered augmented pathological interpretation of the results. To achieve this\nobjective, CND Life Sciences has conducted feasibility studies to demonstrate that cutaneous P-SYN deposition\ncan be reliably detected in 94-100% of synucleinopathy patients and in none of the disease control subjects,\nwhile preliminary pilot studies showed that P-SYN is observed in 64% of iRBD patients. In this proposal, CND\nLife Sciences will collaborate with the North American Prodromal Synucleinopathy (NAPS) consortium (an NIH-\nfunded project) to 1) define the metrics of P-SYN deposition and nerve fiber degeneration that predict pheno-\nconversion in iRBD patients (Aim 1) and 2) enhance pathological reading through digital quantitative analysis of\nthe Syn-One Test\u2122 using an AI-augmented detection system (Aim 2). Successful completion of this study will\nadvance the clinical utility of the Syn-One Test\u2122, improving patient care, increasing the commercial potential of\nthe product, and ultimately accelerating the development of disease-modifying therapies.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Summary\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and dementia present enormous social and economic burdens to the United States.\nIn 2019, AD was recognized as the sixth leading cause of death (121,499 cases) in the nation. The number of\nAD cases within the country is predicted to rise to 13.8 million by the year 2060. Most cases are sporadic in\nnature and their molecular causes remain unknown. A clinical report from last year suggests that the Complex I\ndeficiency may cause early onset AD in humans. This report linked a pathogenic mutation in the NDUFA1 gene,\nwhich encodes an essential subunit of Complex I. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that Complex I\ndeficiency predisposes to AD and dementia by elevating neuroinflammation and proteinopathy. It may\nalso confer sex disparity in the disease susceptibility. To test this hypothesis, we propose studies with two\nspecific aims. Aim 1) will determine the effects of Complex I deficiency on humanized A\u03b2 proteinopathy. Aim 2)\nwill determine the susceptibility of Complex I-deficient mice to AD and dementia. We will cross the Complex I-\ndeficient Ndufa1S55A mice with ApphA\u03b2 mice that express humanized amyloid beta (hA\u03b2) to generate double\nknock-in mice (Ndufa1S55A-ApphA\u03b2). These mice Ndufa1S55A-ApphA\u03b2 will be used to determine predisposition to\nAD and dementia in the presence and absence of humanized A\u03b2. Proteinopathy due to A\u03b2 aggregation is one\nof the hallmarks of AD. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will develop a real-time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC)\nassay to quantify A\u03b2 proteinopathic seeds present in brain and blood. In Aim 2, we will perform biochemical and\nhistopathological evaluation to assess the levels of A\u03b2 plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation,\nneuronal loss, and synaptic degeneration in mice brains. We will also assess cognitive decline by behavioral\nassays for spatial learning and memory. We expect to demonstrate that Complex deficiency increases\nsusceptibility to AD and dementia in the presence of humanized A\u03b2. The outcome of this project will have a\nsignificant impact on our understanding of the risks of AD and dementia, which can help in early diagnosis and\nprevention.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nMotor cortex historically has been viewed as a relatively stable region of the brain, with static cortical dynamics mapping to\nparticular movements. Recent work has questioned these assumptions, asserting that the brain\u2019s internal map of the external\nworld drifts over time. This phenomena, known as representational drift, may provide insight into how the brain adapts to\nlearn new behavior. Modeling representational drift and establishing its connection to motor learning are the primary aims\nof this proposal.\nCurrently, there is no standardized metric to track representational drift over time. Leveraging our repository of motor and\npremotor neuronal recordings, we look to establish a common framework for calculating the rate at which this drift occurs.\nTo do this, we will apply unbiased, probabilistic methods (e.g., continuous-time hidden Markov models, switching linear\ndynamical systems) that extract discrete latent states to the neural data. Models will be evaluated based on of\ufb02ine decoding\nperformance, and drift will be calculated by the transition rate across latent states.\nAfter establishing a common modeling framework, we will analyze how drift rates change across various motor tasks and\nlevels of exertion. To accomplish this, we will employ our novel, unconstrained recording platform, which allows for the\nsimultaneous capture of markerless kinematics and wirelessly transmitted neural data. By analyzing the neural data collected\nduring diverse movements, we can assess how both overall levels activity and different types of behavior impact rates of\nrepresentational drift.\nBy determining how physical activity impacts representational drift, we can better understand the relationship between drift\nand rates of motor learning. To do this we will study to cohorts recovering from motor de\ufb01cit. One cohort will integrate drift-\nenhancing activities during recovery and another will not. By monitoring rates of representational drift and motor recovery,\nwe can evaluate the effect that drift has on motor learning. This knowledge can then be leveraged to improve treatments for\nthose recovering from brain-related movement disorders, like stroke and Parkinson\u2019s.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nNeuronal tissue is the most energy consumptive tissue type of the entire body, and as such, depends heavily on\nthe health and proper regulation of its mitochondria, its main source of energy. Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction\nis linked to a number of neuropsychiatric diseases, including the neurodevelopmental disorder Fragile X\nSyndrome (FXS). FXS is characterized by loss of the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), an RNA-\nbinding protein that has been shown to interact with microRNAs (miRNAs) and components of the RNA-induced\nsilencing complex (RISC). Interestingly, using an optimized Ago-CLIP method that unambiguously identifies\nmiRNA:target RNA interactions within the RISC, our lab has identified prevalent binding of miRNAs to\nmitochondrial transcripts (mt-RNA) in the mammalian forebrain. Though mitochondrial dysfunction in FXS has\nbeen identified, a connection with RISC and targeting of mt-RNA has not yet been explored. This proposal seeks\nto further characterize the molecular underpinnings of these observed miRNA:mt-RNA interactions, as well as\ntheir impact in both health and disease (FXS). Specific Aim 1 proposes to use the same optimized Ago-CLIP\nmethod, termed CIMERAseq, to determine the subcellular compartment in which the miRNA:mt-RNA\ninteractions are occurring, as well as use a targeted approach to identify cell-type specificity of the transcript\ninteractions. Specific Aim 2 explores the possible functional effect of the observed binding by altering levels of\nselect miRNAs identified in our data and recording the effect in three ways: i) transcript abundance (via\nsequencing and qPCR) ii) protein abundance (via Western blot and BN-PAGE), and iii) mitochondrial function\n(via assessment of respiratory function, ATP synthesis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production). Aim 2\nalso uses the same effect readouts to investigate mitochondrial perturbations in a mouse model of FXS (Fmr1\nKO). If successful, the proposed specific aims will aid in understanding the role of miRNAs as mitochondrial gene\nregulators in the mammalian forebrain, both in health and disease. In addition to completion of the proposed\naims, this proposal outlines a training plan formulated specifically for my long-term goal of becoming a well-\nrounded independent scientist. Training received through the course of this fellowship will focus on enhancing\nmy skills in molecular biology methods, bioinformatic methods, and scientific communication and writing. My\nsponsor and university, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, are outstandingly equipped to not only\nallow for completion of the proposed experiments but also to provide the resources needed to receive exceptional\ntraining in the areas described. The Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology (BCMB) program in which I\nam enrolled is dedicated to providing an exceptional training environment and will support completion of the\nresearch plan as well as career training opportunities. This fellowship will support not only impactful research\ntoward understanding miRNA and mitochondria in FXS pathology, but also my development into a capable and\nindependent neuroscientist.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nAging related disorders, such as Parkinson's Disease with dementia (PDD), Lewy Body with Dementia, and other\nAlzheimer Disease and related dementias (ADRDs), are debilitating neurological disorders that affect more than\n8 million people in the US alone. Amyloid deposits, characterized by their insolubility and disruptive protein\nclumps, pose a distinct challenge in structural biology and medicine due to their atypical structure compared to\nsoluble proteins. In PDD, the protein alpha-synuclein (\u03b1S) misfolds and aggregates into self-templating fibrils.\nThese fibrils consist of repeating beta-sheet units, capable of adopting various shapes and surface structures,\nknown as fibril morphologies (FMs). Ensuring consistent FM for in vitro assays remains a formidable challenge\nacross literature given the variability introduced by factors such as salt concentration, buffer selection, and\nadditive choices to name a few. These assays are vital for the assessment of compound binding and cellular\ntoxicity, yet no expedient assay has been created to rigorously determine FM. The University of Pennsylvania\n(UPenn), sponsor, and principal investigator of this research proposal are uniquely positioned to accomplish the\ngoals outlined below. UPenn provides a robust infrastructure and extensive resources for groundbreaking\nresearch, the sponsor contributes deep expertise in chemistry and biophysics, vital for the project's scientific\nrigor, and the principal investigator, with extensive experience in the relevant areas of this research, is well-\nequipped to lead and ensure the successful execution of the project.\nThe project proposed relies on the hypothesis that proteolytic cleavage rates of a fibril are determined by stability\nof the fibril fold and enzyme steric clashes resulting in a specific kinetic proteolytic profile (KPP) which can\ndistinguish FMs. Current methods require laborious assays to pinpoint FM, and with FM often varying\nunpredictably under identical preparations, the need is clear: a streamlined and efficient assay to guarantee\nuniformity across samples and literature. Therefore, in Aim 1 introduces an assay that is designed to determine\nFM by KPP. Pinpointing the FM is foundational to reproducibility and enables Aim 2: a statistically rigorous high-\nthroughput screen (HTS) for exploration into the diversity of possible FMs. The envisioned HTS utilizes site\nselective chemistry via a cysteine to introduce mutations to the monomer structure of \u03b1S which is envisioned to\ninduce conformational change when fibrils are formed.\nIt is anticipated that a large FM library will be generated within the first few iterations which will not only expand\nthe collective knowledge of the FM manifold, or coverage of all possible FMs, but also enable the creation of\nconsistent preparations with specific features. Due to the number of potential combinations, Machine learning\n(ML) will be employed to guide future iterations of this HTS. By addressing these challenges, the proposed\ncomprehensive MORFS assay, HTS, and ML will revolutionize the analysis of amyloids, paving the way for\nreproducible in vitro assays for advancements in our collective understanding ADRDs.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Summary\nWhen searching their environment for food, animals often switch from making random changes in direction to\nreflexively orient upstream when they smell an attractive odor, followed by rhythmic turns when they lose the\nplume. Random changes in direction are traditionally interpreted as manifestation of a stochastic search process.\nIn this proposal, we test new hypothesis for the role of these random turns: animals turn deliberately to gather\ninformation before and after they change direction\u2014allowing them to compute important internal and external\nstate parameters such as wind direction, wind speed, ground speed, and altitude that they cannot directly\nmeasure. This idea is theoretically feasible based on the principle of observability, a powerful concept we borrow\nfrom control theory and informatics that is critical in the design of autonomous vehicles; here, we apply it to\naddress fundamental questions in neuroscience. To do so, we exploit the natural behavior of flies, which execute\nrapid turns (called body saccades) as they search during flight. Our research program exploits state-of-the-art\nexperimental techniques pioneered in the labs of team members, which we will leverage with genetic techniques\nand the rapidly emerging connectome databases available to the fly community\u2014an integrated approach that\nhas already provided our team with a solid foundation for our proposed effort. From wind tunnel experiments we\nhave discovered that hungry flies execute a brief, stereotyped turn when they first experience an odor stimulus,\nwhich we postulate they use to estimate ambient wind direction and speed before either executing an upwind\nsurge, or initiating a circling behavior in still air. From physiology experiments, we discovered a small network of\nidentified cells that serve as command neurons for generating spontaneous saccades (DNa0X and DNb01) and\nanother, specialized neuron that regulates their execution during flight (VS041). These preliminary results\nprovide a strategic entry point for our proposed work, which is separated into four Specific Aims:\n(1) Test whether DNa0X and DNb01 are responsible for saccades that mediate olfactory search.\n(2) Identify upstream regulators of the saccade generating circuits responsible for the olfactory search behavior.\n(3) Determine the role of spontaneous saccades in gathering information.\n(4) Develop circuit-inspired, agent-based predictive models of olfactory search\nThis effort to elucidate the circuitry that controls both stimulus-evoked and spontaneous turns during olfactory\nsearch and test their potential role in information-gathering links the ethologically important behavior of olfactory\nsearch across spatial and temporal scales\u2014from the transient responses of individual neurons to the long flight\ntrajectories of whole animals as they search for food. While not widely used in systems neuroscience, we believe\nthat the concept of observability will provide a major conceptual advance in understanding how brains function;\nspecifically, how the nervous system can collect information at different points in time and space and use it to\ncompute parameters that are for critical subsequent behavioral actions.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Folding and Chaperone Interactions of Multi-domain Proteins",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nCombining several functional units, termed domains, into a single polypeptide chain is a common\nevolutionary strategy for creating biological complexity. The resulting multi-domain proteins are\nprevalent in all proteomes and carry out essential cellular functions. However, the increased functional\ncomplexity of these large proteins complicates their folding into native functional structures. In contrast\nto many smaller proteins or individual domains, multi-domain proteins are prone to misfolding and\npotentially cytotoxic aggregation. In the cell, several factors ensure efficient folding. Folding begins co-\ntranslationally, while the ribosome still synthesizes the polypeptide. Molecular chaperones begin to\ninteract with the nascent multi-domain protein as soon as it emerges from the ribosome. Co-\ntranslational folding and chaperone interactions are recognized as crucial for efficient multi-domain\nprotein folding. However, these processes remain poorly defined at the molecular level, because it is\ntechnically challenging to study them. The goal of this project is to define principles of co-translational\nfolding and chaperone function to better understand how complex multi-domain proteins robustly reach\ntheir functional structures. We are using a combination of single-molecule biophysics and live-cell\nexperiments to accomplish this goal. With optical tweezers, we are studying the folding pathways of\nnascent multi-domain proteins at the single-molecule level. Manipulation of individual molecules is\nideally suited to resolve complex folding pathways of nascent proteins, elucidate the contributions of\nthe ribosome and molecular chaperones to the folding process, and determine how co-translational\nfolding and protein synthesis are coupled and regulated to ensure robust outcomes. These detailed in\nvitro studies are complemented by experiments in live cells that detect co-translational folding events\nin multi-domain proteins. Protein misfolding and aggregation, misregulation of protein synthesis and\ndecline of chaperone function are hallmarks of many aging-related diseases. Our studies may ultimately\nprovide a mechanistic basis for discovering novel therapeutic strategies to treat some of these\ndiseases.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract.\nThe human microbiome has a major role in the uptake and handling of nutrients, medications, and toxins; and is of great\nimmune system relevance. Evidence is mounting that it can affect aspects of neurologic function, brain activity, and\nbehavior via the \u2018gut-brain-axis\u2019. New propositions are that environmental exposures such as pesticides, metals, and\nair pollution influence the microbiome and the human immune system and that the microbiome plays a role in\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Here we propose the novel hypothesis that a) the microbiome is affected by chronic\nenvironmental exposures, specifically pesticides; and b) an altered gut microbiome composition or function contributes\nto the progression of neurodegeneration in PD. PD - a progressive neurodegenerative disease \u2013 has various non-motor\nsymptoms including gastro-intestinal (GI) features such as constipation and gastroparesis. Its pathologic hallmarks,\nnamely Lewy bodies and \u03b1-synuclein aggregates, have been found in the gut\u2019s enteric nervous system of PD patients\nalong with inflammation. The role of the gut microbiome in PD is underexplored and no study has addressed\nwhether toxins influence neurodegeneration via the microbiome. We previously developed a resource to investigate\nlong-term exposure to pesticides in humans, i.e. a geographic information system (GIS) model based on records from the\nCalifornia state pesticide use reporting (PUR) system. Capitalizing on our unique PUR exposure assessment tool and\nthe Parkinson's Disease Susceptibility Genes and Pesticides Study (PEG; R01 ES-010544) resources, we have joined forces\nwith Drs. Mayer and Jacob (UCLA Division of Digestive Diseases) - experts in brain-gut connection microbiome research -\nand propose to analyze the gut microbiome of 400 PD patients and 600 (200 age-matched household & 400 age-sex\nmatched community) controls using 16S ribosomal RNA to assess relative abundance of microbiota. Specifically, we will\nassess composition and function (using the predicted metagenome) in pesticide exposed vs. non-exposed controls and\nPD patients of different progression phenotypes. We will newly enroll 200 new-onset, of these 100 medication na\u00efve\n(MN) PD patients, to collect data on exposures, gut motility indicators, and fecal samples for metabolomics and culture\nbased experiments (before and after starting PD medications); assess differences in relative abundances of microbes\nover time using 16S ribosomal RNA and shotgun metagenomics and conduct metabolomics (blood or stool) analyses for\nnew onset PD patients (twice, longitudinally) and their household controls. We combine for this research our extensive\nexpertise in pesticide exposure assessment and studying PD progression in community-based patients, an exceptionally\nwell-characterized population living in a heavily pesticide exposed region, with the expertise of our UCLA GI team in\nbrain-gut axis research and the resources of the UCLA microbiome core. Our resources provide a strong and efficient\nplatform for addressing chronic environmental exposure to pesticides and their impacts on the gut microbiome and on\nneurodegeneration. This research will suggest novel pathways and prevention options for a growing elderly population\nwith chronic environmental exposures.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary / Abstract\n Degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and resulting\npathophysiology in basal ganglia circuits are central to the core motor impairments in Parkinson's Disease\n(PD). A variety of non-motor symptoms also are highly prevalent in PD, including motivation-related deficits\nmanifesting as apathy, fatigue, and depression, which have significant negative impacts on quality of life for\npatients and caregivers. However, we still have limited understanding of how nigrostriatal dopamine\ncontributes to specific aspects of motivated behavior spanning action selection and invigoration, particularly in\nthe context of cost-benefit decisions entailing effortful reward seeking. Recent work has increasingly\nhighlighted a remarkable diversity of midbrain dopamine neurons, and indeed some subpopulations of SNc\ndopamine neurons are preferentially vulnerable in PD. Defining the circuits regulating distinct nigrostriatal\ndopamine projections and determining their subtype-specific roles in motivated behavior will address critical\nknowledge gaps and represents important first steps toward developing more effective and specific treatments\nfor disorders such as PD. Our preliminary data suggest that manipulating afferent inputs can drive highly\ndivergent responses in different nigrostriatal dopamine projections. In particular, stimulating subthalamic\nnucleus glutamatergic neurons drives diametrically opposed responses in nigrostriatal dopamine projections to\ndistinct striatal subregions. Additionally, stimulating different populations of descending striatonigral projections\nevokes opposing patterns of dopamine release within the same region of the striatum. However, the circuit\ninteractions underlying these divergent effects remain unknown. Beyond its recognized role as a major basal\nganglia output nucleus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) provides critical inhibitory regulation of SNc\ndopamine neurons, and we propose that this may differ between dopamine neuron subtypes and mediate their\ndivergent responses to other basal ganglia afferent inputs. Given the anatomically segregated projections of\nSNc dopamine neuron subtypes to different striatal subregions, we will test the hypothesis that these dopamine\nsubpopulations differentially contribute to dissociable aspects of effortful reward-seeking behavior. The major\ngoals of this proposal are therefore 1) to characterize how SNr GABA neurons regulate divergent nigrostriatal\ndopamine pathways and potentially mediate pathway-specific responses to distinct afferent inputs, and 2) to\ndetermine the roles of these SNc dopamine neuron subpopulations in effort-based decisions and instrumental\naction invigoration. Collectively this research program will yield important advances in understanding basal\nganglia circuit regulation of diverse dopamine neuron subtypes and their contributions to motivated behaviors\noften impacted in PD.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nStudies in humans suggest that Neurexin1\u03b1 (Nrxn1\u03b1), a presynaptically expressed organizer of synaptic\nstructure, is a key genetic risk factor for multiple neuropsychiatric diseases, all of which exhibit impairments in\ngoal-directed processing. Given the pernicious effects of goal-directed dysfunction on daily quality of life, a better\nunderstanding of the underlying neurobiology \u2013 both at the molecular and neural circuit level - is strongly\nwarranted. Our prior work has developed quantitative behavioral and in vitro electrophysiological approaches\nwhile demonstrating that mice with mutations in Nrxn1\u03b1 are an excellent system to study alterations in neural\ncircuit activity driving impaired goal-directed behavior. Efficient goal-directed behavior relies on reinforcement,\nwhereby outcomes shape future actions, as well as flexibility, the ability to adapt to changes in contingencies or\ncontext. Both processes are thought to occur in part within the striatum, where excitatory inputs representing\nchoice-relevant information interact with neuromodulators, such as dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh),\nwhich signal information about rewards, surprise, and uncertainty from the external world. Nrxn1\uf061 is broadly\nexpressed in these cortico-striatal-thalamic circuits including the presynaptic terminals of striatal-targeting\ncortical and thalamic neurons, as well as within striatal cholinergic interneurons and striatal-targeting\ndopaminergic projections from the midbrain. Here we examine how Nrxn1\uf061 functions within midbrain dopamine\nneurons and striatal cholinergic interneurons, the major sources of striatal dopamine and acetylcholine,\nrespectively. We employ cell type specific Nrxn1\uf061 deletion together with acute slice recordings to mechanistically\naddress how Nrxn1\uf061 contributes to the striatal release of these key neuromodulators. In parallel, we use in vivo\nimaging of novel sensors for dopamine and acetylcholine to investigate how these modulators are altered during\nvalue-based choice tasks in both circuit-specific and brain-wide Nrxn1\uf061 KOs. We will correlate abnormal\nneuromodulatory signals with abnormalities in choice behavior, focusing on reinforcement processes and choice\nflexibility. To probe the functional relevance of altered neuromodulatory signals for behavior, we optogenetically\nimpose abnormal ACh and DA signals in WT mice and observe impacts on choice selection and flexibility. Finally,\nwe examine how Nrxn1\uf061 mutations impact striatal processing during selection of actions via in vivo recordings\nin wildtype and Nrxn1\uf061 KO mice. The proposed work will inform us of how mutations in Nrxn1\uf061 alter striatal\ncholinergic and dopaminergic signals and striatal processing of goal-directed actions, while providing a\nframework to understand the diversity of goal-directed dysfunction seen across neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nSalient signals, like aversive stimulation and reward, should be faithfully detected, and processed by the\nnervous system to generate an adaptive action. One of the universal circuit mechanisms linked to salient signal\nprocessing in cortical operation is the activation of dis-inhibitory neurons by subcortical afferents. Aversive\nsignals and reward delivery profoundly excite cortical GABAergic interneurons expressing vasoactive intestinal\npolypeptide (VIP), which selectively inhibit other GABAergic interneurons, leading to the dis-inhibition of\ncortical pyramidal cells. In this project, we propose to reveal the functional diversity of VIP interneurons in a\ncortical structure. The central idea of our project rests on our earlier anatomical findings that distinct groups of\nVIP interneurons innervate different types of GABAergic interneurons, observations that prompted us to\nsuggest a heterogeneity in their activity during various cortical processes. However, recent imaging studies\nreported rather similar activity of VIP interneurons following aversive and appetitive stimuli. In contrast to these\nin vivo imaging data, our preliminary experiments obtained in a frontal cortical area of anesthetized mice have\nrevealed a considerable heterogeneity in VIP interneuron spiking upon delivery of foot shocks. Building on\nthese preliminary results, our goal is to determine the functional complexity of cortical VIP interneurons,\nincluding their connectivity and operation in awake mice. To achieve these aims, we will combine viral\ntechniques, neuroanatomical methods, in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology with optogenetics in three different\ngenetically modified mouse lines. The results of this project will uncover the heterogeneity of spike responses\ngenerated by genetically defined dis-inhibitory VIP interneurons upon salient signal delivery and their\ndownstream effects on postsynaptic partners within the local microcircuits. Our project will reveal the\ncomplexity of dis-inhibitory circuit motifs in cortical networks, which may be a general phenomenon in a cortex-\nwide manner. In addition, our results will help form novel concepts underlying the pathological operation of\ncortical circuits linked to deficits in attention and salient signal detection that typifies many malfunctional\ncognitive processes, including those observed in schizophrenia, autism, and attention deficit.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\n Patients with major mental illness (MMI; major depressive, bipolar, schizophrenia spectrum, other psychotic\ndisorders; posttraumatic stress disorder) are diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (AUD) at higher rates than the\ngeneral population and experience negative consequences and long-term suffering as a result. There are FDA\napproved medications for AUD (MAUD) that have demonstrated efficacy. That these medications are underutilized in\nMMI patients with comorbid AUD represents a gap in care: evidence-based AUD treatments exist but MMI patients \u2013\nmany from marginalized racial, ethnic, and SES groups - are largely excluded from benefiting from them. In primary\ncare and mental health settings, prescribers report that MAUD is best provided in specialty addictions service settings\neven though it is hard to connect with these services for MMI patients. However, the psychiatric treatment setting can\neasily offer MAUD. Many MMI patients are highly connected to their psychiatry treatment providers. They are taking\npsychiatric medications prescribed by their psychiatry treatment team; MAUD could easily be offered and monitored in\nthis context. APA practice guidelines state that MAUD can have efficacy outside of specialty addictions services.\nServices in psychiatry treatment settings are provided by a team in which prescribers focus on medication treatments\nin brief monthly appointments and non-prescribing clinicians provide psychosocial interventions in more frequent\nappointments. Implementing a process that identifies patients, educates them on MAUD, prescribes MAUD and\nmonitors use, and integrates MAUD with other psychotherapies offers the best chance for increasing MMI patients\u2019\naccess to MAUD.\n This project will pilot test an implementation facilitation (IF) intervention to increase MAUD education and\nprescribing for MMI/AUD patients in three psychiatry treatment clinics. Guided by the integrated Promoting Action on\nResearch Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework, an external facilitator will work with each clinics\u2019\ninternal champion to (1) provide clinic level education on MAUD in non-specialty care settings, (2) provide clinic level\ntraining in using a standardized AUD screen, documenting screening results in the EHR, and documenting AUD\ndiagnosis in the EHR, (3) help internal champions use an audit and feedback system for weekly review of MAUD\neducation and prescribing, (4) help internal champions do weekly care coordination of MMI/AUD patients, and (5)\nmake educational materials on MAUD available on site to MMI patients so they are informed about these treatment\noptions. Internal champions and clinics will have access to consultation from a MAUD clinician expert. These activities\nwill take place across pre-implementation and implementation phases and will be followed by a post-IF sustainment\nperiod during which clinics and champions continue implementation on their own. Formative Evaluation activities will\ntake place throughout; at the end of the sustainment phase, MAUD outcomes will be assessed.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Summary\n The development of efficacious medications for AUD remains a high research priority with current emphases\non identifying novel molecular targets and efficiently screening new compounds. Pharmacological modulation of the\nkynurenine pathway (KP) represents a promising novel target for AUD. The KP is a complex enzymatic cascade with\neach step producing biologically active metabolites that are critically involved in diverse physiological and pathological\nprocesses. Chronic alcohol exposure produces dysregulation of the KP, particularly as evidenced by decreased levels\nof the neuroprotective metabolite kynurenic acid (KYNA) and increased levels of the neurotoxic metabolite quinolinic\nacid (QUIN). This metabolic shift is associated with various alcohol-related pathologies in animals and humans. Thus,\na medication that targets the KP to restore KYNA and attenuate QUIN levels may be an effective treatment for AUD.\nThe enzyme kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) is a major gatekeeper of the KP and resultant KYNA levels. KMO\ninhibition shifts the KP towards KYNA production in brain and away from QUIN production. Critically, KMO inhibition in\nrodents, through its increase in brain KYNA levels, decreases alcohol self-administration, preference, cue-reactivity,\nand relapse behaviors. However, KMO-inhibitors have not been tested in humans because of presumed lack of\navailability. Diclofenac is an FDA-approved Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug that was recently discovered to\ninhibit KMO activity. Consistent with KMO inhibition, diclofenac increases KYNA levels in the brain and periphery of\nrodents. However, it remains unknown whether diclofenac increases KYNA levels and affects alcohol-related\nbehaviors in humans at approved, safe dosages. In a Phase Ia/b proof of concept study, we will test the\npharmacological mechanism, optimal dosing, tolerability, and initial efficacy of diclofenac as a potential novel\ntreatment for AUD. We will conduct a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalating, placebo-controlled, cross-over study\nin which individuals with AUD (n=24) complete four sessions where they receive diclofenac (25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg)\nor placebo. Our primary aim is to identify the dose by which diclofenac, vs. placebo, produces changes to the KP\nindicative of KMO inhibition (e.g., increasing KYNA levels).

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nGABAergic cortical interneurons (cINs) play critical roles in balancing, synchronizing, and gating brain activity\nby inhibiting other neurons. Their malfunction, especially those of medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived\ncINs, has been associated with various neurodevelopmental brain disorders, such as schizophrenia (SCZ) and\nautism spectrum disorders (ASD). Considering the fact that the divergence between human brains and rodent\nbrains has resulted in the failure of many central nervous system (CNS) therapeutics validated in rodent\nmodels, it is critical to study human neurons to better understand the mechanisms of these cIN-associated\nbrain disorders. Human fetal brain tissues are not accessible for mechanistic studies, but we have developed a\nmethod to efficiently generate homogeneous populations of MGE-type human cINs from pluripotent stem cells\n(PSCs) of healthy or diseased subjects. We have extensively characterized them and demonstrated their\nauthenticity and functionality, making it possible to study the converging functional consequences of complex\ngenetics in real patient neurons, which cannot be studied in mouse neurons due to a lack of conservation of\nnon-coding regions, where most of risk loci are present. However, in vitro cultured neurons lack other critical\ncomponents of the brain environment, such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and blood vessels,\nwhich can significantly impact their function. There have been efforts to optimize in vitro culture systems to\nbetter recapitulate in vivo physiological environments by adding other brain cellular components, but there are\nstill limitations as to how closely they can simulate in vivo situations. To resolve this issue, in our previous\nstudy, we pioneered human neuron-mouse brain chimeras to study the function of human SCZ neurons in\nphysiological environments. Although we were able to successfully identify SCZ cIN-intrinsic connectivity\ndeficits in mouse brains, we were not able to analyze the impacts of grafted neurons on brain circuits and\nbehaviors due to the presence of healthy mouse neurons in the grafted mice. Thus, in this proposed study, we\nwill perform brain-region-specific cIN-ablation in NodScid gamma (NSG) mice, followed by the replacement of\nablated host cINs with human cINs to generate region-specific humanized cIN chimeras. Based on previous\nstudies, including ours, that show successful restoration of compromised mouse inhibition by grafted human\ncINs, these mice will allow us to analyze the functional impacts of grafted human cINs on the brain circuits and\nbehaviors in physiological in vivo environments. This novel physiological model system will help us tease apart\ncell-type- and brain-region-specific disease mechanisms for complex brain disorders, and aid in developing\nnovel therapeutics.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Across species, multisensory integration (MSI) is used to accurately and rapidly localize objects in\nthe environment. This process is presumed to rely on the correct organization of sensory inputs into\ntopographically aligned maps of egocentric space. However this idea has not been rigorously tested.\nMSI and spatial orienting behaviors are compromised in many developmental disorders including\nAutism, Schizophrenia and ADHD, highlighting the significance of understanding the developmental\nmechanisms that establish effective MSI-dependent behaviors.\n The overall objective of this application is to determine the mechanisms used to integrate visual and\nauditory maps of location in the mouse superior colliculus (SC) and identify the behavioral\nconsequences to animals deficient in these mechanisms. The central hypothesis is that sensory\nexperience is used to align auditory and visual maps of space in the SC; furthermore, accurate\nalignment of the two maps is required for effective MSI and robust natural spatial orienting behavior.\nAim 1 seeks to determine both the developmental window in which MSI forms and the critical period\nof sensory influence. We will present a wake mice with spatially restricted visual and auditory stimuli\nwhile recording neuronal responses in the SC using high-density probes. Analyzing this data will\ndetermine the spatial receptive fields (RFs) of visual, auditory and visual/auditory multimodal neurons.\nThis will be done at key developmental stages plus or minus visual or auditory deprivation.\n The goal of Aim 2 is to quantify how developmental changes in multisensory experience alter\nnatural stimulus localization behaviors. Mice innately hunt insects and their ability to capture them is\nmost efficient when they have access to multisensory cues. Of note, orienting behavior during prey\ncapture is disrupted in mouse models of ASD. Prey capture behaviors such as time to cricket detection,\nspatial accuracy and precision of pursuit, and time to capture success will be measured in mice at\ndifferent ages and in those deprived of early vision or audition. This aim will reveal the role that sensory\nexperience plays in generating natural localization behavior.\n Experiments in Aim 3 will test the longstanding hypothesis that the alignment and integration of\nvisual and auditory inputs in the SC rely on the visual map as a template. We will record the auditory and\nvisual response properties as in Aim 1 from two populations of mice: those with scrambled or duplicated\nvisual map topography via perturbations in EphA/ephrin-A signaling or shifted via prism goggles. We can\nthen determine if the auditory map rearranges to align and integrate with the duplicated, scrambled or\nshifted visual map and, if so, how these changes lead to altered orienting behavior during prey capture.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nSchizophrenia (SCZ) is a highly heritable and complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Remarkable advances\nhave been made recently in SCZ genetic studies with an increasing number of risk loci reaching genome-wide\nsignificance; however, gleaning biological insight from these loci has been challenging. The majority of SCZ risk\nloci are located in non-coding regions. As such, it is hypothesized that they function by regulating distal gene\nexpression via 3D chromatin interactions. However, it has yet to be determined which loci are operational in\nwhich cells, at what time points, and with what impact. Recent genomic analyses showed enriched SCZ\nheritability in human fetal brains rather than adult brains, suggesting the role of SCZ risk loci in modulating fetal\ndevelopment for increased SCZ risks. Thus, unraveling SCZ risk loci function during development will be critical\nfor understanding genetic influences on SCZ risks. Genetic influences on gene expression (e.g. expression\nquantitative trait loci (eQTLs)) are cell-type-specific, and sometimes confer opposing effects depending on the\ncell type, underscoring the importance of cell-type-specific studies using homogeneous cell populations for a\nclear mechanistic understanding. Parvalbumin (PV)- or somatostatin (SST)-expressing medial ganglionic\neminence (MGE)-derived cortical interneurons (cINs) are consistently affected in SCZ brains. More importantly,\nSCZ heritability is shown to be enriched in MGE cells in human fetal brains, necessitating the study of these\ncells to understand the mechanisms of SCZ risk loci. Although there are no postmortem fetal SCZ tissues for\nmechanistic study, in vitro differentiation of iPSC\u2014which well recapitulates early embryonic development\u2014\nprovides developmental SCZ brain cells with the same genetic makeup as patient brains. We established\nmethods for the efficient generation of homogeneous populations of MGE-derived cINs from healthy control\n(HC) and SCZ iPSCs. We also extensively validated their functionality and authenticity both in vitro and in vivo,\nincluding robust migration and synaptic integration into host brains that results in efficient inhibitory regulation of\nhost circuitry in transplanted mice. Using an unprecedentedly large number of iPSCs to provide homogeneous\npopulations of HC vs SCZ fetal cINs for mechanistic studies, we will address our hypothesis that SCZ risk loci\nactive in developmental MGE-type cINs regulate distal gene expression via 3D chromatin interactions.\nEmploying transcriptome analysis, PrediXcan analysis, and Micro-C analysis, we will map SCZ risk loci with\nunknown functions to the risk genes they regulate in these vulnerable cell populations during development.\nDevelopmental cIN-specific genetic influences on gene expression, identified based on multiple lines of\ncorroborating evidence, will be functionally validated using CRISPRi/CRISPRa approaches. This unbiased\ngenome-wide comprehensive data set from developmental MGE-type cINs with functional validation will provide\na road map for unravelling the genetic basis of developmental SCZ risks and help us identify mechanism-based\nnovel therapeutic targets.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nWhen making a decision we can use our understanding of available action-outcome relationships to prospectively\nevaluate the consequences of our potential actions and choose the one that is currently most beneficial. This goal-\ndirected strategy is, thus, quite flexible, allowing us to readily adapt when circumstances change. For example,\nwhen ordering dinner, you consider how nutritious and delicious each potential meal will be and will avoid options\nthat you\u2019ve just had for lunch or do not meet your current nutritional needs. But we don\u2019t always think about the\nconsequences of our behavior. Usually this is fine. Such habits are a way for our brain to efficiently execute routine\nbehaviors. But disrupted goal-directed learning and overreliance on habit can cause inadequate consideration of\nconsequences, inflexibility, a lower threshold for compulsivity, and disrupted decision making. This can contribute\nto aspects of numerous diseases, including substance use disorder (SUD), obsessive-compulsive disorder,\nobesity, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and autism. Chronic stress can attenuate goal-directed learning and\ntip the balance of behavioral control towards habit. This is one major avenue through which chronic stress can\npredispose one to SUD and other mental illnesses. But we know very little of how chronic stress promotes habit\nformation. The overarching goal of this proposal is, thus, to expose the neuronal circuits through which chronic\nstress promotes premature habit formation. This work will help us to understand how chronic stress can promote\nmaladaptive and pathological habits, which will be critical for understanding and treating SUD and mental illness.\nFilling this gap is especially important because chronic stress contributes to mental health disparities in the US.\n Recent evidence from our team has suggested that central (CeA) and basolateral (BLA) amygdala projections\nto the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) may be critical conduits for stress-potentiated habit. Based on prior and our\npreliminary data, our novel, comparative hypothesis is that BLA\uf0e0DMS and CeA\uf0e0DMS promote and oppose,\nrespectively, goal-directed learning and associated neuronal activity in the DMS and that chronic stress amplifies\nCeA\uf0e0DMS and attenuates BLA\uf0e0DMS pathway activity to promote premature habit formation. We will test this\nwith a multifaceted approach including projection-specific optical neuronal activity monitoring and manipulation,\ncell-type specific, cellular resolution, microendoscopic calcium imaging with pathway-specific chemogenetic\nmanipulations, a model of chronic stress, and theory-driven behavioral tools. We will expose how ensembles of\nDMS neurons organize their activity during goal-directed and habit learning and how this is impacted by chronic\nstress. We will reveal the functions of two understudied amygdala-striatal pathways in goal-directed and habit\nlearning and how they are influenced by chronic stress. More broadly, we will uncover neuronal circuitry through\nwhich chronic stress promotes habit formation. This will provide a critical basic science foundation for our long-\nterm goal of understanding of how chronic stress is a conduit to pathological habits.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "The role of Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 2 (BAI2) in synaptic structural organization and functional dynamics",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nExcitatory ionotropic synapses and their associated dendritic spines play critical roles in fundamental\ninformation processing within the brain. The development and morphology of these synapses are highly\nfunctionally relevant; previous studies have established that patients with many different neurodevelopmental,\nneurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric conditions are clinically defined by synaptopathies. Synaptopathies,\nor disease at the level of the synapse, includes inappropriate loss of synapses and spines, enhanced or\nlowered synapse and spine development, and aberrations to the synaptic structure that leads to dysfunctional\nsignaling. The Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor (BAI) subfamily of neuronal adhesion G-protein coupled\nreceptors (aGPCRs) are a three-member postsynaptic family of receptors predicted to form trans-synaptic\ncomplexes to direct synaptogenesis and synapse structural development. BAI2 is the least studied of these\nproteins, with no established role in neuronal or synaptic development. BAI2 also appears to be the most\nfunctionally non-redundant member of the BAI family. Though whole exome data from human patients with\nautism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder suggests all BAI proteins are implicated in these\nconditions, BAI2 does not bind the same presynaptic proteins as BAI1 and BAI3. Furthermore, a gain-of-\nfunction mutation to BAI2 is the putative cause of a rare spastic paraparesis condition in humans, and loss-of-\nfunction mutations are associated with hyperactive behavior in mice. Addressing the fundamental role and\nmolecular mechanism of BAI2 thus can help us understand both basic synapse development, and potentially\ninform future studies into treatments of psychiatric and central nervous system-derived motor disorders. To this\nend, my data on BAI2 suggests that the protein localizes to the PSD and promotes both pre- and postsynaptic\ndevelopment. I propose to further define the role of BAI2 in synapse and spine development by delineating the\nfunctional domains that regulate synapse development (Aim 1.1), quantifying nanostructural changes to\nsynaptic structures (Aim 1.2), and describing functional deficits (Aim 1.3) induced by loss of BAI2. In the future,\nI plan to pursue a postdoctoral position investigating real-time changes to excitatory and inhibitory synaptic\nnanodomains and signaling in baseline, plasticity, and disease conditions (Aim 2).",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "The plasma-membrane monoamine transporters (MATs), including the serotonin (SERT), norepinephrine (NET)\nand dopamine (DAT) transporters, serve a pivotal role in limiting monoamine-mediated neurotransmission\nthrough the reuptake of their respective neurotransmitters. MATs are targets for the treatment of numerous\nneurological disorders such as depression, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and they\nserve as target proteins for major drugs of abuse such as amphetamine and cocaine. The continuing need for\ntherapeutic drugs to treat brain disorders involving aberrant monoamine signaling provides a compelling reason\nto further our understanding of transporter function and to identify novel ways of targeting them.\nThis project builds on our recent discovery of an allosteric site (A2) within the MATs that can serve as a target\nsite for modulating their activity. Previous experiments in our group targeted the allosteric A2 site in SERT and\nidentified molecules that interact with this site and display remarkable transporter-modulating activities. These\ncompounds have revealed that engaging this site modulate MAT activity in entirely novel ways, including\naffecting the interaction with transporter ligands such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and\npsychostimulants. In corresponding experiments on DAT, we have identified compounds, KM822 and sydnocarb\namong others, that similarly modifies DAT function. We find that these compounds interfere with the interaction\nof DAT with exogenous ligands and attenuates psychostimulant-elicited behaviors in rodents. Computational\nsimulations further support the premise that compounds interacting with the allosteric A2 site can allow transport\nwhile interfering with the interaction of the transporter with exogenous ligands like cocaine.\nThe overarching hypothesis of this project is that the specific engagement of the allosteric site in DAT will provide\nvaluable information regarding mechanisms of the dopamine transport process and could provide novel\ntherapeutic avenues for developing DAT-based medications. We propose to pursue this idea by further\ncharacterizing the compounds to study allosteric modulation of DAT. We will in Aim 1 elucidate mechanisms of\nallosteric transporter modulation through computational modelling and molecular simulations coupled with\nfunctional and biochemical studies. In aim 2 we will evaluate the in vivo utility of the compounds by examining\ntheir effects on psychostimulant-elicited behaviors in rodents. Finally, in Aim 3, we will employ structure-based\ndesign to identify A2-specific compounds with improved properties. Consequently, the successful completion of\nthis project will result in the development of novel ligands of DAT that can be employed as experimental tools to\nprovide critical mechanistic information regarding allosteric transporter modulation. Furthermore, the design and\ndevelopment of novel allosteric modulators of DAT will enable a systematic evaluation of the beneficial potential\nof these compounds to ultimately provide new therapeutic opportunities.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Synapse-specific effects of synaptically released zinc: implications for auditory processing",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nMany regions of the brain including the cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and limbic structures are\nhighly enriched with synaptic zinc. Synaptic zinc (as Zn2+) is loaded into presynaptic vesicles by zinc\ntransporter 3 (ZnT3), where it is coreleased with glutamate during synaptic transmission. Since synaptic\nzinc inhibits AMPA and NMDA receptors \u2013 which mediate the majority of excitatory glutamatergic\ntransmission in the brain \u2013 synaptic zinc can modulate excitatory synaptic signaling. ZnT3 KO mice (which\nlack synaptic zinc) display a range of cognitive and sensory impairments and demonstrate behavioral\ndeficits associated with autism and schizophrenia. Mounting evidence from human populations shows\nthat mutations in certain zinc transporters are linked with major neurological disorders such as\nschizophrenia. Together, these findings strongly suggest that synaptic zinc signaling is important for\nneuronal processing. The goals of this project are to understand how synaptic zinc contributes to normal\nneuronal function and how disruptions in zinc signaling are linked to pathological neuronal conditions.\nWe will take three complimentary experimental approaches to these questions. 1) Using ex vivo brain\nslice preparations and optogenetic stimulation paradigms, we dissect the roles of synaptic zinc in shaping\nthe dynamics of synaptic transmission at specific synaptic connections in cortical microcircuits. 2) Using\nin vivo 2-photon calcium imaging, we assess the roles of synaptic zinc in shaping the sensory-evoked\nresponses of specific classes of auditory cortical neurons in awake mice. 3) Using in vitro high-throughput\nscreening assays and rational compound design approaches, we are designing novel tools to modulate\nthe function of specific zinc transport proteins. Together these approaches will allow us to answer\nfundamental questions concerning the role of synaptic zinc in brain function and provide new mechanistic\ninsights into endogenous mechanisms that shape synaptic and neural processing.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Designing belonging: Advancing science on environmental modifications to foster activity engagement and social connection among individuals with serious mental illness",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\n People with serious mental illness (SMI) experience dramatically worse health and longevity than the\ngeneral population, which is exacerbated by extremely high rates of loneliness and social isolation. Both social\nisolation (lack of social supports) and loneliness (the subjective experience of isolation) are highly predictive of\nearly mortality. Although social isolation and loneliness are inherently relational, influenced by contextual\nfactors, and prevalent among people with SMI, very little is known about how to design community mental\nhealth environments that foster social connection (\u201csocial architecture\u201d). Thus, the goal of this K01 is to lay the\nfoundation for an innovative, impactful research career focused on reducing social isolation among people with\nSMI through environmental design. My research plan employs a rigorous, mixed-method design to: 1) identify\nenvironmental features associated with two behavioral mechanisms of action: activity engagement and social\ninteraction; 2) examine associations between activity engagement, social interaction, and self-reported\nloneliness and support; and 3) feasibility test the co-design and implementation of an environmental\nmodification to support social connection. To do this, I will first conduct socio-spatial observations of activity\nengagement and social interaction in four mental health Clubhouses in Hawaii. These are community-based\npsychosocial rehabilitation centers that are highly interested in reducing loneliness among their members.\nObservation data will be paired with survey data (N=150) to examine associations between observed activity\nengagement and social interaction and self-reported loneliness and social support. Second, spatial\nobservations and social network data will be visualized to refine a conceptual model interlinking engagement\nand social interaction. These visualizations will be shared with participating Clubhouses to contextualize the\nidentified patterns in engagement and social interaction and to co-identify potentially modifiable environmental\nfeatures associated with them. Third, an environmental intervention co-design process will be conducted in one\nClubhouse and the intervention will be implemented. Feasibility data on the co-design process and\nmodification of the environmental intervention protocol will be collected through field notes and a final focus\ngroup and subsequently analyzed qualitatively. This research will be carried out with close mentorship from a\nteam of highly accomplished senior scholars: Drs. Henwood, Wenzel, Salzer, Valente, Wilson, and Stark. Their\nwork is directly aligned with my career and training goals, which focus on three intersecting areas of expertise:\n1) socio-spatial methods (GIS, social network analysis and ecological momentary assessment), 2) theory\nlinking environmental design, human behaviors, and health, and 3) environmental intervention co-design based\non community-based participatory research principles. This K01 builds on my unique clinical and theoretical\nbackground as an occupational therapist and community psychologist and lays the foundation for an\ninnovative, highly impactful career focused on reducing social isolation and loneliness among people with SMI.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Homeostatic Reset as a New Therapeutic Paradigm for Slow Progression Diseases",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\n This project responds to NIH Directors TRA RFA-RM-20-013 and will test the hypothesis that homeostatic\nrestoration of small GTPase signaling to modify Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\npathogenesis is a game-changing therapeutic approach compared to unidirectional targeting. If proven, this new\nand innovative paradigm will have far-reaching and transformative impact for targeting other chronic diseases\nand disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and drug addiction.\n The predominant and conventional therapeutic strategies in treating human diseases are unidirectionally\ninhibiting or stimulating affected biological processes. However, in many chronic diseases such as AD and ALS,\ncomplete inhibition or activation of the affected signaling events may themselves promote diseases. Disease\nprogression can also be spatiotemporal, with initial activation followed by inhibition or vice versa, as well as\nactivation versus inhibition at different brain regions. Thus, simple unidirectional targeting may itself be a major\nreason that no drugs have successfully prevented, reversed or even modified the disease course for such\nneurodegenerative disorders. To overcome this formidable challenge, new therapeutic paradigms must be\ninvestigated. One approach is to restore homeostatic balance instead of completely inhibiting or activating the\naffected signaling pathways. This approach is largely untested for AD and ALS but is broadly significant because\nmany other complex diseases also exhibit homeostatic imbalance and spatiotemporal dysregulation of signaling\npathways, making the use of inhibitors or activators ineffective if used inappropriately.\n This TRA project proposes to restore the homeostatic balance of Rho and Rab family small GTPase\nsignaling, which is spatiotemporally dysregulated in AD and ALS. The classical Rho GTPases include RhoA,\nRac1, and Cdc42, in which RhoA often acts in opposition to Rac1 and Cdc42 to control protein processing and\ntrafficking as well as synaptic remodeling. Rab GTPases additionally control ER stress and protein aggregation.\nOur project will apply innovative dual function small molecules to investigate this antagonism for restoring\ntheir homeostatic balance. We will determine the effects of their modulation on AD and ALS hallmark proteins\nand pathogenesis in mouse models. If successful, this project will deliver novel first-in-class drug leads, and the\nnew therapeutic paradigm will transform the entire AD and ALS drug development landscape and beyond.\n In summary, our proposal provides a strong rationale for the transformative impact of establishing\nhomeostatic targeting at defective signaling processes in AD and ALS. With a multi-institution and multi-\ndisciplinary approach, this project will lead to novel and significant insights into whether targeting homeostatic\nbalances of defective signaling can modify AD and ALS disease course, providing a pioneering example of\napplying the same approach for future targeting of other chronic and slow progression diseases.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nNumerous observations both in humans and in experimental animals support the notion that acetylcholine (ACh)\nis important for learning and memory. However, the cellular and circuit mechanisms through which ACh\u2019s\nbiochemical control over the excitability of cortical cells reorganizes cortical dynamics and mediate learning and\nlearning related plasticity, or other cognitive functions, remain poorly understood. This application takes\nadvantage of technological advances in the last decade that facilitate exploring how cortical neurons are\nmodulated under physiological circumstances of ACh release, as well as determine the contribution of these\nmodulations to the physiology of cortical neurons and networks during behavior. We have implemented a simple\nassociative learning task that has been shown to depend on changes in cortical circuitry in the whisker\nrepresentation area of the primary somatosensory cortex (wS1) and is well suited to investigating the cellular\nand circuit mechanisms by which ACh promotes associative learning. We have obtained preliminary evidence\nthat acquisition of the association of the conditioned stimulus and a reward requires ACh release in wS1. The\ngoal of this exploratory R21 grant is to demonstrate feasibility of several experimental strategies to study the\ncellular and circuit mechanisms by which ACh promotes learning in the task we have implemented and to begin\ntesting hypotheses about cholinergic mechanisms responsible for the behavior. For these goals, we propose two\nAims. In Aim 1, we investigate the requirement of ACh during different phases of the associative learning task.\nIn Aim 1A, we use 2-photon microscopy with a genetically-encoded fluorescent ACh sensor to investigate the\nmagnitude and time course of ACh release in wS1 during the acquisition and consolidation of the associative\nlearning and during performance of the task after the association has been learned. In Aim 1B we develop a\nchemogenetics strategy for the transient suppression of cholinergic activity in wS1 during specific phases of the\nassociative learning. In Aim 2 we begin to develop a pharmaco-genetic strategy using cell-specific genetic\nablation of specific cholinergic receptors in different types of excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons to\nbegin to discover cholinergic actions that are important for associative learning in our task. These experiments\nwill help develop a framework for understanding how dysfunction in ACh signaling results in neurocognitive\ndisorders associated with the cholinergic system, and provide insights into potential cell-type specific\ninterventions.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nNovelty and surprise have long been known to facilitate learning and memory. At a functional level this makes sense;\nunexpected events have to be learned about so they can be predicted and responded to appropriately in the future. At a\npsychological level, surprising events have been shown to enhance memory because they induce rehearsal. Subjects tend\nto \u201cthink about\u201d unexpected events more than familiar ones after they occur. This has been observed directly in humans\n(explicit rehearsal) and indirectly in animals (implicit rehearsal). In both cases, the memory enhancement can be\neliminated by disrupting rehearsal with a distractor stimulus that is presented immediately after the novel event.\nPresenting the same distractor stimulus several minutes later has no effect. This suggests rehearsal is short-lasting and\ndistinct from the process of memory consolidation, which stabilizes new information for several hours after learning. In\naddition to increasing rehearsal, novel events also trigger the release of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA), which\nare known to enhance synaptic plasticity. Blocking receptors for these neuromodulators in the hippocampus prevents\nanimals from forming new spatial and contextual memories. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that surprising\nevents enhance memory because they induce catecholamine release at the same time the hippocampus is actively\nrehearsing/replaying new information. Our preliminary data demonstrate that NE and DA are both released in the\nhippocampus during and after the presentation of an unexpected aversive stimulus. At the same time, there is an increase\nin sharp-wave ripple oscillations (SWRs), which are known to contain replay sequences for recently encountered stimuli.\nConsequently, we will test the hypothesis above by monitoring and manipulating catecholamine release in real-time\nduring an aversive learning task while simultaneously recording oscillations and single unit activity in the hippocampus.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "The Role of Mental Imagery in Perceptual Abnormality Formation in Individuals at Clinical High-Risk for Psychosis",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary/Abstract\nTheories about the origin of perceptual abnormalities (attenuated hallucinations) have been evoked for\ncenturies. One competitive theory is that perceptual abnormalities can be explained by atypical predictive\ncoding. The predictive coding theory states that individuals use prior knowledge to create a mental model of\nthe environment and that mismatches of expectancy and experience lead to an updating of the prior mental\nmodel. In people on the psychosis spectrum, more weight is given to the prior models and belief updating does\nnot occur. According to this theory, people who experience perceptual abnormalities misattribute the prior\nexpectation as a sensation leading to a perceptual experience. Adjacently, recent research in non-psychiatric\npopulations has investigated the mechanisms of mental imagery. When imagined signals are strong enough,\nthey can become subjectively indistinguishable from reality. Taking this novel research into account, it may be\npossible that the vividness of mental imagery may affect the strength of prior beliefs and make it more or less\nlikely to experience perceptual abnormalities. Thus far, the role of mental imagery in the predictive coding\ntheory of perceptual abnormalities has not been explored. The proposed study will examine the role of mental\nimagery in predictive coding using samples of people at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) who experience\nperceptual abnormalities (N = 40), CHR individuals who do not experience perceptual abnormalities (N = 40),\nand healthy controls (N = 40). Participants will partake in a clinical and cognitive assessment, including two\nnovel mental imagery tasks that instruct participants to imagine a sound or image and test their ability to\ndifferentiate between imagined and real stimuli later in the task. Additionally, participants will complete a self-\nreport questionnaire about their mental imagery and perform a predictive coding task. Using this data, the\nstudy will investigate three aims to understand whether the vividness of mental imagery relates to the presence\nof perceptual abnormalities and if this improves the predictive coding model. Aim 1: validate the mental\nimagery task and mechanisms in the CHR population. Aim 2: assess whether the vividness of mental imagery\nrelates to the severity of perceptual abnormalities. Aim 3: examine whether mental imagery can be\nincorporated into the predictive coding model. Training Plan: to complete this project and build an independent\nresearch career the applicant will (a) develop an understanding of theories and mechanisms of hallucination\nformation, (b) gain comprehensive experience with building and interpreting computational models, and (c)\nlearn the principles and applications of structural equation modeling. This training will be accomplished through\nregular meetings with a team of expert scholars, coursework, workshops, and attending conferences. Training\nEnvironment: The training will take place at Northwestern University, which offers an excellent and\ncollaborative training environment. The environment, alongside the proposed study and training plan, will\nposition the applicant to launch a career researching the influence of cognition on positive symptoms.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nApproximately 1 in 3 American adolescents have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder; 3 in 20 with a mood\ndisorder, with 1 in 3 female adolescents experiencing at least one major depressive episode. The onset of\npsychiatric disorders can occur in early life, potentially leading to a reduced quality of life due to a disruption in\nemotional, psychological, and/or social development. Mental illness during youth may also result in long-term\nconsequences, including an increased risk of mental health challenges and diminished quality of life in adulthood.\nInflammation in the central nervous system (neuroinflammation) is thought to underlie anxiety and mood\ndisorders, yet there remain no broadly effective therapies. The neuroinflammatory pathology may be, in part,\ncaused by circadian dysregulation of the neuroimmune system. The circadian clock is critical for controlling\nbiological processes, generating time-of-day differences in gene expression, hormone release, and behaviors;\nhowever, circadian rhythms dampen in psychiatric disorders. Although the percentage of individuals experiencing\npsychiatric disorders concomitant with circadian disturbances remains unknown, circadian disruptions and sleep-\nwake disturbances are used as diagnosable criteria for neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, circadian\ndysregulation may be a potential biomarker and signal for early intervention in anxiety- and mood disorder-\nrelated pathology. The immune system is tightly regulated by the circadian clock, and recent evidence\ndemonstrates circadian regulation of neuroimmune system components: microglia, meninges, and choroid\nplexus. Microglia, the primary immune cell of the brain, are rhythmic cells that can trigger a release of\ninflammatory molecules when activated, potentially triggering a suite of physiological and behavioral alterations.\nThe meninges and choroid plexus serve as immune surveillance sites and can also release inflammatory signals\nthat influence the activity of microglia. Together, these components may provide insights into the pathogenesis\nand pathophysiology of mental disorders. However, the ontogeny of circadian rhythms in the neuroimmune\nsystem has not been well-documented. Early developmental periods offer a potential window for intervention\nand prevention of neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, we hypothesize that circadian rhythms in the neuroimmune\nsystem emerge early in life, and perturbations during development will alter neuroimmune function that leads to\nbehavioral changes. This proposal addresses the following specific aims: First, establish the development of\ncircadian rhythms in \u201cclock\u201d and inflammatory genes in critical neuroimmune tissues; second, reveal whether\nearly life environmental and genetic perturbations to the circadian system lead to long-term behavioral changes.\nThis contribution will be significant because our results will identify temporal windows of high and low\nneuroimmune reactivity during development. We expect these results will uniquely combine expertise in\ncircadian biology, immunology, and behavioral neuroscience to identify a novel role for biological rhythms in\nregulating neuroinflammatory pathology and mood-related behaviors via the neuroimmune system.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nClinical predictors are now firmly incorporated into routine standard-of-care in many fields of medicine, in contrast\nwith Psychiatry where quantitative predictors that guide clinical decision-making remain extremely\nlimited. Psychosis-related disorders are responsible for a substantial public health burden, for which there are\nsignificant unmet needs that would be subserved by clinical predictors. For example, long-term outcomes vary\nwidely and identifying individuals with poor or advantageous future outcomes would help to optimize treatment\nplanning and resource allocation. Furthermore, antipsychotics are associated with adverse side effects, such as\nincreased risk of diabetes. In this application, we propose to use machine learning approaches to build predictors\nand identify subtypes of clinical outcomes among individuals with schizophrenia, through integration of\nlongitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), dimensional phenotyping, and genetic analyses. We will also\nexplore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. Our long-term objective is to\nadvance the goals of Precision Psychiatry to achieve individualized treatment planning, outcome monitoring, and\npreventive interventions. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Leverage two independent EHR\ndatabases for outcome prediction and sub-classification of psychosis-related disorders. (a) We will use\nthe longitudinal PSYCKES and MarketScan databases to build machine learning-based individual-level\nprediction models to forecast the onset of four major prognostic outcomes: treatment response (antipsychotic\nresistance), illness severity (long-term hospitalization), medical comorbidity (diabetes), and diagnostic transition\nfrom a psychosis-related disorder to schizophrenia. (b) We will perform cohort-level analyses using unsupervised\nmethods to discover novel psychosis-related diagnosis and prognosis subtypes. Aim 2: Enhance predictive\nmodeling through dimensional phenotyping and whole genome sequencing. (a) We will recruit n = 10,000\npatients with schizophrenia from the PSYCKES database population for enriched data collection: 1) dimensional\nphenotyping (cognition, exposome, and social determinants of health), and 2) whole genome sequencing to\nenable calling of rare variants, structural variants, and common variants (polygenic risk). (b) We will investigate\nthe extent to which dimensional phenotypes and genomic data can improve the models developed in Aim 1. Aim\n3: Explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. (a) We will survey\na subset of patients and their clinicians regarding their attitudes towards implementation of clinical outcome\npredictors. (b) We will return pathogenic findings to patients through genetic counseling and survey the\nexperience of patients and their clinicians on their emotional reactions and perceptions of impairment, treatability,\nand life-planning.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe onset of a first episode of psychosis (FEP) in late adolescence or early adulthood often leads to lifelong\ndisability. Timing and precision of treatment are of the essence during this critical developmental period.\nUnfortunately, FEP patients who do not respond to a conventional first-line antipsychotic (FL-AP) are often\ndelayed in transitioning to clozapine (CLZ) - or never switch at all - despite the clear superiority of CLZ to FL-\nAPs in treatment resistant individuals. However, CLZ treatment involves risks of severe side effects, including\nagranulocytosis and weight gain. Currently, clinicians and patients currently have no objective, clinically validated\ntools to guide this complex decision making in FEP. Our collaborative group has recently published work showing\nthat a functional brain scan can help predict which FEP patients might not respond to FL-APs, such as\naripiprazole and risperidone. Further, we have shown that a simple genetics test can help predict who is less\nlikely to gain significant weight, and, similarly, who is less likely to develop agranulocytosis.\nWe propose to conduct a multi-center, harmonized, randomized clinical trial with the goal of testing whether the\nuse of biomarkers can lead to better outcomes for FEP patients. The goal of the proposed study is to develop a\nclozapine decision support tool based on these biomarkers. First, we will characterize 410 people with an FEP\nusing three specific biomarkers: a resting state fMRI scan from which we will derive the striatial connectivity\nindex (SCI) and two genetics tests (one for weight gain and the other for agranulocytosis). Those patients who\nare predicted to not respond to FL-APs, and who also have low risk of weight gain and agranulocytosis\n(approximate n=180), will be randomized in a triple-blind controlled study to either clozapine or an FL-AP (either\naripiprazole or risperidone) for 12 weeks of treatment. Our main outcomes relate to clinical response, including\npositive symptoms, suicidal thinking, and days of hospitalization. We will also perform an MRI at study end to\ndetermine whether functional patterns in the brain distinguish CLZ responders from non-responders (target\nengagement). Critically, we are partnering with people with lived experience of psychosis and family members\nto help guide us during this trial, and to inform the study design and outcomes; information and choice are\namongst the strongest elements of a successful therapeutic relationship. Overall, our study will evaluate the\nefficacy of whether using three biomarkers at the beginning of a first psychotic episode can lead to better patient\noutcomes for patients at risk for poor response, by rapidly introducing CLZ rather than waiting for multiple failures\nof FL-APs.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nPrevention of schizophrenia has primarily focused on adolescents and young adults who are considered to be\nat clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. These youngsters display subtle clinical symptoms that are similar to\npsychosis but not as intense, and therefore considered to still be amenable to early intervention. Initial\nprevention efforts used anti-psychotics as the primary preventive agents but these were shown to be largely\nineffective. More recent approaches have focused on the remediation of the cognitive deficits that are readily\napparent and predictive of future illness in CHR adolescents. However, while cognitive remediation has shown\nsubstantial promise for improving cognitive deficits and improving outcomes in patients with schizophrenia, it\nhas not yet been markedly successful with CHR youth. The proposed study will test an innovative internet-\nbased remotely-delivered Specific COgnitive REmediation plus Surround (or SCORES) intervention for CHR\nadolescents ages 14-20 years old that targets early processing speed deficits as measured at the\nneuropsychological level with the processing speed domain from the NIMH-Measurement and Treatment\nResearch to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) consensus cognitive battery. The proposed\nSCORES treatment package is grounded in a theoretical framework, supported by findings from our group and\nothers, where processing speed deficits contribute to poor social functioning, which in turn leads to an\nincreased risk for psychosis. We specifically selected cognitive remediation because it directly targets a core\ncognitive mechanism, processing speed, which is a rate limiting factor to higher order behaviors and clinical\noutcome in CHR adolescents. To overcome past difficulties in applying a cognitive remediation treatment to\nCHR teenagers, we have developed a platform to support our targeted processing speed training, which\ninvolves reducing the heterogeneity of the CHR study population (including a reduced age range, narrowed\nclinical criteria, and targeting individuals with pre-existing processing deficits). In addition, we have adding a\nnovel support surround component which is expected to increase enjoyment and promote retention. In the\nsingle-arm R61 phase, a 2-year proof of concept study, 30 CHR individuals will receive SCORES for 10\nweeks(4hrs per wk/40 hrs total) with a midpoint assessment at 20 hours (5 weeks) to demonstrate target\nengagement and identify the optimal dose of SCORES needed to engage the target. In the R33 phase, a 3\nyear pilot study, we will replicate target engagement in a new and larger sample of 54 CHR individuals\nrandomized to SCORES (optimized dose)or to a Video GameControl condition to firmly establish the centrality\nof processing speed. In addition, the R33 phase will determine if changes in target engagement are associated\nwith improved social functioning and decreasing attenuated positive symptoms.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "YOUNG ADULTS WITH VIOLENT BEHAVIOR DURING EARLY PSYCHOSIS: A MIXED-METHODS ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION TRIAL",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary: Although the absolute risk of violence among persons with serious mental illnesses (SMI)\nis small, young people experiencing early psychosis are a subgroup at highest violence risk. Violence is a\npublic health issue that contributes to health disparities experienced by adults with schizophrenia, including\ncaregiver burden, social isolation, and incarceration and subsequent early mortality. Cognitive behavioral\ntherapy (CBT) for psychosis and similar behavioral interventions have had efficacy in reducing impairment and\nimproving functioning among young adults with early psychosis. However, no identified studies have explored\nusing a behavioral intervention to reduce violence among young adults with early psychosis.\n In this application, Dr. Stephanie Rolin proposes a comprehensive path towards becoming an independent\nphysician investigator creating and adapting evidence-based approaches to assess and reduce violence risk.\nSpecifically, this proposal follows the CDC\u2019s Map of Adaptation, a model for adapting evidence-based\ninterventions (EBI), to adapt and evaluate the feasibility of an early intervention services (EIS)-specific CBT-\nbased intervention to reduce violence with proposed targets consistent with the transdiagnostic nature of\nResearch Domain Criteria (RDoC). This research will occur at OnTrackNY, the largest EIS program in the\nUnited States; OnTrackNY has provided evidence-based coordinated specialty care to over 1,800 individuals\nat more than 20 clinics in New York State. First, Dr. Rolin will conduct individual semi-structured interviews with\nEIS clients who have engaged in recent violent behavior (n=20) and clinicians who have worked with EIS\nclients who have engaged in violent behavior (n=10). These interviews will use the Theory of Planned Behavior\nto identify key areas of an existing CBT model called PICASSO (which has shown efficacy in reducing\nviolence) that require adaptation for the EIS setting. Next, Dr. Rolin will adapt the PICASSO model for the EIS\nsetting in an open pilot trial, through an iterative process that utilizes mixed methods assessment. Finally, Dr.\nRolin will evaluate the intervention\u2019s feasibility through a pilot RCT.\n To further her long-term career goal of becoming an independent physician-investigator focused on creating\nand adapting EBI to reduce violence risk, Dr Rolin will pursue training in the following four areas: (1) qualitative\nresearch including mixed methods; (2) psychosocial intervention adaptation; (3) psychotherapy clinical trials;\nand (4) grant writing. The product of this study will be an R01 of a large RCT to test the feasibility of the first\nEBI of CBT to reduce violence in the EIS setting. Overall, this award will ensure Dr. Rolin\u2019s successful\ntransition to an independent physician investigator studying the assessment and prevention of violence among\nadults with SMI.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe onset of a first episode of psychosis (FEP) in late adolescence or early adulthood often leads to lifelong\ndisability. Timing and precision of treatment are of the essence during this critical developmental period.\nUnfortunately, FEP patients who do not respond to a conventional first-line antipsychotic (FL-AP) are often\ndelayed in transitioning to clozapine (CLZ) - or never switch at all - despite the clear superiority of CLZ to FL-\nAPs in treatment resistant individuals. However, CLZ treatment involves risks of severe side effects, including\nagranulocytosis and weight gain. Currently, clinicians and patients currently have no objective, clinically validated\ntools to guide this complex decision making in FEP. Our collaborative group has recently published work showing\nthat a functional brain scan can help predict which FEP patients might not respond to FL-APs, such as\naripiprazole and risperidone. Further, we have shown that a simple genetics test can help predict who is less\nlikely to gain significant weight, and, similarly, who is less likely to develop agranulocytosis.\nWe propose to conduct a multi-center, harmonized, randomized clinical trial with the goal of testing whether the\nuse of biomarkers can lead to better outcomes for FEP patients. The goal of the proposed study is to develop a\nclozapine decision support tool based on these biomarkers. First, we will characterize 410 people with an FEP\nusing three specific biomarkers: a resting state fMRI scan from which we will derive the striatial connectivity\nindex (SCI) and two genetics tests (one for weight gain and the other for agranulocytosis). Those patients who\nare predicted to not respond to FL-APs, and who also have low risk of weight gain and agranulocytosis\n(approximate n=180), will be randomized in a triple-blind controlled study to either clozapine or an FL-AP (either\naripiprazole or risperidone) for 12 weeks of treatment. Our main outcomes relate to clinical response, including\npositive symptoms, suicidal thinking, and days of hospitalization. We will also perform an MRI at study end to\ndetermine whether functional patterns in the brain distinguish CLZ responders from non-responders (target\nengagement). Critically, we are partnering with people with lived experience of psychosis and family members\nto help guide us during this trial, and to inform the study design and outcomes; information and choice are\namongst the strongest elements of a successful therapeutic relationship. Overall, our study will evaluate the\nefficacy of whether using three biomarkers at the beginning of a first psychotic episode can lead to better patient\noutcomes for patients at risk for poor response, by rapidly introducing CLZ rather than waiting for multiple failures\nof FL-APs. Our key deliverable would be a clozapine decision support tool, consisting of the three biomarkers\ncombined with our CLZ dosing strategy for FEP. Such a tool would be a necessary step in the development of\nprecision psychiatry; if this efficacy trial is successful, a future study would then utilize implementation science\nto optimize strategies for dissemination of the decision support tool.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nRecent research in the study of brain functions is highlighting the important role of glial cells in\nseveral human neurological and psychiatric disorders. The dopaminergic control of brain\nfunctions is classically assigned to the effect of dopamine on neurons. However, D2R\nexpression has also been reported in astrocytes, questioning what their contribution in the\ndopamine-dependent control of brain functions is.\nBased on preliminary evidence showing an increase of astrocytes and microglia in the PFC of\nmice with an altered control over dopamine synthesis and release, we hypothesize that D2R\nsignaling in astrocytes influences the activity of neighboring cells and induces microglia\nproliferation. This mechanism could play a role in the control of PFC dependent behavior, gene\nexpression in astrocytes and microglia, as well as on the metabolites that they produce.\nThus, we propose to perform experiments to determine the impact of D2R signaling in astrocyte\non PFC functions. We will use viral vectors to knockdown D2R specifically in astrocytes in mice\nwith either a normal control of dopamine synthesis and release or in mutants where these\nfunctions have been altered. This project is timely due to the increased involvement of glia in\nbrain disorders and promises to elucidate mechanisms previously unexplored.",

Further, we have shown that a simple genetics test can help predict who is less\nlikely to gain significant weight, and, similarly, who is less likely to develop agranulocytosis.\nWe propose to conduct a multi-center, harmonized, randomized clinical trial with the goal of testing whether the\nuse of biomarkers can lead to better outcomes for FEP patients. The goal of the proposed study is to develop a\nclozapine decision support tool based on these biomarkers. First, we will characterize 410 people with an FEP\nusing three specific biomarkers: a resting state fMRI scan from which we will derive the striatial connectivity\nindex (SCI) and two genetics tests (one for weight gain and the other for agranulocytosis). Those patients who\nare predicted to not respond to FL-APs, and who also have low risk of weight gain and agranulocytosis\n(approximate n=180), will be randomized in a triple-blind controlled study to either clozapine or an FL-AP (either\naripiprazole or risperidone) for 12 weeks of treatment. Our main outcomes relate to clinical response, including\npositive symptoms, suicidal thinking, and days of hospitalization. We will also perform an MRI at study end to\ndetermine whether functional patterns in the brain distinguish CLZ responders from non-responders (target\nengagement). Critically, we are partnering with people with lived experience of psychosis and family members\nto help guide us during this trial, and to inform the study design and outcomes; information and choice are\namongst the strongest elements of a successful therapeutic relationship. Overall, our study will evaluate the\nefficacy of whether using three biomarkers at the beginning of a first psychotic episode can lead to better patient\noutcomes for patients at risk for poor response, by rapidly introducing CLZ rather than waiting for multiple failures\nof FL-APs. Our key deliverable would be a clozapine decision support tool, consisting of the three biomarkers\ncombined with our CLZ dosing strategy for FEP. Such a tool would be a necessary step in the development of\nprecision psychiatry; if this efficacy trial is successful, a future study would then utilize implementation science\nto optimize strategies for dissemination of the decision support tool.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nNeural circuits are comprised of a rich network of neurons and associated glia that communicate through\nchemical signals. These signals are essential for proper development of neural circuits, and removal of these\nsignals often impairs synapse development, circuit wiring, and circuit function. During development, animal\nexperience drives activity-dependent remodeling of neural circuit structure and function during brief windows\ncalled critical periods. Critical periods are thought to set the ground state for neural circuit wiring, ensuring proper\ncircuit connectivity and synaptic stability, though this hypothesis remains to be tested.\n Recent work indicates that astrocyte-derived signals regulate critical period closure across diverse\ncircuits and animal models. In Drosophila, the motor circuit exhibits a critical period of activity-dependent\nstructural remodeling at the embryo/larval transition. Astrocytes first associate with motor dendrites during peak\nmotor plasticity, and ablating astrocytes is sufficient to extend the critical period. Genetic screening revealed that\nastrocyte-driven critical period closure is dependent on the expression of several cell surface molecules,\nincluding Neuroligin 2 (Nlg2) and Dally/GPC5. Astrocyte-specific knockdown of these signaling molecules\nextended critical period plasticity, whereas astrocyte-specific overexpression drove precocious critical period\nclosure. To understand the mechanisms that establish and maintain neural circuits to drive animal behavior, it is\nimportant to examine the long-term consequences of altered critical period timing on circuit structure and\nfunction. I hypothesize that altering the timing of critical periods will induce long-term changes in motor\ncircuit structure and function to produce distinct motor behaviors. I will use the complementary binary\nexpression systems, Gal4/UAS or LexA/LexAop, to manipulate the expression of astrocyte-derived nlg2 and\ndally to extend (Aim 1) or precociously close (Aim 2) the motor critical period while I simultaneously assess motor\ncircuit structure and function. Specifically, I will evaluate long-term changes to circuit connectivity, synaptic\nstability, motor output, and locomotor behavior by assessing these features at successively later stages spanning\ncircuit development to the mature circuit. The completion of these experiments will provide insights into how\naltered critical period timing affects circuit development at the synaptic and cellular levels, and will directly link\nthese changes to motor behavior. Thus, my goals meet priority area #4 of the BRAIN Initiative, \u201cDemonstrating\ncausality: Link brain activity to behavior with precise interventional tools that change neural circuit dynamics.\u201d\n The role of astrocytes in closing critical periods has only recently been uncovered. This discovery opens\na new intervention point for investigating the development and long-term maintenance of neural circuits. As this\nrole of astrocytes is conserved from fly through mouse, I anticipate that the results of this project will be broadly\napplicable across distinct systems and circuits.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nClinical predictors are now firmly incorporated into routine standard-of-care in many fields of medicine, in contrast\nwith Psychiatry where quantitative predictors that guide clinical decision-making remain extremely\nlimited. Psychosis-related disorders are responsible for a substantial public health burden, for which there are\nsignificant unmet needs that would be subserved by clinical predictors. For example, long-term outcomes vary\nwidely and identifying individuals with poor or advantageous future outcomes would help to optimize treatment\nplanning and resource allocation. Furthermore, antipsychotics are associated with adverse side effects, such as\nincreased risk of diabetes. In this application, we propose to use machine learning approaches to build predictors\nand identify subtypes of clinical outcomes among individuals with schizophrenia, through integration of\nlongitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), dimensional phenotyping, and genetic analyses. We will also\nexplore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. Our long-term objective is to\nadvance the goals of Precision Psychiatry to achieve individualized treatment planning, outcome monitoring, and\npreventive interventions. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Leverage two independent EHR\ndatabases for outcome prediction and sub-classification of psychosis-related disorders. (a) We will use\nthe longitudinal PSYCKES and MarketScan databases to build machine learning-based individual-level\nprediction models to forecast the onset of four major prognostic outcomes: treatment response (antipsychotic\nresistance), illness severity (long-term hospitalization), medical comorbidity (diabetes), and diagnostic transition\nfrom a psychosis-related disorder to schizophrenia. (b) We will perform cohort-level analyses using unsupervised\nmethods to discover novel psychosis-related diagnosis and prognosis subtypes. Aim 2: Enhance predictive\nmodeling through dimensional phenotyping and whole genome sequencing. (a) We will recruit n = 10,000\npatients with schizophrenia from the PSYCKES database population for enriched data collection: 1) dimensional\nphenotyping (cognition, exposome, and social determinants of health), and 2) whole genome sequencing to\nenable calling of rare variants, structural variants, and common variants (polygenic risk). (b) We will investigate\nthe extent to which dimensional phenotypes and genomic data can improve the models developed in Aim 1. Aim\n3: Explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. (a) We will survey\na subset of patients and their clinicians regarding their attitudes towards implementation of clinical outcome\npredictors.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "ABSTRACT\n The mechanisms underlying how rewards are learned, and how they translate into behavior have been\na subject of interest to researchers and scientists since Pavlov\u2019s classical conditioning experiments in the\n1890s. Recently, Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA) neurons in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) have\nemerged as key modulators of reward learning, and potential therapeutic targets for addressing addiction,\ndepression, and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Previous studies have shown that GABA neurons in the VTA\nundergo a form of experience-dependent plasticity that involves the downregulation of the anion transporter,\nKCC2. This reduction of KCC2 levels has been found to increase the excitability of GABA neurons by\ndecreasing the efficacy of GABAA receptor function. In the context of drugs of abuse and aversive stimuli, this\nmechanism has been studied in great detail. However, the impact of this mechanism on specific reward-related\npathways and its contribution to naturalistic reward learning remains unknown.\n In my thesis work thus far, I have examined whether modifications in KCC2 serve as an innate\nmechanism during reward learning that allows the brain to establish enduring associations between\ncontextual cues and appetitive stimuli. I first characterized the expression of KCC2 throughout the course of\ncue-reward associative learning and showed that KCC2 downregulation shifts VTA GABA neurons towards\nexcitability at critical time points during reward learning. My data also demonstrate that KCC2-mediated\nplasticity drives increased synchronized activity between VTA GABA neurons ex vivo. Subsequently, I\ndemonstrate that VTA GABA neurons exhibit enhanced synchronization in vivo, and it is concurrent with the\nsame time points when KCC2 downregulation occurs.\n This F99/K00 proposal comprises two aims outlined in the following research plan. In Aim 1, I will\nexamine whether this form of plasticity occurs in vivo, and consequently leads to enhanced synchronized\nnetwork activity. To achieve this, I will combine multi-unit silicon recordings with pharmacological and genetic\napproaches to manipulate levels of KCC2 and examine neural network dynamics during reward learning. Aim 2\ndelineates my aspirations to identify and obtain a postdoctoral position. During the K00 phase, I plan to\ninvestigate the molecular, cellular, and neurocircuit-specific mechanisms shaping susceptibility or\nresilience to common neuropsychiatric disorders. To this end, my sponsors and I have crafted a thorough\nplan for my F99 (predoctoral) and K00 (postdoctoral) phases. The F99/K00 will support my goals for becoming\nan independent researcher by facilitating the successful completion of my PhD and bolstering a seamless\ntransition into a strong postdoctoral position.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nClinical predictors are now firmly incorporated into routine standard-of-care in many fields of medicine, in contrast\nwith Psychiatry where quantitative predictors that guide clinical decision-making remain extremely\nlimited. Psychosis-related disorders are responsible for a substantial public health burden, for which there are\nsignificant unmet needs that would be subserved by clinical predictors. For example, long-term outcomes vary\nwidely and identifying individuals with poor or advantageous future outcomes would help to optimize treatment\nplanning and resource allocation. Furthermore, antipsychotics are associated with adverse side effects, such as\nincreased risk of diabetes. In this application, we propose to use machine learning approaches to build predictors\nand identify subtypes of clinical outcomes among individuals with schizophrenia, through integration of\nlongitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), dimensional phenotyping, and genetic analyses. We will also\nexplore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. Our long-term objective is to\nadvance the goals of Precision Psychiatry to achieve individualized treatment planning, outcome monitoring, and\npreventive interventions. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Leverage two independent EHR\ndatabases for outcome prediction and sub-classification of psychosis-related disorders. (a) We will use\nthe longitudinal PSYCKES and MarketScan databases to build machine learning-based individual-level\nprediction models to forecast the onset of four major prognostic outcomes: treatment response (antipsychotic\nresistance), illness severity (long-term hospitalization), medical comorbidity (diabetes), and diagnostic transition\nfrom a psychosis-related disorder to schizophrenia. (b) We will perform cohort-level analyses using unsupervised\nmethods to discover novel psychosis-related diagnosis and prognosis subtypes. Aim 2: Enhance predictive\nmodeling through dimensional phenotyping and whole genome sequencing. (a) We will recruit n = 10,000\npatients with schizophrenia from the PSYCKES database population for enriched data collection: 1) dimensional\nphenotyping (cognition, exposome, and social determinants of health), and 2) whole genome sequencing to\nenable calling of rare variants, structural variants, and common variants (polygenic risk). (b) We will investigate\nthe extent to which dimensional phenotypes and genomic data can improve the models developed in Aim 1. Aim\n3: Explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. (a) We will survey\na subset of patients and their clinicians regarding their attitudes towards implementation of clinical outcome\npredictors. (b) We will return pathogenic findings to patients through genetic counseling and survey the\nexperience of patients and their clinicians on their emotional reactions and perceptions of impairment, treatability,\nand life-planning.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Digital therapeutics are transforming healthcare. Digital therapeutics are clinical-grade software used\nto prevent, treat, or manage a medical disorder or disease. A large body of research demonstrates that digital\ntherapeutics can have a major impact on health costs, health behavior, and health outcomes. For example, in\nour work, digital therapeutics for substance use disorders (SUDs) more than double drug abstinence rates\ncompared to standard addiction treatment systems in the U.S. and greatly increase retention in SUD treatment.\nThey also have synergistic effects with medication treatments for SUDs. And, they are associated with marked\nreductions in ED visits, inpatient utilization, and net costs, and increases in medication adherence.\nDespite their impressive clinical value, several challenges persist in fully realizing the potential of digital\ntherapeutics to improve people\u2019s lives across the globe. First, the pace at which digital therapeutics are\ndeveloped, tested and commercialized is slow. Second, many development activities are redundant across\nprojects. Third, due to budget, time and capacity constraints, many scientists develop prototypes of digital\ntherapeutics that can be used in research trials but which are not built to scale for use by large numbers of end\nusers. Finally, most digital therapeutics cannot be readily adapted for use by various target populations critical\nfor advancing digital health equity (e.g., adapted to culture, language, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation).\n Based on over two decades of NIH-supported work developing, evaluating and commercializing digital\ntherapeutics, we have developed a unique digital therapeutics platform (Laddr) which integrates science-\nbased, therapeutic processes to address a wide range of behavioral problems within a single digital platform.\nThis platform offers the potential to revolutionize digital health - as it provides a scalable model for delivering\ndigital therapeutics to treat any disorder with a behavioral component. We now plan to make an editable\nversion of Laddr (which we call Cogito) commercially available to developers of digital therapeutics. Cogito will\nprovide a turnkey solution for rapidly developing, evaluating, deploying, and scaling digital therapeutics for the\nprevention, treatment and/or management of any disease or disorder - via a drag and drop interface with no\nprogramming necessary.\n In this Phase 1 SBIR application, we will finalize several features of the Cogito platform to increase its\ncommercial potential as a turnkey platform for developing and hosting digital therapeutics. And we will assess\nthe feasibility, technical merit, and commercial potential of the Cogito digital therapeutics platform via usability\ntesting with clinical researchers. We will focus on the usability of Cogito with researchers in the field of SUD\ntreatment in this initial phase and then expand to a broad clinical research community focused on the\nprevention, treatment, or management of various health conditions in future iterations of this work. Overall,\nCogito offers great promise to markedly accelerate the pace and impact of science based digital therapeutics.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Summary/Abstract\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have associated hundreds of thousands of genetic variants with\nhuman disease and complex traits. 90% of associated variants reside in noncoding sequences that can\nenhance or suppress gene expression levels. While GWAS does not reveal the target genes of associated\nvariants, extraordinary effort has been dedicated to mapping target genes that carry out the functional effects\nof noncoding genetic variation. While knowing which genetic variants cause disease is not often sufficient for\nclinical intervention, identifying disease genes can efficiently accelerate the development of therapeutics.\nCorrelations between genotype and gene expression, known as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)\nstudies, can provide valuable insight into the mechanism of disease-associated variants. For example, a\nprevious study found MAPK3 to be associated with schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental phenotypes via a\nkey role in neuronal proliferation. Thousands of genetic associations are still uncharacterized in terms of their\ntarget genes and cell types of action. This proposal will develop new algorithms to robustly map disease-\nassociated variants to disease-critical genes and infer their cell-type-specific regulatory behavior across three\naims. First, we hypothesize that new disease-critical genes will be discovered if variants are accurately\nmapped to target genes in non-Europeans, where cohorts are small and variant-to-gene mapping is imprecise.\nTo this end, we will develop a novel gene-disease mapping technique for understudied populations. Second,\nwe hypothesize that linking distal regulatory variants to target genes should provide mechanistic explanations\nfor many uncharacterized GWAS variants. To this end, we will develop a high-dimensional feature selection\ntechnique to detect distal effects on gene expression. Third, we hypothesize that novel variant-to-gene links\ncan be identified by analyzing rare cell types from single cell RNA-sequencing. To this end, we will link variants\nto genes in cell-type-specific contexts using mixed models for heritability estimation. Overall, while gene\nexpression prediction models are a powerful tool to link genes to disease, they have been applied to only\nlimited study designs: single ancestry gene expression cohorts (which are not powerful in non-European\npopulations with limited sample sizes), predictor variants in the cis regulatory window, and bulk tissue or cell\ntype gene expression data. There are many open questions due to these limitations that our proposal aims to\naddress including the degree to which genetic variation regulates gene expression in population-specific\nmanners, via long-range mechanisms, in cell-type-specific or cell-state-specific manners, and in ways that are\nrelevant to complex traits and diseases. Our contribution is expected to be significant because still 30% of\ndisease-associated variants have no known target gene and because this work will diversify genetic discovery\nto populations who are most at risk.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nClinical predictors are now firmly incorporated into routine standard-of-care in many fields of medicine, in contrast\nwith Psychiatry where quantitative predictors that guide clinical decision-making remain extremely\nlimited. Psychosis-related disorders are responsible for a substantial public health burden, for which there are\nsignificant unmet needs that would be subserved by clinical predictors. For example, long-term outcomes vary\nwidely and identifying individuals with poor or advantageous future outcomes would help to optimize treatment\nplanning and resource allocation. Furthermore, antipsychotics are associated with adverse side effects, such as\nincreased risk of diabetes. In this application, we propose to use machine learning approaches to build predictors\nand identify subtypes of clinical outcomes among individuals with schizophrenia, through integration of\nlongitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), dimensional phenotyping, and genetic analyses. We will also\nexplore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. Our long-term objective is to\nadvance the goals of Precision Psychiatry to achieve individualized treatment planning, outcome monitoring, and\npreventive interventions. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Leverage two independent EHR\ndatabases for outcome prediction and sub-classification of psychosis-related disorders. (a) We will use\nthe longitudinal PSYCKES and MarketScan databases to build machine learning-based individual-level\nprediction models to forecast the onset of four major prognostic outcomes: treatment response (antipsychotic\nresistance), illness severity (long-term hospitalization), medical comorbidity (diabetes), and diagnostic transition\nfrom a psychosis-related disorder to schizophrenia. (b) We will perform cohort-level analyses using unsupervised\nmethods to discover novel psychosis-related diagnosis and prognosis subtypes. Aim 2: Enhance predictive\nmodeling through dimensional phenotyping and whole genome sequencing. (a) We will recruit n = 10,000\npatients with schizophrenia from the PSYCKES database population for enriched data collection: 1) dimensional\nphenotyping (cognition, exposome, and social determinants of health), and 2) whole genome sequencing to\nenable calling of rare variants, structural variants, and common variants (polygenic risk). (b) We will investigate\nthe extent to which dimensional phenotypes and genomic data can improve the models developed in Aim 1. Aim\n3: Explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. (a) We will survey\na subset of patients and their clinicians regarding their attitudes towards implementation of clinical outcome\npredictors. (b) We will return pathogenic findings to patients through genetic counseling and survey the\nexperience of patients and their clinicians on their emotional reactions and perceptions of impairment, treatability,\nand life-planning.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nPeople with schizophrenia have a broad range of cognitive impairments, which are major determinants of the\npoor functional outcome observed in people with this disorder. Unfortunately, pharmacological and non-\npharmacological interventions have limited benefits for these impairments. In the absence of effective\ntreatments, cognitive impairments remain a critical unmet therapeutic need, and the development of novel\napproaches for their treatment remains a central therapeutic challenge. Over the past 10 years, considerable\nevidence has emerged to suggest that the gut microbiota has significant effects on brain development and\nbehavior, in part, through the regulation of immune system function. The gut microbiota affects immune system\nfunction through the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other mechanisms. There are three\nmajor SCFAs: butyrate, propionate, and acetate, of which, butyrate appears to have the most pronounced\neffects on the immune system. Prebiotics are dietary fibers that promote the growth or activity of gut\nmicroorganisms, which leads to enhanced well-being of the host; they have been shown to increase the activity\nof multiple different bacteria species, including butyrate-producing bacteria. In light of the emerging evidence\nthat suggests schizophrenia is characterized by multiple abnormalities of the immune system, which lead to a\npro-inflammatory state, the proposed R61 and R33 projects are designed to evaluate the hypothesis that\nprebiotic administration will lead to increased production of butyrate, through increased activity of butyrate-\nproducing bacteria in the gut microbiota; the increase in serum butyrate levels will be associated with changes\nin cognitive function, symptoms, and metabolic measures. In the R61 project, we will conduct a 10-day,\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (RCT) to determine if the prebiotic: Prebiotin\n(12g/day), an oligofructose-enriched inulin (FOS), alters the hypothesized biological signature, i.e., increases\nserum butyrate levels. We will use an inulin-challenge paradigm to asses the effect of FOS on serum butyrate\nlevels. In the R33 project, we will conduct a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, RCT, to confirm the\nability of the prebiotic: FOS (12g/day), to alter the hypothesized biological signature: serum butyrate levels. We\nwill also examine the extent to which changes in serum butyrate levels are associated with changes in\ncognitive function, symptoms, and metabolic measures. We will use the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive\nBattery to assess change in cognitive function. The study will provide critical preliminary data on the clinical\nutility of prebiotic treatment for the improvement of cognitive function in people with schizophrenia.",

The requested equipment will improve NKI\u2019s animal housing by\nestablishing an ability for 24-hour remote monitoring of the cage microenvironment, promoting health, less\ndisturbance of cage inhabitants, and normal baseline behavior and physiology, conditions necessary to\nproduce more accurate animal models in brain-and-behavior studies. Such models, which, at NKI, aim at\nunderstanding the molecular basis of normal and diseased states, also have improved translational usefulness,\nincluding the development of early diagnostic and treatment abilities. Long-term monitoring of the behavior\nand activity of mice in their natural environment using non-intrusive methods in their home cages can better\nreveal their behavior and activity in their natural environment. Using home cage monitoring devices to track\nthe activity levels of mice, researchers can evaluate phenotypic expression of inserted or deleted genes as well\nas the effectiveness of interventions, such as exercise and pharmaceutical treatments, on activity levels and all\nwhile improving overall general health and husbandry. The DVC systems, as a shared resource, will be used to\nprovide GEM (genetically modified mice) models for multiple studies supported by funding from the NIH,\nAlzheimer\u2019s Association, Jerome LeJeune Foundation, New Vision Research, the Dr. Ralph and Marian Falk\nMedical Research Trust, and the Templeton World Charity Foundation.

The proposed study is to use a novel approach to design rTMS treatment for auditory\nhallucination that is based on a strong neural circuitry mechanism on auditory hallucination formation. The\nproject will recruit patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and randomize patients into active rTMS\nversus sham rTMS groups followed by four fMRI based target engagement outcome assessments at baseline\nand after 10, and 20 visits of daily rTMS plus a 2 week maintenance phase. The proposal will use new\nstimulation site and stimulation mode combinations that are different from previous rTMS trials on auditory\nhallucination, but are conceptualized to be more closely linked to neural circuitry mechanisms of auditory\nhalluciantion formation. The proposal will include two phases as two separate projects. The first proposed\nproject is a R61 for two years. If the Go/Nogo milestones are not met, the study will end. If all Go/Nogo\nmilestones are met, it will proceed to a R33 project for three more years.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\n Comparative effectiveness research (CER) in medicine is commonly conducted to discover and provide infor-\nmation on possible differences between alternative drugs or treatments in their effectiveness and safety. Such\ninformation, if reliable and accurate, can help patients, clinicians, and other healthcare stakeholders to make\nbetter-informed healthcare decisions and improve healthcare delivery and outcomes. However, drawing valid\nand relevant inferences about treatment effects from observational studies involves effort and expertise from\nboth subject-matter researchers and statisticians. On one hand, causal inference relies on structural assump-\ntions. Two prominent classes of such assumptions are unconfoundedness or instrument variable (IV) assump-\ntions. On the other hand, granted the structural assumptions, causal inference also requires statistical modeling\nand estimation of population properties and associations from empirical data. The problem of statistical learning\nand inference can be challenging, while allowing a large number of candidate regressors such as main effects\nand interactions of covariates. The objective of our research is to develop, evaluate, and disseminate a new\nset of theoretically rigorous, numerically automated, and practically useful methods of statistical learning and\ninference for estimating treatment effects in CER with complex, high-dimensional data. Three specific aims\nare (1) high-dimensional inference about population and subpopulation average treatment effects under uncon-\nfoundedness with multi-valued treatments, (2) high-dimensional inference about local average treatment effects\nand IV-dependent average treatment effects on the treated with multi-valued instruments and treatments, and\n(3) high-dimensional inference about average treatment effects such as contrasts between survival and hazard\nprobabilities with longitudinal and survival data. We will investigate applications of the new methods to several\ncomparative effectiveness and safety studies including a recent study on comparative treatment strategies in\nschizophrenia and an ongoing project to evaluate the therapeutic exchangeability of same-class drugs, for ex-\nample, direct oral anticoagulants among patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter or dipeptidyl peptidase-4\ninhibitors among patients with type 2 diabetes, while exploiting IVs created by the design of the Medicare pre-\nscription drug benefit.

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Abstract\nMillions of Americans suffer from deficits in reward processing, in the context of psychiatric disorders including\nmajor depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Disrupted reward processing leads to worse outcomes, yet\ncurrent treatments poorly treat this symptom and new treatments are urgently needed. Recent evidence that\nmu opioid antagonists function as antidepressants suggest the opioid system as a promising line for\ndeveloping novel treatments. We hypothesize that increasing endogenous enkephalins by using molecules\n(DENKIs) that inhibit the degradation of this endogenous class of opioid peptides will reverse reward seeking\ndeficits without raising the liability for substance use disorders. To test this hypothesis and extend our\npreliminary data, we will administer a DENKI to chronically stressed mice and record in vivo neural activity in\nthe reward circuitry (ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc)) as the freely moving mice\nengage in a reward task that assesses different aspects of reward processing. Using KO mice and receptor-\nspecific antagonists, in Aim 1, we will determine if these effects are mediated by MOR and in Aim 2, test\nwhether they are mediated by delta opioid receptor (DOR). We will also confirm that DENKI administration is\nnot inherently rewarding. Successful completion of these aims will yield novel insights into how the opioid\nsystem influence reward circuity activity during behavior and establish the basis for more detailed study of\nendogenous enkephalin modulators as treatments for the anhedonia commonly seen in psychiatric disorders.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nIndividuals with schizophrenia (SZ) use cannabis at a high rate, which exacerbates SZ symptoms and worsens\nlong-term prognosis. Recent studies suggest that while individuals with genetic risks for SZ are more likely to\nuse cannabis, cannabis users are also at a dually (i.e., genetically and pharmacologically) increased risk for the\nexpression of SZ related symptoms. The psychoactive substance in cannabis, \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),\ntargets the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R) in the brain. I recently showed\nthat CB1R is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory axon terminals in the human dorsolateral prefrontal\ncortex (DLPFC) \u2013 a region implicated in working memory impairments of SZ. Then, I found increased CB1R in\nexcitatory terminals, and decreased CB1R in inhibitory terminals, in the DLPFC of SZ subjects without comorbid\ncannabis use. Conversely, in a pilot analysis of THC-exposed rats, I saw decreased CB1R in inhibitory terminals\nin the prelimbic cortex (PrL) \u2013 a functional homolog of the DLPFC \u2013 but no changes in excitatory terminals. I now\npropose to expand on these results to characterize the independent and additive effects of SZ and cannabis use\non terminal type-specific CB1R expression and signaling, and resulting functional alterations. I hypothesize that\nindividuals with SZ have terminal type-specific CB1R aberrations that contribute to impaired working memory.\nTHC exposure then intensifies these terminal type-specific CB1R changes, further worsening working memory.\nI will test this hypothesis using the synergistic strengths of cross-species analyses, through a set of postmortem\nand rat experimental Aims, to clarify the effects of findings observed in human samples with preclinical studies.\nMulti-label immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy will be used to define the terminal type-specific CB1R\nalterations in the DLPFC of SZ individuals with and without comorbid cannabis use (Aim 1). Viral manipulations\nand intravenous rat THC self-administration, followed by working memory tests, will be used to delineate how\nterminal type-specific CB1R changes and THC exposure alter working memory (Aim 2). Proximity labeling and\ntargeted mass spectrometry will be used to compare terminal type-specific CB1R phosphopeptide alterations in\nthe DLPFC of SZ individuals with and without comorbid cannabis use, and the PrL of rats with and without THC\nexposure (Aim 3). Integrated with the scientific Aims is training to 1) Develop expertise in translational studies of\nSZ cortical cell and circuit pathology. 2) Acquire expertise in the design and execution of in vivo viral mediated\ngene transfer. 3) Train in the design and execution of THC self-administration. 4) Enhance knowledge of GPCR\nsignaling biology using phosphoproteomics. 5) Learn advanced biostatistics to analyze complex postmortem and\nrodent datasets. Achieving these Aims will identify the independent and additive effects of SZ and cannabis use\non terminal type-specific CB1R expression and signaling in the DLPFC, and the resulting functional alterations.\nThe training and knowledge gained will support future R01 testing strategies to rescue CB1R abnormalities, and\nprovide me with the necessary skills to establish a successful independent, NIH-funded research program.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary_Abstract\n Mental health problems are increasing worldwide; however, the vast majority of people struggling with\nmental health challenges do not receive any treatment and the mental health workforce is woefully insufficient\nto meet our population-level needs. Digital Therapeutics (DTx) are optimally positioned to tackle these\nchallenges and transform mental health care. DTx are clinical-grade software used to prevent, treat, or\nmanage a medical disorder or disease. DTx can have a major impact on health costs, health behavior, and\nhealth outcomes. For example, DTx can effectively treat depression, anxiety, ADHD, panic disorder and eating\ndisorders, among many other mental health conditions. And, they are associated with marked reductions in ED\nvisits, inpatient utilization, and net costs, and increases in medication adherence.\nDespite their impressive clinical value, several challenges persist in fully realizing the potential of DTx\nto improve people\u2019s lives globally. First, the pace at which DTx are developed, tested, and commercialized is\nslow. Second, many development activities are redundant across projects. Third, due to budget, time and\ncapacity constraints, many scientists develop prototypes of DTx that can be used in research but which are not\nbuilt to scale for large numbers of users. Finally, most DTx cannot be readily modified for various populations\ncritical for advancing digital health equity (adapted to culture, language, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation).\n Based on over two decades of NIH-supported work developing, evaluating and commercializing DTx, we\nhave developed a unique DTx platform (Laddr) which integrates science-based, therapeutic processes to\naddress a wide range of behavioral problems within a single digital platform. This platform offers the potential\nto revolutionize digital health - as it provides a scalable model for delivering DTx to treat any disorder with a\nbehavioral component. We now plan to make an editable version of Laddr (called Cogito) commercially\navailable to developers of DTx. Cogito will provide a turnkey solution for rapidly developing, evaluating,\ndeploying, and scaling DTx for the prevention, treatment and/or management of any disease or disorder - via a\ndrag and drop interface with no programming necessary.\n In this Phase 1 SBIR application, we will finalize several features of the Cogito platform to increase its\ncommercial potential as a turnkey platform for developing and hosting DTx. And we will assess the feasibility,\ntechnical merit, and commercial potential of the Cogito DTx platform via usability testing with clinical\nresearchers. We will focus on the usability of Cogito with researchers in the mental health field in this initial\nphase and then expand to a broad clinical research community focused on the prevention, treatment, or\nmanagement of various health conditions in future iterations of this work.\nto markedly accelerate the pace and impact of science based DTx.\nOverall, Cogito offers great promise",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nInhibitory control deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs), with clear\nmanifestations seen in psychophysiological, electrophysiological, and neuroanatomical measures of these\nprocesses. Addressing these symptoms is of critical clinical relevance since they are a main predictor of negative\nvocational and psychosocial outcomes. An intriguing set of findings has suggested physical activity and exercise\ncan have a positive effect on SSD symptomatology, but the exercise-linked neural changes that may result in\nimproved inhibitory control is unknown. Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) technologies enable the assessment\nof cognitive control processes in participants using high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG) during task\nperformance and physical activity. During the F99 phase, using cutting-edge MoBI technologies, I will test if a\nsingle acute walking intervention will mitigate behavioral and neurophysiological indices of inhibitory control\ndeficits in SSDs (Aim 1A) and if individuals with SSDs showing significant improvement in inhibitory control\nperformance and normalization of inhibition-related event-related-potential (ERP) components to neurotypical\nadults have less severe psychosis symptoms (Aim 1B). In Aim 2, I examine the underlying structural-functional\nneural bases and behavior of disturbances in cognitive control and sensory processing among people with and\nat risk for SSDs. Upon completion of both phases, I will become a multimodal neuroimaging and computational\npsychiatry expert in SSDs. Learning neuroimaging methods (fMRI) and computational models to stimulate the\ncomplex dynamics of brain function and behavior, alongside environmental factors, will enable me to identify the\nunderlying mechanisms of SSDs and propel the field forward in developing personalized treatments. The training\nreceived during the F99/K00 phases will prepare me for the transition to a faculty position at a R1 institution,\nwhere I will lead a distinguished neuroscience program and implement diversity initiatives to address issues\nrelated to diversity and inclusion in neuroscience. As an expert in multimodal neuroimaging and computational\npsychiatry, I will persist in exploring similar K00 research, now focusing on individuals who are D/deaf or hard-\nof-hearing (D/HH) with psychosis to investigate variations of sensory-cognitive neural circuits generating auditory\nand visual hallucinations, as well as develop personalized treatment algorithms. I am firmly committed to\nproviding practical, tractable solutions to individuals with SSDs through basic knowledge.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\n Sensitive periods are periods during early windows of development in external experiences or exposures\ncan shape patterns of connectivity and behavior later in life. Such periods allow for circuit maturation to adapt to\nenvironmental factors but also confer risk for psychiatric disorders. Indeed, previous work in our lab has shown\nthat suppressing the activity of prefrontal parvalbumin-expressing (PFC PV) interneurons during postnatal day\n14 to 32 (P14-P32) results in impaired neural connectivity, network function and PFC-dependent cognitive\nflexibility later in life. Cognitive inflexibility and PFC dysfunction are both hallmarks of various psychiatric\nillnesses, whose origins are often rooted in development. Thus, it is pivotal to understand the factors that\ninfluence the activity of developing PFC PV interneurons, leading to alterations in PFC circuit remodeling.\n The neuromodulator serotonin (5-HT) is well positioned to influence the activity of developing PFC PV\ncells. Indeed, the PFC is densely innervated by 5-HT and 5-HT receptors can be detected in the developing\nPFC. Additionally, 5-HT modulates PFC PV activity in adulthood. Moreover, 5-HT release in development,\nwhich can be caused various external and genetic factors, versus adulthood yields opposing effects on adult\ncognition. For instance, increases in 5-HT release into the PFC in adulthood improves cognitive flexibility, and I\nhave demonstrated that potentiating 5-HT release in development (P12-21) impairs adult cognitive flexibility. I\nhypothesize that P14-21 is a sensitive period during which potentiating 5-HT signaling may suppress PV\nexcitability with long-lasting consequences for cognitive behavior.\n My experiments are designed to elucidate mechanisms contributing to the developmental trajectories of\ncomplex cognitive behavior and identify early risk factors of mental illness. In Aim 1, I investigate the direct\neffects of 5-HT on developing PFC PV excitability by employing slice electrophysiology. In Aim 2, I examine\nthe net effects of 5-HT release into the PFC on PV interneuron activity using an in vivo model, optogenetics\nand fiber photometry. With these experiments, I will test the hypothesis that 5-HT release during development\nsuppresses the activity of PFC PV interneurons and shifts into exciting PV in adulthood. In Aim 3, I evaluate\nhow 5-HT potentiation to the PFC alters cognitive flexibility using chemogenetics and cognitive flexibility\nassays. With this experiment, I will test the hypothesis that developmental potentiation 5-HT release into the\nPFC is sufficient and necessary to produce cognitive inflexibility.\n Overall, my goal for this proposal is to better understand how factors that affect 5-HT levels impact PFC\ndevelopment and PFC-dependent cognitive behavior later in life. As PV interneurons are critical for PFC\nmaturation, their interactions with 5-HT may constitute important markers preceding the onset of disease.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Visual attention is our ability to prioritize vision as a sensory modality, and our ability to extract discrete\ninformation from a visual scene. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is considered a source of feedback modulation to\nthe visual cortex\u2013 guiding, biasing or modulating activity in the visual cortex, to produce visual attention. The\nvisual cortex of the mouse receives monosynaptic input from two discrete PFC subregions, the anterior cingulate\ncortex (ACA) and the orbitofrontal cortex (ORB), that contribute to diverse aspects of cognition. However, it is\ncurrently unknown how these distinct PFC subregions contribute to different aspects of visual attention. Equipped\nwith precise understanding of distinct forms of PFC feedback modulation on visual processing, we will be in a\nbetter position to strategically intervene in disorders of visual processing and attention. The proposed work\ntherefore aims to bridge the long-standing hypothesis of PFC feedback modulation with changes in population\nactivity in the visual cortex, how this activity change alters visual processing, and ultimately what effect this has\non goal-directed visual attention. To achieve this goal, I will quantitively and qualitatively compare the activity of\nACA and ORB axons in the visual cortex during different behavioral epochs of visual attention (Aim 1), probing\neach areas contribution to different aspects of vision. In following, perturbating the activity of each discrete PFC\noutput pathway, allows me to observe changes in population activity in the visual cortex, how this activity change\nalters visual processing, and ultimately what effect this has on goal-directed visual attention (Aim 2). Finally, I\nwill target PFC output pathways with a distinct connectivity profile, to understand how these projections modulate\nthe activity of the visual cortex, and if they represent a distinct functional module in regulating sensory processing\n(Aim 3). Understanding how discrete subregions of the PFC influence the activity of the visual cortex, and its\nbehavioral consequences, will provide key insights towards the cellular underpinnings of visual processing in the\nbrain.\nThe proposed work will be conducted at the Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department, MIT, with the direct\nmentorship of Prof. Mriganka Sur (MIT), from which I have already benefitted experimental training in numerous\ntechniques including two-photon microscopy, visual cortex neurophysiology, circuit anatomy, and behavior. In\naddition, I will receive training and guidance on optogenetic tools in combination with two-photon imaging, and\nPFC physiology from Prof. Ofer Yizhar (WI), and computational methods in population activity analysis from Prof.\nMehrdad Jazayeri (MIT).

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary / Abstract\n Cognitive rigidity is the inability to adapt behavior in a context-dependent manner. A\nhallmark of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and\nschizophrenia, cognitive rigidity is a debilitating symptom with limited therapeutic tools available\nfor promoting proper cognitive flexibility1,2. Currently, the field\u2019s understanding of the neural\nmechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility are limited to several implicated brain regions with\nlittle insight into the how the microcircuitry of these areas contributes to context-dependent rule\nswitching. Multiple studies point to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) as a critical hub for\ncognitive flexibility, specifically for its encoding of response and outcome information1,2,3. The\nproposed work aims to parse apart how information is encoded in different neuron types, how\ndisrupting the activity of these neuronal types impacts context-dependent decision making, and\nhow distinct neurotransmitter signaling onto these cells impacts behavioral flexibility. The\noverarching goal is to understand the contributions of multiple cell-types in mPFC to the\nupdating of response and outcome task variables in response to changing reward\ncontingencies. Given the advent of genetic tools to target and manipulate genetically-defined\nneuronal types in mPFC in mice, the goal of this project is to leverage tools such as calcium\nimaging through cortical microprisms, optogenetic silencing of functionally-distinct neuronal\ntypes, and cell-type-specific knockout of key receptors using CRISPR-Cas9 to explore this\nmicrocircuitry.\n I have chosen to pursue this project at UCLA given its vast resources and highly\ncollaborative environment. Furthermore, the Golshani lab is an optimal setting for completing\nthe aims in this proposal due to its long history of using various calcium imaging and\noptogenetic techniques. With existing access to mentors who are capable in these techniques,\nas well as the tools themselves, I will quickly proceed through my proposed training plan and\nbecome a capable systems neuroscientist. With both the support from experienced lab\nmembers as well as the broader UCLA community, I believe that I am well equipped to succeed\nand that the additional training and resources facilitated by this award will help me to fulfill my\ngoal of becoming an independent career scientist with my own lab at an R1 research university.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "The last decade has witnessed a surge in new research findings in neuroscience. So far, however, that\nimpressive progress has not translated into more effective treatments, or better outcomes, for patients with\nserious mental illness. Although this may just be a matter of time, another contributing factor is the lack of\nphysician scientists in the field of clinical neuroscience. Physician scientists are uniquely capable of linking\nbasic science findings to the clinical phenomenology of psychiatric illness. Indeed, scientists like these - with\nboth clinical and research training - are uniquely poised to bridge the gap between basic neurobiology and\nclinical disease. This combination is critical for advancing our understanding of the neurobiology of psychiatric\ndisorders - and for developing the highly needed disease-modifying treatments for psychiatric illnesses.\nOne of the explanations for the lack of clinician-scientists is the difficulty in obtaining grant funding right after\nresidency. This proposal aims to fill that gap. In a two-three year fellowship we will provide intense research\ntraining for a select group of psychiatrists (or PhD psychologists). Upon completion, trainees should be able to\napply successfully for individual grants and develop into independent clinical neuroscientists. We aim to create\nclinician-researchers who can combine clinical knowledge with superior research skills. The long-term goal is\nto help shape the new generation of leaders in clinical neuroscience. Drs. Kahn, Malaspina and New are each\nrenowned physician scientists who combine clinical expertise with deep research and training experience.\nThis program will fill an important gap in the otherwise impressive translational research program at the Icahn\nSchool of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), recognized as a top ten innovative research engine worldwide by\nNature. Indeed, the Departments of Neuroscience and Psychiatry are ranked #1 and #6 respectively in NIH\nfunding. We already have extensive experience, and a successful track record, in supporting other research\ncareer pathways, including a Physician-Scientist residency research track for MD, PhD trainees, and the first\nCombined Psychiatry Residency and PhD Training program in the US, funded by an NIMH R25 grant, of which\nDr. New is PI. We also have 6 K awardees and 2 K99/R00 investigators in our rich training programs.\nThe proposed T32 fellowship program is designed to train psychiatrists and clinical PhDs to formulate original\nresearch questions on etiology, pathogenesis, course, treatment and prevention of serious mental illness. Its\nfocus is on patients with schizophrenia and major mood disorders. Each trainee, paired with a mentor, will\nformulate a career development plan with targeted goals for acquisition of skills, presentations, publications,\ngathering pilot data, and preparation of proposals for external funding - usually a career development award.\nRegular meetings, internally and with an external advisory board, will monitor trainee development in relevant\nmilestones. We aim to help fill the dearth in clinical neuroscientists so that the recent advances in\nneuroscience can be translated into better care for the millions of patients with serious mental illness.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT:\nCognitive deficits are, arguably, the most prevalent, the most disabling, and the most economically costly\nsymptom of schizophrenia (SZ). There are, however, no FDA-approved medications to improve cognitive\nfunction in SZ. Computational models have proposed that cognitive deficits in SZ arise from disruptions to\ncortical excitation:inhibition (E:I) balance, and these models have inspired new outcome measures for\nrandomized control trials (RCTs), as well as new model paradigms for SZ. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether\ncomputational models of E:I balance in SZ will spur innovations in cognitive-enhancing therapeutics.\nConventional approaches to modeling of E:I balance in SZ are limited in several ways, which may negatively\nimpact their ability to improve the assessment and treatment of cognitive deficits among those with SZ. The\nfollowing F31 NRSA proposal seeks to translate a recently-validated modeling approach, which does not\nexhibit these limitations, to the study of E:I balance in SZ. Mesoscale Individualized Neurodynamic (MINDy)\nmodeling, which was created by members of this NRSA proposal team, is an approach for inferring the\nbiophysical parameters of an individual\u2019s brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.\nMINDy models provide a proxy-measure for E:I balance that is, unlike conventional computational models of\nE:I balance in SZ, both statistically reliable (Test-Retest R > 0.7) and quick to compute for every region of\ninterest in the brain (~1min compute time). The following NRSA proposal leverages these advantages to\ninvestigate disruptions in brain-wide E:I associated dynamics among those with SZ using a wide range of\nclinically-relevant study designs. For aim one of this NRSA, we will use MINDy to investigate brain wide\ndisruptions to E:I-associated dynamics among individuals with SZ by using resting-state fMRI data from the\nHuman Connectome Project \u2013 Early Psychosis (HCP-EP) study. While conventional approaches have\ndemonstrated that SZ is primarily associated with disruptions to E:I balance in association cortical areas such\nas the prefrontal cortex, there is some evidence that E:I balance may also be disrupted in sensory cortical\nareas. This has not been explored with computational models of E:I balance. We hypothesize that MINDy will\nuncover disruptions to E:I-associated dynamics in both association and sensory cortical areas among those\nwith SZ. For aim two of this NRSA, we will use MINDy to investigate genetic contributions to individual\ndifferences in brain-wide E:I balance among a sample of approximately 900 monozygotic and dizygotic twin\npairs from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Twin (ABCD-Twin) study. While existing work\nsuggests that general changes in gene expression across the neocortex are related to differences in E:I\nbalance between cortical areas, aim two of this NRSA proposal will be the first study to investigate whether the\ndistribution of E:I balance across the brain is related to individual differences in heritable genetic factors. Lastly,\naim 3 of this NRSA proposal will combine MINDy with a computational model of decision-making, called the\ndrift-diffusion model, in order to investigate links between brain-wide E:I balance and the efficiency of evidence\naccumulation during perceptual decision making. The contribution of E:I disruptions to cognitive deficits have\nprimarily only focused on the association cortex and also have only focused on working memory paradigms. In\norder to address both of these gaps, this F31 NRSA proposal will use MINDy modeling to investigate\nrelationships between brain-wide E:I disruptions in SZ and perceptual decision making.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Abstract\nThe goal of this project is to describe the function of synaptic adhesion molecules of the Neuroligin family\n(Nlgns) in the mouse brain and in human neurons. Recent single cell expression studies have highlighted the\nobversation that Nlgns are expressed also in non-neuronal cells, in particular oligodendrocyte precursors cells\n(OPCs) and astrocytes who express Nlgns to even higher levels than neurons. Since little is known about the\nfunction of Nlgns in glia and their effect on neurons and neural circuits, we propose to specifically delete Nlgns\nin OPCs and astrocytes using our triple conditional Nlgn1-3 knock-out strain. Brains will be characterized\nmorphologically, electrophysiologically on the cellular and circuit level, and mutant mice will be characterized\nby behavior. Next, we will perform an in-depth molecular characterization of the Neuroligin proteins by\ncharacterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying the surprising functional diversity of Nlgns. We will map\ntheir functional domains in mouse neurons by expressing various domain-mutant proteins in Nlgn1-4 quadruple\nknock-out cells. We will explore whether Nlgn sequence relates to functional specificity and investigate the\nnotion of a synaptic Neurexin \u201ccode\u201d that may determine Nlgn specificity.\n To complement our mouse studies and explore human-specific Neuroligin function as well as human\ndisease-associated mutations, we will capitalize on our previous human stem cell and reprogramming work in\nwhich we have developed human induced neuronal (iN) cells that exhibit all principal functional properties of\nprimary mouse neurons including robust synapse formation. We propose to utilize this system to investigate\nthe so far obscure function of NLGN4Y, a Y chromosomal gene closely related to NLGN4 on the X-\nchromosome and a member of the family not present in mouse. We will assess subcellular targeting by tagging\nthe endogenous locus and assess the functional consequences of genetic deletion. Another frequently mutated\nNlgn gene is NLGN3. Unlike NLGN4 it is better conserved in mice, but almost nothing is known about its\nfunction in human cells. In addition to generate loss-of-function alleles, we will study the functional\nconsequences of distinct ASD-associated mutations introduced into the human NLGN3 gene. We will use a\nconditional mutagenesis approach as we have successfully done in the past, as it allows the generation of a\nperfect control conidition derived from the identical cell line as the experimental condition. Mutant human\nneurons and controls will be characterized biochemically, morphologically, by gene expression, and\nelectrophysiologically. Finally, we propose to investigate the role of the proposed Nlgns-modulators MDGAs\nwhich are also found mutated in ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. We will assess their\nrequirement for proper synapse formation and function by generating loss-of-function alleles in human\nneurons. We will further probe their function as Neuroligin modulators as competitive Nlgn binding molecules.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe extent to which SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy affects the biology of the maternal-placental-fetal triad\nand neurodevelopmental trajectory in offspring is not known. Early studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can induce\nalterations in the placenta which can increase risk for adverse perinatal outcomes and, based on knowledge\nfrom other infectious and inflammatory disorders in pregnancy and preliminary data on the current pandemic,\nincrease risk for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in offspring. The long-term goal of this proposal is to\ntimely identify the impact of the ongoing pandemic on the neurodevelopment of infants born following maternal\nSARS-CoV-2 infection. The objective is to analyze the relationships between maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection,\nplacenta biology, and neurodevelopmental outcomes, in interaction with genomic risk (GRSs) for NDDs and sex.\nThe central hypothesis is that maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection and infection-related pregnancy complications\naffect early paths of brain development, particularly in those with high GRSs for NDDs and in males, and that\nthese effects are mediated by alterations in placenta morphology and molecular biology. The rationale underlying\nthe proposal is that completion will define critical targets for identification and potentially prevention of NDDs in\nthe offspring of infected mothers. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims:\n1) Determine pregnancy, placental, and newborn outcomes following antenatal SARS-CoV-2 infection; 2)\nInvestigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 maternal infection, GRSs for NDDs, and placenta molecular\nbiology; 3) Evaluate the relationship between maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, offspring genomic\nrisk factors for NDDs, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. We will pursue the aims using an innovative\ncombination of placenta tissue and maternal and fetal blood analysis, and comprehensive psychometric testing\nof early child neurodevelopment. We will compare woman-placenta-infant triads exposed to SARS-CoV-2\ninfection during pregnancy to unvaccinated and vaccinated controls. We will study how, in a large sample of\nmultiple ethnicities, maternal infection and stress, GRSs for NDDs, and sex, adversely affect\nneurodevelopmental outcomes of the offspring though processes mediated by alteration in placenta gene/protein\nexpression and maternal immune activation. The proposed research is significant, because it will characterize\nthe relationship between maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection and neurodevelopmental outcome of the offspring, and\nalso identify factors, molecules and genomic predictors that modulate, mediate or \u2013 as biomarkers \u2013 reveal such\nrelationship. The proximate expected outcome of this work will be an understanding of the mechanisms through\nwhich maternal infection, genomic risk and sex, placenta biology, and postnatal factors may contribute to define\nrisk for NDDs. The results will have an immediate positive impact to inform targeted interventions and guidelines\nfor SARS-CoV-2 exposed women and their infants, impacting how clinicians evaluate and care for these cases,\nand to identify potential biomarkers of risk for NDDs in offspring of mothers with infection during pregnancy.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of membrane receptors in human and have emerged\nas the largest family of drug targets with more than 35% of all drugs on the market functioning through GPCRs.\nDespite their desirability, to date, many GPCR families remain undrugged, partly due to lack of mechanistic\nknowledge about their activation and modulation. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are members of\nclass C GPCRs and are critical modulators of glutamate signaling. Due to their widespread expression in tissue\nand their central role they are among the most promising drug targets for the neurological disorders such as\nfragile X syndrome, epilepsy, anxiety, schizophrenia as well as some cancers. Advances in protein engineering\nand functional, structural and computational methods in the past twenty years have provided insights into the\narchitecture, signaling and expression patterns of mGluRs. However, a general model of how ligands change\nthe shape of mGluRs and how this conformational change is relayed across the membrane and over 12 nm to\nactivate specific signaling pathways is poorly understood. In this research we will develop a novel technology\nthat will allow us to watch a single mGluR protein while functioning in physiological conditions, in real time. This\nwill allow us to quantify the motions of different domains of the receptor that are involved in signaling. Next, we\nwill employ this approach to study how cholesterol and synthetic modulators of mGluR signaling affect protein\nconformation and dynamics to affect receptor signaling. This is a multi-disciplinary proposal where state-of-the-\nart in vitro single-molecule FRET (smFRET) spectroscopy is complemented by live-cell imaging, protein\nengineering and biophysical and biochemical methods. Once accomplished, the proposed research could\nprovide a critical step towards rational design of efficient drugs with fewer undesirable side effects. Furthermore,\nthese studies will provide a general roadmap for quantitative high-resolution structure-function studies of\nmammalian membrane proteins.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project summary/Abstract\nThe rewarding bonds we forge in adulthood, in particular our pair bonds with romantic partners, have innumerable\nprotective effects on our brains and behaviors. Individuals with difficulties in social engagement and competence, such\nas those suffering from social anxiety, major depression, ADHD, or Autism Spectrum Disorder, are particularly\nsusceptible to the health risks of social isolation and impoverished social networks. Aberrant activity of dopaminergic\nreward systems during adolescence coincides with the onset of many of these disorders, suggesting that developmental\nabnormalities in the neural substrates that promote social reward underlies disease pathology. Critically, most of what\nwe know about the neural mechanisms that facilitate pair bonding come from the study of adult brains, highlighting a\ndire need to investigate the functional development of social bonding circuits to design better therapeutic treatments\nfor social dysfunctions. The current proposal aims to leverage the socially monogamous prairie vole system to\ninvestigate the maturational changes in dopaminergic reward circuitry that initiate the capacity for pair bonding in\nadulthood. Prairie voles form strong pair bonds with their mates, which relies on the functional activity of dopamine\nsystems. In Aim 1, I will use fiber photometry to ask how developmental age and sex mediates socially induced changes\nin in vivo dopaminergic neural activity. In Aim 2, I will use chemogenetic approaches to investigate how perturbing\ndopamine circuits during sensitive developmental periods impacts adult pair bonding phenotypes. Finally, in Aim 3 I will\ninvestigate the developmental changes in transcriptional signatures of same\u2010sex and opposite\u2010sex social interactions as\nprairie voles mature and become capable of dopamine\u2010dependent pair bonding. Altogether, these efforts will determine\nhow social experiences across developmental time scaffold the maturation of pair bonding dopamine circuits. These\nfindings will profer novel insights into the molecular and cellular processes that may be disrupted in neuropsychiatric\nillnesses involving impaired bonding behaviors, which cannot be investigated in traditional non\u2010bonding rodent models.",

    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "Project Summary\nTo accurately code and react to the visual environment, signals from the retina must integrate with the spatial\nand temporal aspects of eye and body movements. Projections from the pretectum (PT) to the pulvinar\nnucleus (PUL) may serve in modifying visual signals in the context of eye and/or body movements. However,\nthe specific role of the PT in active vision has not been tested using precise circuity manipulation methods. In\nthe mouse, projections from the PT innervate rostral regions of the PUL that are reciprocally connected to\nthe primary visual cortex (V1). However, little is currently known regarding PT and rostral PUL circuits, or\nhow manipulation of the PT modifies rostral PUL activity. I propose to address these gaps in knowledge via\nthe following specific aims. Aim 1) Determine the ultrastructure, synaptic properties, and convergence\npatterns of layer 5 V1 and PT inputs to rostral PUL neurons using viral tracing, electron microscopy, in vitro\nrecording, and optogenetics. Aim 2) Characterize the morphology and response properties of retinal ganglion\ncells that innervate PT-PUL neurons using combinations of herpes simplex virus retrograde tracing,\nmonosynaptic rabies virus tracing, and in vitro two-photon fluorescence imaging of calcium signals. Aim 3)\nDetermine the response properties of PT neurons and how they affect the visual response properties of\nrostral PUL neurons by combining in vivo recordings from the PT and PUL of awake head-fixed mice with\noptogenetic inhibition of PT neurons. The goal of this project is to test the overarching hypothesis that the PT\nmodulates PUL visual signals in the context of animal movement.",

    "PRPSL_LONG_TITLE": "Role of cortical connections to higher-order thalamic nuclei in visual decision-making",
    "PRPSL_ABSTRACT": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nTo guide decisions, visual information must flow from primary visual cortex (V1) to prefrontal cortex (PFC), via\nmultiple, parallel cortico-cortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical connections. Both V1 and PFC have direct\nconnections with the pulvinar, a higher-order nucleus of the thalamus, but the role of this nucleus in sensory\nprocessing is still largely mysterious. Importantly, much of the pulvinar has no homologue in rodents or\ncarnivores, which makes studying it in nonhuman primates all the more important. This goal of this project is to\nuncover how direct connections between the cortex (V1 and PFC) and the pulvinar interact and impact visual\nperception and visually-guided decisions in non-human primates. To achieve this goal, the project proposes a\nnovel method, using focused ultrasound to non-invasively open the blood brain barrier, in order to precisely\ntarget cortico-thalamic projections for causal, optogenetic manipulations. Current evidence points to a critical\nrole for the pulvinar in redirecting visual attention, but its role in visually-guided decision-making and perception\nis less clear. To directly test how these cortico-thalamic projections affect visual perception and decision-making,\nthese circuits will be optogenetically activated while monkeys perform challenging psychophysical tasks. We will\nthen be able to assess the contribution of individual, cell-type specific, components of these circuits, by\nmeasuring changes in behavioral performance and differences in neural responses across multiple brain areas.\nThe proposed projects builds on my experience implementing multi-area electrophysiological recordings and\noptogenetic manipulations in awake, behaving primates. The training phase will allow me to develop novel\napproaches for transfecting larges areas with optogenetic constructs and practice targeting deep thalamic\nstructures in the primate brain electrophysiologically. The long-term goal for my research program is to resolve\nthe essential neural circuit that sensory information must pass through in order to become available for\nperceptually-based decisions. The central hypothesis for this is work is that cortical-thalamic loops are necessary\nfor the subjective experience of sensory inputs, and a fundamental feature of perceptual decision-making. My\ngoal is to apply this circuit-level knowledge of perceptual representations to improve brain function in the disease\nstate or following damage to sensory organs, but also to use this knowledge to improve how we can effectively\ncommunicate information to healthy brains.",
