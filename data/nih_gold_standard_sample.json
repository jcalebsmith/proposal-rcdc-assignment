The functions of skeletal muscle, brain, liver, bone, adipose tissue\nand heart all gain from various types of physical activity and training. People suffering from disabilities, morbid\nobesity, or age-related diseases, are usually physically inactive, which exacerbates their symptoms and leads to\ndevelopment of other types of diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and some\nforms of cancers. Scientific explorations of exercise have become more molecular, focusing on the pathways\nand molecules that mediate these benefits. Irisin has been identified as an exercise-induced hormone that\nembodies many adaptations to exercise in a variety of tissues/organs, including “browning” of subcutaneous\nadipose tissue, bone remodeling, improving cognitive deficits and neuropathology, and promoting myogenesis\nof skeletal muscles.\nIn bone and fat, the effects of irisin are mediated via αv integrins, with αvβ5 identified as the major receptor.\nHowever, my biochemical and biophysical characterization of direct interaction between irisin and αvβ5\nsuggested extremely weak binding, while the concentrations of irisin that induce detectable amount of\nirisin-mediated effects in the body and in the cultured cells are really low, indicating a very high irisin/receptor\nbinding affinity. This paradox could be explained by the existence of an additional factor that facilitates\nirisin/integrin interaction and irisin-mediated integrin activation. My preliminary data suggested that an\nexercise-induced circulating protein Hsp90α binds to integrin αvβ5, and functions as a cofactor to mediate the\nbinding of irisin to integrin and irisin-induced integrin signaling. Irisin is different from many integrin ligands in\nthat irisin is small, heavily glycosylated, and lacks the well-identified integrin binding motif, indicating a\nnon-canonical ways of ligand binding to integrins.\nBiophysical and biochemical approaches will be used to characterize the complexes formed by irisin (WT and\nglycosylation mutants), αvβ5 and Hsp90α. The molecular model will be firstly tested in HEK293T cells\nectopically expressing αv and β5, and muscle and fat cells, using molecular approaches and fluorescence\nmicroscopy. The effects of Hsp90α will be further evaluated in mice. Taken together, these studies will advance\nour understanding of irisin-mediated (or hormone-mediated, in general) integrin signaling, which will assist drug\nand antibody development to treat patients with obesity, aged-related diseases and neuro- or muscular\ndegenerative disorders.\nThe proposed project represents a great balance between biochemistry/biophysics as well as cell biology, in\nwhich I was trained during my Ph.D, and cell metabolism and animal physiology, which are the primary\ntechnologies employed by the Spiegelman lab. The resources provided by Bruce’s networks, DFCI and HMS,\ntremendously facilitated my research, and will support me to become an independent scientist.","project_title":"Elucidating novel molecular mechanisms of irisin-mediated effects via integrin","spending_categories_desc":"Biotechnology; Obesity; Physical Activity; Prevention"},{"abstract_text":"Shigella spp. are major enteric pathogens, causing acute diarrhea and bacillary dysentery leading to severe mortality and morbidity worldwide. Yet, there is no licensed vaccine to prevent shigellosis. Shigella virulence requires a T3SS and at least 30 secreted effectors that are often functionally redundant, yet required to invade host cells, maintain a replicative niche, minimize alarm signals, and promote colonization. We previously showed that S. flexneri T3SS activity is detected in macrophages by Caspase-1 inflammasomes, resulting in pyroptosis. In the recent mouse shigellosis model, the role of the inflammasome is only focused on gut intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). However, it is generally believed that Shigella initially infect macrophages and takes advantage of pyroptotic cell death to exit the cells and subsequently infect IECs. On the other hand, macrophage pyroptosis is known to generate pore-induced traps (PITs), trapping, and neutralizing intracellular bacterial pathogens. Since macrophages pyroptosis is considered to play dichotomous roles during Shigella infection, we propose to investigate the interaction between macrophages' inflammasomes and S. flexneri. We propose two specific Aims: In Aim1, we will investigate how pyroptotic macrophages from PITs trap intracellular bacteria. In Aim 2. We will define the role of pyroptotic macrophages and PITs during S. flexneri infection in vitro and in vivo. We hope that examining the role of macrophages pyroptosis against S. flexneri infection, will be highly significant and relevant for better understanding immunity and disease pathologies during Shigella infection and thereby providing the basis for developing novel safer, and more effective vaccines.","project_title":"Pyroptotic Macrophages Traps Against Shigella Infection","spending_categories_desc":"Biodefense and Related Countermeasures; Digestive Diseases; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Foodborne Illness; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Vaccine Related"},{"abstract_text":"The broad long-term objective of this project is to improve the success rate of novel mood\ndisorder therapeutics by enhancing the reliability and generalizability of Clinician Reported\nOutcomes (ClinROs) in clinical trials.

The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to address the national opioid public health crisis and improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction.\nThis project seeks to address the overdose epidemic by working with overdose fatality review (OFR) teams. Current OFR practices rely on the case review model to make policy and programmatic recommendations. However, the continued rise in overdose rates and sheer number of preventable overdose deaths suggest a need to shift OFR teams away from case review and toward using timely population-level data to better inform their recommendations and actions. The goal of our proposed project, Fatal Overdose Review Teams – Research to Enhance Surveillance Systems (FORTRESS), is to improve standard OFR practices by equipping OFRs with a data dashboard built on real-time aggregate data, record-linked across multiple sources and presented in a way that helps identify and visualize common “overdose touchpoints,” or opportunities to deliver harm-reduction services or engage individuals at risk for overdose in evidence-based treatment. Aligning with the goals of the HEAL Data2Action Program, the FORTRESS research team will leverage available resources and expertise to help OFRs translate data to action. During the R61 Phase, the research team will strengthen established cross-sector partnerships with two state agencies, the Indiana Department of Health and the Indiana Management Performance Hub (MPH), which provide the necessary statewide data infrastructure to record-link population-level administrative data from multiple sources. MPH has also successfully developed publicly accessible data dashboards. The FORTRESS team will build on the early successes of MPH to ensure more timely collection of overdose event data and design the “Overdose Touchpoints Dashboard” (Aim 1). Our team will train OFR team members in Data-Driven Decision Making (DDDM) to effectively use the dashboard. The FORTRESS team also includes individuals involved in developing the CDC’s OFR best practice guidelines and a pilot study of OFR adherence to these guidelines, which will inform our team’s development of an “OFR Fidelity Tool” (Aim 2). This tool will be the first of its kind. For the R33 phase, we will conduct a cluster-randomized stepped-wedge trial comparing the impact of our intervention (dashboard + DDDM training) versus standard OFR practices on both implementation (Aim 3) and effectiveness outcomes (Aim 4). Implementation outcomes include implementation\nprocess fidelity (Stages of Implementation Completion), staff acceptance of harm reduction philosophies (qualitative interviews), OFR fidelity to CDC best practices (FORTRESS OFR Fidelity Tool), and usability of the Overdose Touchpoint Dashboard, (Systems Usability Scale). A statewide OFR data repository serves as a rich source of data on effectiveness outcomes, including OFR team recommendation quality and local actions to implement recommended overdose prevention strategies. We will also survey OFR team members to assess changes in their attitudes toward evidence-based overdose prevention strategies. In sum, the FORTRESS team is uniquely qualified to help OFRs use more comprehensive, available data to inform quality, action-oriented recommendations to reduce overdose.","project_title":"Fatal Overdose Review Teams - Research to Enhance Surveillance Systems (FORTRESS)","spending_categories_desc":"Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Dissemination and Implementation Research; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Harm Reduction for Substance Misuse; Opioid Misuse and Addiction; Opioids; Physical Injury - Accidents and Adverse Effects; Prevention; Substance Misuse; Substance Misuse Prevention"},{"abstract_text":"PROJECT SUMMARY\nLewy body disorders, a subset of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRDs), are the second most\ncommon neurodegenerative disorders worldwide and the 14th leading cause of death in the United States.\nLewy body ADRDs are progressive, incurable, and mortality rates are rising, making end-of-life (EoL) care a\nsignificant public health concern. The majority of persons with Lewy body ADRDs are hospitalized in their last\n6 months of life with high rates of intensive care unit admission, in-hospital death, and low rates of discharge to\nhospice care. Because these markers of poor care quality are often incongruent with patient care preferences,\nurgent interventions are needed to improve EoL care quality in acute care hospitals. Despite this critical need,\nthere are two fundamental knowledge gaps in developing inpatient EoL interventions for persons with Lewy\nbody ADRDs: 1) lack of a prognostic model to determine risk of 6-month mortality and 2) lack of a validated\ntool to measure EoL care quality. This proposal requests support for a mentored career development award for\nDr. Whitley Aamodt, a movement disorders specialist, neurodegenerative neurologist, and clinical researcher\nat the University of Pennsylvania. The overarching goal of this project is to improve prognostication and EoL\ncare quality for hospitalized persons with Lewy body ADRDs by identifying patients at the greatest risk of death\nand ensuring that hospital-based care is appropriate and aligned with care preferences. In Aim 1, Dr. Aamodt\nwill use comprehensive Medicare data to develop a risk-prediction model for 6-month all-cause mortality in a\nnationally representative sample of hospitalized patients with Lewy body ADRDs using advanced predictive\nmodeling. This model will be externally validated in a second cohort of Medicare beneficiaries from the post-\npandemic period. In Aim 2, Dr. Aamodt will create, test, and externally validate a patient-centered EoL care\nquality instrument based on data gathered from diverse Lewy body ADRD patients, care partners, and\npractitioners using qualitative research methods and factor analysis. In executing these aims, Dr. Aamodt will\nobtain additional training in neuroepidemiology, biostatistics, and qualitative research under the guidance of\nmentors and advisors in epidemiologic research methods (John Farrar, MD, PhD), neurodegenerative disease\nepidemiology and health services research (Allison Willis, MD, MS), predictive modeling (Warren Bilker, PhD),\nqualitative research methods (Katharine Rendle, PhD, MPH), and palliative care research (Scott Halpern, MD,\nPhD). The results of this project will provide fundamental knowledge about hospitalized patients with Lewy\nbody ADRDs nearing EoL and will guide the development of future interventions to improve EoL care quality.\nThis work aligns with the strategic goal of the National Institute on Aging to address EoL care needs in ADRDs.\nThrough the research training and mentorship gained during this career development award, Dr. Aamodt will\nestablish herself as an independent investigator in the field of applied epidemiology, outcomes research, and\npalliative and EoL care for aging Americans with neurodegenerative diseases.","project_title":"Improving End-of-Life Care for Hospitalized Patients with Lewy Body Disorders","spending_categories_desc":"Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD); Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Dementia; Health Services; Lewy Body Dementia; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Palliative Care; Patient Safety"},{"abstract_text":"Project Summary\nThe objective of this project is to investigate voice changes associated with speaking in challenging acoustic\nenvironments to better inform clinical care for individuals with voice disorders. Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD)\nis a common voice disorder that often results in difficulty communicating in daily life. Many people experience\nvoice symptoms from speaking in noisy environments; for most, the symptoms resolve quickly. However, for\nthose with MTD, voice symptoms often persist, making it difficult for them to meet their occupational and social\nvocal demands. The reasons for this persistence are unknown. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate the\nunderlying mechanisms of voice production in noisy environments to optimize and individualize voice\nassessment and treatment for these individuals with MTD. Most speakers increase their vocal intensity while\nspeaking in noisy environments, a phenomenon known as the Lombard effect. Speaking during and after\nexposure to a loud environment presumably requires monitoring of both background noise and one’s own voice,\nand then responding with vocal motor adjustments. This implies that sensorimotor integration is crucial in these\nreal-life circumstances. There is preliminary evidence that individuals with MTD have atypical auditory-motor\nintegration and an atypical persistence of Lombard responses after speaking in noise. However, no known\nstudies have comprehensively characterized the underlying mechanisms and clinically relevant voice changes\nof the Lombard effect for those with and without MTD. To develop evidenced-based diagnostics and targeted\nvoice treatments, we must better understand the processes and voice changes associated with speaking in daily\nlife. Therefore, the specific aims of this project are to 1) investigate the sensorimotor mechanisms of the Lombard\neffect and 2) characterize clinically relevant voice changes associated with the Lombard effect for individuals\nwith and without MTD within a communicative context. Sixty speakers (30 with MTD and 30 without) will complete\na Lombard task to measure vocal responses and self-reported vocal effort while communicating during and after\nexposure to a noisy environment. Inexperienced listeners will rate overall severity of dysphonia for the speakers’\nspeech samples from the Lombard task. Lombard responses will be analyzed behaviorally and neuro-\ncomputationally, and they will be compared between the groups and across various stages of the Lombard task.\nClinically relevant vocal measures (i.e., acoustic, self-reported vocal effort, and listener-auditory perceptual\nratings of overall severity of dysphonia) of the Lombard task will be compared across groups and phases of the\nexperimental task. This project is theoretically and clinically significant; it will fill in a substantial gap, providing\ntheoretical insight into the sensorimotor mechanisms of MTD in real-life environmental contexts, and contributing\nto the clinical evidence to improve diagnostics and individualize treatment for those with sensorimotor deficits\nunderlying their voice disorders.","project_title":"The Lombard effect in muscle tension dysphonia: mechanistic and clinical characterization","spending_categories_desc":"Clinical Research; Neurosciences"},{"abstract_text":"PROJECT SUMMARY\n The long-term goal of this K23 Career Development Award is to prepare the PI (Rachel Aaron, PhD) for\nan independent research career that aims to promote adaptive recovery for individuals who survive orthopedic\ntrauma. Orthopedic trauma, resulting in severe injuries such as multiple fractures or amputation, occurs in\naround 3 million people annually in the United States; about half of survivors experience persistent pain and\npsychological distress in the year following injury, and most report substantial disability 7 years post trauma.\nThere is an urgent need to identify factors that underlie pain and psychological distress following orthopedic\ntrauma and to develop targeted psychological interventions to treat these potentially disabling symptoms.\n The broader literature suggests that difficulties with emotion regulation (i.e., identifying one's emotions\nand engaging in strategies to up- or down-regulate them) and central sensitization (i.e., alterations in the\nendogenous modulation of pain) lead to poor pain-related outcomes. Using a theory-driven assessment of\nemotion regulation, and gold-standard, laboratory-based assessment of central sensitization (quantitative\nsensory testing [QST]), Study 1 will examine emotion regulation difficulties and central sensitization at 6 weeks\npost trauma as predictors of persistent pain, distress, and opioid use 6 months post trauma.

The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) further identify needs and gaps in research administration\nand management at UNN; 2) improve the grants management and proposal development knowledge and skills\nof UNN research administrators and HIV implementation researchers; and 3) strengthen the ability of UNN\nresearch administrators and HIV implementation researchers to submit and manage successful HIV grant\napplications by providing mentorship, ongoing coaching and online courses from UCSD program instructors. UC\nSan Diego experts in research administration and grant management will implement the objectives of the\nproposed infrastructure development training program. The proposed program will be led by Dr. Gregory Aarons,\nProfessor and Director of UC San Diego Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute Dissemination and\nImplementation Science Center (DISC) as Program Director, and Dr. Echezona Ezeanolue, Professor and\nDirector of UNN Centre for Translation and Implementation Research (CTAIR) as Co-Director. Drs. Aarons and\nEzeanolue have an existing relationship and extensive experience building capacity in Nigerian institutions\nthrough the Nigeria Implementation Science Alliance (NISA). A team of research administration and grant\nmanagement experts from UC San Diego will train and provide ongoing mentoring to research administrators\nand grant management staff at UNN over a 3-year period.

With\nan estimated female population of 102 million and HIV prevalence of 1.6% among adult females, Nigeria has the\nlargest population of women and the 4th largest number of women living with HIV (WLHIV) in Africa. Although\naccess to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among WLHIV in Nigeria has increased over the years, with over 98% of\nthe 960,000 WLHIV on ART, AIDS-related mortality remains high. In 2020, 16,000 WLHIV died from AIDS-\nrelated illnesses including cervical cancer. A pilot implementation program in Nigeria demonstrated that\nleveraging the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) supported HIV programs for the\nprovision of evidence-based cervical cancer screen-and-treat interventions in WLWH is feasible. The pilot\nprogram demonstrated, however, that tailored implementation strategies will be needed to address specific\nmultilevel barriers along the cancer control continuum in order to address adoption, reach, and sustainability that\nare necessary for successful scale-up. However, in many African countries with a high burden of both HIV and\ncervical cancer, there is a paucity of evidence-based implementation strategies to inform effective integration of\nHIV and cervical cancer services delivery. Objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Refine strategies to integrate\ncervical cancer screening, treatment and management within existing comprehensive HIV treatment programs\nand determine implementation readiness; 2) Determine the comparative effectiveness of a Core set of\nimplementation strategies versus Core+ enhanced implementation strategies; and 3) assess sustainment of the\nintegration of cervical cancer screening, treatment, and management intervention into HIV programs.

Recent studies in small animal models indicate that WTC dust particles or metals are\nundetectable or present at exceedingly low levels in prostate tissues compared to lung following WTC dust\nexposure by inhalation or gavage (Wang, 2022; Gong, 2019), and long-term studies of rodents have not revealed\nevidence of a direct carcinogenic mechanism. Instead, there is evidence from both human RNA expression and\nDNA methylation analyses (Yu, 2022) and animal models (Wang, 2022; Gong, 2019) that inflammation induced\nby this dust may be implicated in promoting prostate cancer. In the mouse, WTC dust exposure promotes\nsystemic as well as localized prostate inflammation, increased growth in PTEN deficient prostate epithelia and\npromotion of genetically initiated prostate tumors (Wang, 2022).\nAim 1 will investigate whether WTC associated prostate cancer is more likely to recur independent of tumor\ngrade at diagnosis and if there are molecular signatures of aggressiveness at diagnosis in those who recur. We\nwill utilize increased biochemical (PSA) recurrence to define responders with adverse clinical response to WTC\ndust following surgery or radiation therapy. We will also apply recently identified signatures by RNA expression\nanalysis and mass spec multiplex immunostaining of primary prostate cancer tissues to test whether these\nimmune/inflammatory markers correlate with increased tumor recurrence in WTC responders.\nAim 2 will focus on correlating our human findings with those in mouse genetically engineered mouse models\nbearing targeted lesions to prostate that model human PC. These experiments take advantage of our strong\npreliminary evidence that these models support a role of WTC dust exposure in PC progression.

Increasing in prevalence, COPD\nis a major burden to patients and providers. Computed tomography (CT) can provide valuable information\nabout the structural and functional abnormalities of the disease as demonstrated in numerous studies where\nquantitative CT is deployed to characterize and evaluate the treatment. For instance, the COPDGene study\nhas recently shown the substantial role of quantitative CT in the redefinition of COPD diagnosis, and in\nevaluating the progression of emphysema over time. However, these biomarkers vary across different\nscanners, settings, and patient attributes. There is a crucial need to manage this variability by optimizing and\nharmonizing CT images for reliable biomarker quantifications across both current and emerging scanners.\nThis goal is not possible through conventional methods of using physical phantoms or patient images. Physical\nphantoms are often oversimplified and not representative of the complex anatomy and physiology of COPD\npatients. Patient images are ground-truth-limited, i.e., the exact anatomy and physiology of the patient is not\nfully known. Further, patient-based comparisons require multiple acquisitions of the same subjects across\ndifferent scanners and settings. This is not ethically possible since repeated imaging increases the absorbed\nradiation dose. These challenges can be overcome through the use of virtual imaging trials (VITs) where\nstudies are performed in silico using computational models of patients and scanners. VITs can provide reliable\nand practical solution to the challenge of COPD imaging provided realistic models of patients and scanners.\nSuch models are currently lacking in the context of COPD.\nWe develop and then utilize realistic virtual imaging toolsets to systematically evaluate and optimize CT\nbiomarkers in COPD patients across scanners, imaging parameters, and patient attributes. We develop the\nfirst library of realistic COPD patient models with diverse attributes and severities. Coupled with accurate\nmodels of different scanners, the phantoms will be used to generate sets of ground-truth-known virtual CT\ncases, to be disseminated to the research community and to be used to systematically evaluate the effects of\ncurrent and emerging scanners, various patient attributes, and the effects of image processing algorithms\n(through a national challenge), on the accuracy and precision of COPD biomarkers. Further, we develop and\noptimize a truth-based artificial intelligence-based algorithm for COPD quantifications. We optimize the\nalgorithm for accuracy and reproducibility, taking advantage of the ground-truth known simulated images\n.

Yet, persistent symptoms and enteropathy remain commonplace even\namong CeD patients that adhere to a GFD. This stresses the need to develop non-dietary interventions for\nCeD. The development of new therapies has however proven challenging because of our incomplete\nunderstanding of the immune mechanisms underlying CeD pathogenesis and the lack of a suitable mouse\nmodel. CeD is characterized by the loss of oral tolerance to gluten manifested by HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8-\nrestricted anti-gluten inflammatory CD4 T cells in the small intestinal mucosa and by a massive expansion of\ncytotoxic intraepithelial CD8+ lymphocytes (IE-CTLs) that are involved in the killing of intestinal epithelial cells.\nThese observations have led to the general idea that CeD is primarily a T cell-mediated immune disorder. We\nhypothesize, however, that B cells also play a critical role. This hypothesis stems from several observations.\nFirst, CeD is characterized by a considerable expansion of plasma cells in the mucosa of CeD patients as well\nas the development of anti-deamidated gluten peptides (DGP) antibodies and autoantibodies against the\nenzyme tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Second, the main model to explain the production of anti-DGP and\nanti-TG2 antibodies is that gluten-specific CD4+ T cells provide help to B cells suggesting that B cells could act\nas antigen-presenting cells for T cells and promote the amplification of the anti-gluten CD4 T cell response.\nFinally, several case reports on patients having CeD associated with another autoimmune disease suggest\nthat B cell depletion therapy can provide clinical benefit in CeD, and we have demonstrated that B cell\ndepletion significantly reduces intestinal tissue damage in our mouse model of CeD. The objective of this\napplication is to characterize in vivo the role of B cells in amplifying the anti-gluten T cell response and allow it\nto reach a sufficient magnitude to promote tissue destruction. This project is innovative as it employs unique\nmouse models of CeD allowing to manipulate B lymphocytes, gluten-specific T cells, the gluten antigen, and\nthe CeD predisposing HLA molecule to 1) assess the contribution of B cells as antigen-presenting to the\nactivation and amplification of the anti-gluten CD4+ T cell response, and 2) assess the role of B cells and\nantibodies in the activation of IE-CTLs and tissue destruction. The knowledge gained from this study will\nprovide unprecedented insights into the mechanisms by which B cell-mediated immunity contribute to the\npathogenesis of CeD and will assess for the first time the therapeutic potential of B cell depletion therapy in an\nexperimental mouse model of CeD.","project_title":"B cell-T cell crosstalk in celiac disease","spending_categories_desc":"Autoimmune Disease; Celiac Disease; Digestive Diseases; Immunotherapy; Nutrition"},{"abstract_text":"Dr. Peter Abadir is an active Geriatrician and associate professor of Medicine, Electrical, and Computer Engineering at Johns Hopkins University (JHU).

Mechanistic\nstudies will be performed in male and female Dahl Salt-Sensitive (SS) rats, with translational studies performed\nin samples from opposite-sex twin pairs where the males have hypertension compared to females.\nDahl SS rats, a model consistent with human salt-sensitive hypertension, exhibit a greater degree of salt-\nsensitivity and associated end-organ damage in males compared to females. We have observed stark sex\ndifferences in gut microbiota composition and gut-derived metabolites. Through microbiota transfer studies, we\nknow the gut microbiota plays a causal role in the regulation of BP and renal damage. Linking the microbiota to\nimmunity, microbiota transfer also influences renal T cell infiltration. Genetic deletion of T cells (SSCD247–/–)\neliminates sex differences in salt-sensitive hypertension, highlighting the role of T cells to mediate BP sex\ndifferences. Since the gut microbiota influences renal T cell infiltration, and T cells amplify salt-sensitive\nhypertension, we have strong rationale for studying how sex-specific microbiota impact T cell function and salt-\nsensitivity.

Sex-specific microbiota transfer and gonadectomy studies\nwill reveal whether the gut microbiota sex- and hormone-dependently contributes to salt-sensitive hypertension\nin SS rats.

Studies in the\nnematode Caenorhabditis elegans show that bacterial colonization of the intestine results in the\nactivation of the expression of innate immune genes in the gut and the activation of a neuroendocrine\nsignal that controls pathogen avoidance.

Traditional bronchodilators and anti-\ninflammatory medications, as well as programs to monitor and treat symptoms, have a modest effect on reducing\nhospital admissions. Readmission rates remain unacceptably high, so alternative approaches are needed. In this\nregard, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is remarkably effective, and is associated with an 80% reduction in admission\nrates. Successful completion of PR is also associated with substantial improvements in quality of life, dyspnea, as\nwell as exercise tolerance. Despite these benefits, recent studies have highlighted very poor referral rates for PR\noverall and as low as 1.9% post-hospitalization, and non-completion rates as high as 60%. The poor adaptation of\nPR in the community is due to a combination of barriers in availability and accessibility, as well as attrition. The\nnumber of PR centers in the United States is inadequate, and these centers are mostly distributed in urban areas.\nIn addition, multiple socioeconomic and medical barriers hinder access to PR, and contribute to high drop-out rates.\n New strategies are needed to reduce hospital readmission in COPD, and to increase the delivery of PR to\nunderserved urban as well as rural areas in the community. Given the scarcities in existing resources, conventional\nmodels of care delivery are being challenged, and attempts are being made to find alternative, cost-effective ways\nof delivering healthcare to a larger number of eligible patients. To overcome the socioeconomic and physical\nbarriers to PR, we hypothesize that a video telehealth intervention that will deliver PR to the patient's home,\nregardless of geographic location, will reduce hospital readmissions in COPD, and reduce respiratory morbidity. To\ntest our hypothesis we propose a prospective randomized controlled phase 3 multicenter clinical trial comparing a\nreal-time video telehealth PR intervention plus standard of care versus standard of care alone, with the following\nSpecific Aims: (1) To determine if a video telehealth PR intervention reduces 30-day all-cause readmissions in\npatients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of COPD, (2) To evaluate the effects of the video telehealth PR\nintervention on dyspnea and respiratory quality of life in COPD post hospital discharge, and (3) To evaluate the\ncost-effectiveness of the telehealth intervention. Accomplishment of the aims of this study will result in a significant\nreduction in COPD readmission rates, and a paradigm shift in the way PR is delivered to patients with COPD,\nespecially those that reside in remote and rural areas with limited access to pulmonary rehabilitation.","project_title":"2/2 Video Telehealth Pulmonary Rehabilitation to Reduce Hospital Readmission in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (Tele-COPD)","spending_categories_desc":"Behavioral and Social Science; Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Cost Effectiveness Research; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Health Services; Lung; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Patient Safety; Physical Activity; Physical Rehabilitation; Rehabilitation; Rural Health; Social Determinants of Health; Telehealth"},{"abstract_text":"Abstract\nTuberculous meningitis (TBM) disproportionally affects people in low- and middle-income countries and is\nassociated with high morbidity and mortality.

The overall objective of this proposal is to use transcranial doppler and\nbrain imaging to understand changes in cerebral blood vessels and cerebral blood flow in order to determine\nchanges in cerebrovascular responsiveness, characterize patterns of stroke, and describe long-term\nneurocognitive outcomes in HIV-associated TBM. The central hypothesis is that in HIV-infected individuals,\nTBM causes extensive cerebral vascular narrowing and impaired cerebrovascular responsiveness, decreased\ncerebral blood flow, and ultimately stroke. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims:\n1) describe changes in cerebrovascular responsiveness in HIV-associated TBM; 2) characterize the patterns of\nstroke in HIV-associated TBM and determine whether it is associated with vasculopathy and/or impairments in\ncerebrovascular responsiveness; and 3) determine if impaired cerebrovascular responsiveness predicts long-\nterm neurological outcome in HIV-associated TBM. Under Aim 1, transcranial doppler will be used to take\nrepeated measurements of the middle cerebral artery flow velocity and pulsatility index. A subset of study\nsubjects will also have dynamic measurements made in response to stimuli (inhaled CO2, changes in blood\npressure, and motor tasks). We will determine whether cerebrovascular responsiveness is impaired in HIV-\nassociated TBM by comparing measurements to those of control patients with no neurological infection. Under\nAim 2, all study subjects will have a brain MRI performed within the first 2-weeks of TBM treatment to identify\nthe presence of a cerebral artery stroke and the associated cerebral artery territory. We will compare TCD\nreadings between participants with or without stroke. Under Aim 3, we will examine how TCD measurements at\nstudy enrolment relate to the results of neurocognitive testing at month 2 and functional assessment at month\n6. Ultimately, the long-term goal of the proposal is to describe how impaired cerebrovascular responsiveness in\nHIV-associated TBM contributes to the development of strokes and resulting neurocognitive impairment and\ndisability. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it incorporates the use of\ntranscranial doppler at the bedside, to be used in real time, in the care of subjects with TBM. The proposed\nresearch is significant because it is expected to provide strong scientific justification for the development of\nfuture clinical trials testing targeted interventions to improve cerebrovascular responsiveness and prevent the\ndevelopment of strokes in HIV-associated TBM.

As a result, the clinician must perform additional tests to identify which of the positives is causative.\nAlthough these tests use quantitative PCR, in clinical labs the results are reported as presence/absence due to\nthe finicky nature of PCR in this setting, which is sensitive to minor variations in reaction efficiency, operator\nvariability. As a result, today, only a few widespread PCR tests are FDA approved to report quantitative result.\nIn contrast to qPCR, digital PCR (dPCR) measures target titers by counting individual molecules. As a result,\ndPCR provides an absolute concentration measurement that doesn’t require a standard curve. In addition, the\nreaction is cycled to endpoint, then quantified; it does not require careful estimation of the amplification rate,\nwhich is a major source of variability in qPCR. Thus, dPCR is less sensitive to variations in reaction efficiency\nand provides superior consistency. However, current dPCR methods are limited in multiplexing, allowing just 5-\n6 targets per assay, while qPCR can test up to 100. Moreover, dPCR requires complex microfluidic equipment\nthat burdens testing lab personnel and increases cost. Until these issues can be addressed, qPCR will continue\nto dominate the clinical lab, and quantitative and absolute pathogen load reporting will remain beyond reach.\nHere, we propose a novel nucleic acid technology combining the quantitativeness and robustness of dPCR with\nthe simplicity and multiplexing of qPCR. Our vision is to enable broad spectrum detection wherein each pathogen\nis associated with a high confidence, quantitative titer.

Importantly, ZOL treatment\ninduces accumulation of phosphoantigens in tumor cells, which are detected by γδ T cells. Our preliminary\nfindings show that ZOL can enhance γδ T-cells' homing to bone where they can prevent cancer growth via\nCAR and via endogenous T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition. γδ CAR-T treatment, in presence or absence of\nZOL, can mitigate cancer-induced bone deterioration.

The notion of a suppressive function of KIR2DL2 expression in CD8+ T cells is supported by the\nobservation that patients that express its cognate ligand, HLA-C1, showed decreased overall survival and\ncould not control tumor growth.

We have also developed a new\nprecision oncology platform called OncoLoop, to computationally match individual patients to individual GEMMs,\nand to predict and validate drugs that target specific patient-GEMM pairs.\n Leveraging these models and resources, we will systematically investigate the functions of BRCA1 and\nBRCA2 in prostate cancer, guided by the hypothesis that defective DNA repair plays an important role in\nprostate cancer progression and treatment, particularly in the context of androgen deprivation. In Aim 1, we will\ninvestigate the consequences of loss-of-function of Brca1 and Brca2 in GEMMs, GEMM-derived organoid\nmodels, and patient-derived human organoid models for prostate tumorigenesis, metastasis, and DNA damage\nresponse. These studies will provide fundamental insights into the functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in prostate\ncancer and elucidate the relationship of DNA repair mechanisms for disease progression. In Aim 2, we will\ninvestigate molecular determinants of DNA repair functions in prostate cancer by identifying and functionally\ncharacterizing master regulators (MRs) that represent mechanistic determinants of Brca1 and Brca2 loss-of-\nfunction in prostate tumors and metastases. MRs will be prioritized based on conservation with human prostate\ncancer, and functionally validated in mouse and human organoids. We will complement these studies by\nanalyses of tumors and metastases using single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) to identify MR signatures\nassociated with specific cell states. In Aim 3, we will leverage our GEMMs, GEMM-derived organoids and\nallografts, and patient-derived organotypic models to pursue co-clinical investigations of DNA repair function in\nprostate cancer. In Aim 3A, we will systematically evaluate drugs/drug combinations currently in or advancing\nto clinical practice. In Aim 3B, we will use the OncoLoop platform to predict new drugs that target DNA repair in\nprostate-specific contexts. Overall, these studies will provide biological and molecular insights to inform on\ncurrent trials and to support the development of future ones.","project_title":"Preclinical analyses of advanced prostate cancer in genetically-engineered mice","spending_categories_desc":"Cancer; Genetics; Precision Medicine; Prostate Cancer; Urologic Diseases"},{"abstract_text":"The major cause of bladder cancer deaths is due to metastasis, yet to date metastatic bladder cancer\n(mMIBC) has not been extensively studied and many salient issues remain unresolved. One of the major\nchallenges that has hampered progress in studying mMIBC is the lack of suitable models to investigate\nmetastatic progression in vivo. We have now generated novel genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs)\nthat develop highly penetrant mMIBC. These new are based on our established GEMM, in which bladder-specific\nco-inactivation of the Pten and p53 tumor suppressors leads to invasive disease with a low incidence of\nmetastasis. Crossing these Pten; p53 mice with mice harboring loss-of-function of Arid1a, an epigenetic regulator\nthat is dysregulated in a high percentage of human bladder cancers, results in lethal bladder cancer with >80%\nincidence of metastasis. In addition, treatment of the Pten; p53 mice with a low dose of the carcinogen N-butyl-\nN-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN) leads to mMIBC with >60% incidence. In parallel, we have implemented\nstate-of-the-art systems biology approaches to identify mechanistic determinants—master regulators (MRs)—of\nmetastatic progression in the GEMMs. MRs enriched in metastatic tumors in the GEMMs are conserved with\nhuman bladder cancer, and are enriched for those associated with lineage plasticity. To identify drugs that target\nthese conserved MRs, we implemented OncoTreat, a computational algorithm that prioritizes drugs based on\ntheir ability to invert the activities of biologically-relevant MR. To validate these drugs, we have generated an\nextensive biobank of human patient derived organoid models. Leveraging these GEMMs, human patient derived\norganoids and systems approaches, we are ideally poised to investigate the hypothesis that the transition from\npre-invasive to metastatic disease is driven by the sequential activities of master regulators, including for lineage\nplasticity, which can be elucidated and targeted by studying metastatic progression in these GEMMs. We will\npursue three Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will leverage our GEMMs of mMIBC to systematically investigate the\nbiological processes and molecular mechanisms underlying metastatic progression in vivo. In Aim 2, we will\nelucidate master regulators of metastatic progression, focusing on those associated with the transition from pre-\nmetastatic to metastatic MIBC, and/or that distinguish tumors from their corresponding metastases, metastases\nto different organ sites, and, as feasible, pre-metastatic clusters from overt metastases. We will prioritize MRs\nthat are conserved with human bladder cancer, as well as those associated with lineage plasticity. In Aim 3, we\nwill seek to identify new drugs for mMIBC using the OncoTreat algorithm to identify compounds that invert the\nactivity of MRs of metastasis. We will prioritize candidate drugs that (1) target lineage plasticity mechanisms,\nand/or (2) are inferred for patients that do not have evident actionable driver mutations. Altogether, our studies\nwill provide a comprehensive analysis of the biology, mechanisms, and treatments for mMIBC, with the\ntranslational goal of identifying new therapeutic targets that may improve patient outcomes.","project_title":"Investigating mechanisms of bladder cancer metastasis","spending_categories_desc":"Cancer; Clinical Research; Genetics; Urologic Diseases"},{"abstract_text":"ABSTRACT\nSmall cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is one of the most intractable human cancers to cure. It is an aggressive tumor\ncharacterized by rapid growth, metastatic progression, and initial response followed by almost invariable\nresistance to therapy. Studies to date have not resolved the extent that diverse genetic and epigenetic programs\ndrive SCLC and contribute to its lethality. We combined one of the largest and most diverse inventories of\npatient-derived xenograft models of SCLC globally with an ex vivo culture system that maintains\ntranscriptional fidelity with matched primary SCLC tumor to identify distinct and dynamic phenotypic states that\ndiffer in functional attributes within individual tumors. We show that human SCLC tumors display distinctive\nequilibria in the proportion of cells in various phenotypic (not merely transcriptional) states. We also show that\nSCLC states are highly regulated by multivalent cellular plasticity and we measure the kinetics of this plasticity\nat the single cell level. Importantly, standard of care chemotherapies in this disease preferentially kill specific\ncancer cell states. In this proposal, we posit that understanding the facets of SCLC's intratumoral heterogeneity\nwill: 1) contribute to our understanding of a poorly characterized aspect of cancer heterogeneity; 2) reveal how\nstochasticity and/or ecological cues in single-cell behaviors promote phenotypic equilibrium in cancer\npopulations; 3) provide insight into the biological and clinical behavior of SCLC; and 4) advance desperately\nneeded new therapeutic strategies of epigenetic reprogramming in this recalcitrant disease.

If successful, the characterization of malignant cell ontogenic programs (SA1), their plasticity\n(SA2), and the advancement of new therapies designed to combat plasticity by epigenetic reprogramming (SA3)\nwill advance a unique scientific canvas for the study of this highly lethal disease.","project_title":"Cellular plasticity gives rise to phenotypic equilibrium in small cell lung carcinoma","spending_categories_desc":"Biotechnology; Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Human Genome; Lung; Lung Cancer; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases"},{"abstract_text":"ABSTRACT\nThere is an urgent need to nominate biomarkers that are likely to predict the efficacy of radiotherapy and\naccelerate their clinical translation. Efforts thus far have been limited in large part because the genetic features\nregulating tumor cell survival and their frequency across and within individual cancer types had not been studied\non a large-scale. Our group completed the largest profiling effort of survival after radiation in cancer cell lines,\ncomprising a diverse collection of 533 genetically annotated tumor cell lines from 26 cancer types. To\ncomplement this work, we recently initiated the systematic profiling of >1000 genetic variants that could\npotentially contribute to the resistance of cancer cells to radiation. We combined results from our profiling efforts\nto identify features that predict the resistance of lung cancer cells to radiation. The objective in this investigation\nis to advance the clinical translation of two of the most important regulators of radiation resistance in lung cancer,\nNrf2 and Braf. The Nrf2 pathway is genetically altered in ~28% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer\n(NSCLC) and cells with mutations in NFE2L2 or KEAP1 are the most highly correlated with resistance to\nradiation. To identify genetic dependencies of Nrf2-active tumors, we used computational and experimental\napproaches to demonstrate the frequent co-occurrence between Nrf2 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)\nalteration in NSCLCs. Using genetic and chemical means we show that antagonizing the catalytic subunit of\nPI3K, p110 (encoded by PIK3CA), decreases Nrf2 activity and reverses radiation resistance driven by this\npathway. These results provide the rationale to advance a radiosensitization strategy for patients with Nrf2-active\nNSCLC by targeting PI3K. Our profiling efforts also demonstrate a critical role for BRAF, which is genetically\naltered in ~7% of patients with NSCLC, in the resistance of lung cancer cells to radiation. We show, for the first\ntime, that BRAF kinase domain mutations confer resistance to radiation in lung cancers and that they, unlike\nNrf2 pathway alterations, are almost invariably a minor component of the tumor (i.e. they are subclonal). We use\nmathematical and experimental models to show that clonal architecture has significant implications for the\nlikelihood of response to targeted therapies and radiation. Together, these results provide a compelling rationale\nto examine the role of Nrf2 and Braf alterations in predicting outcomes after radiotherapy and advance a\ngenomically-guided radiosensitization strategy for patients with these tumors. If these hypotheses are correct,\nour results will demonstrate that radiotherapeutic sensitizers can be selected based on both the identity and type\n(clonal v. subclonal) of genetic alterations identified in a patient's cancer, prompting an evolution in the use of\nradiation from a generic approach to one that is guided by the genetic composition of individual tumors.","project_title":"A biomarker-driven strategy to guide the use of radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer","spending_categories_desc":"Biotechnology; Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Human Genome; Lung; Lung Cancer; Precision Medicine; Radiation Oncology"},{"abstract_text":"Project Summary\nMammalian cells have evolved multiple non-overlapping mechanisms to ensure that DNA replication initiates\nfrom origins of replications once and only once in each division cycle; loss of control over these mechanisms\ninduces genomic instability, an important driver of malignant transformation. Increasing evidence suggests that\norigin utilization and activation in higher eukaryotes is influenced by epigenetic factors, but exact mechanisms\nare largely undefined. Our long-term goals are to elucidate the underpinning mechanisms that control replication\ninitiation in mammalian cells and to understand how perturbations of these mechanisms provokes genomic\ninstability. The histone methyltransferase SET8 is emerging as a key regulator of replication initiation in\nmammalian cells through its mono-methyltransferase activity on histone H4K20. The cell cycle regulated enzyme\nis essential for origin licensing in G1 phase of the cell cycle, but is proteolytically degraded in S-phase; blocking\nthis step triggers reiterative replication initiation within the same cell cycle or re-replication. Both SET8 and\nH4K20me, however, are also involved in transcriptional repression and in the repair of DNA double strand breaks\n(DSBs), but whether these seemingly independent activities play a role in replication initiation or re-replication is\nnot known. Most importantly, little to nothing is known about the nature or characteristics of the re-replication\nproducts that accumulate in cells with defective SET8 degradation, nor is there information on where in the\ngenome re-replication occurs or if certain genomic regions are more prone to re-replication induction. Our new\nresults show that re-replication resulting from defective SET8 degradation is not a stochastic process, with few\ngenomic sites exhibit large and significant copy number gains, reminiscent of genomic amplifications that are\nseen in cancer cells. Additional preliminary studies suggest that re-replication may originate from DNA double\nstrand breaks (DSBs) that may spontaneously arise during replication, and requires the activity of genes involved\nboth in transcriptional silencing and in DSB repair. Our innovative preliminary studies and experimental\napproaches are designed to thoroughly examine this alternative model of re-replication induction. In Aim 1, we\nwill determine the magnitude (copy number gains) and genomic distribution of the re-replicated DNA in bulk and\nsingle cells with defective SET8 degradation and following the induction of DSBs at defined genomic sites. We\nwill also test if these parameters vary in different cancer cell types and in cancer vs. non-cancer cells. In Aim 2,\nwe will define the roles of histone H4K20 methylation, transcriptional silencing by the H4K20me reader\nL3MBTL1, and proteins involved in the repair of DSBs in effecting re-replication. The successful execution of the\nproposed aims promises to increase our understanding of the mechanisms regulating replication initiation in\nmammalian cells, and lead to a better understanding of how perturbations of these mechanisms provokes\ngenomic instability.","project_title":"Regulation of re-replication in mammalian cells","spending_categories_desc":"Biotechnology; Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Human Genome"},{"abstract_text":"The long-term goal of the PI’s research program is to understand how RNAs exert their regulatory effects through\ninteraction with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and identify the basis for their therapeutic effects in human diseases.\nRBPs interact with RNAs to form ribonucleoprotein complexes that that control the fate of nearly every transcript.\nThese roles are essential for normal human physiology, as defects in RBP function are implicated in autoimmunity,\nneurodegeneration, cancer, and innate antiviral immune response.\nThe molecular mechanisms of RNA-protein\ninteractions (RPIs) that underpin gene expression and form the basis of numerous human diseases remain\nobscure. Consequently, RBPs are rapidly emerging as promising targets for the development of chemical probes\nand candidate therapeutic agents.

Preliminary findings from the PI\ndemonstrate that phloroglucinol meroterpenoid natural products modulate RPIs through reversible-covalent\nmodification of RNA-binding lysines in RBPs. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that high occurrence of\nreactive lysines at the RPI interface may provide an unprecedented opportunity in the development of precision\nchemical tools with specificity for RBPs and on-target potency gained through reversible-covalent modification.\n The proposed research program embodies three integrated projects that address specific challenges in\ntargeting RBPs in human cells. First, the lack of traditional enzymatic pockets or functional epitopes renders RBPs\nas canonically intractable targets. This proposal aims to overcome this challenge through reversible-covalent\nmodification of RNA-binding lysines at the RPI interface using phloroglucinol meroterpenoids. Second, the full\ncomplement of lysines with heightened reactivity at the RPI interface remains unexplored. This proposal aims to\novercome this limitation by using innovative chemoproteomic methods to globally map lysine reactivity and\nligandability directly in human cells. Last, the functional consequences of meroterpenoid-lysine interactions remain\nobscure. By leveraging integrative RNA pulldown and extraction methods with RNA-interactome capture and\nimmunofluorescence imaging, the proposal aims to identify advanced tool compounds that perturb RPIs through\nsite-selective modification of lysines in RBPs.
