Structural investigations of coronavirus spike protein,Structural investigations of coronavirus spike protein,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The spike (S) protein decorates the surface of coronavirus (CoV) particles such as SARS-CoV-2 and enables
CoV's to enter and infect host cells. The S protein is the immunogen in genetic and subunit vaccines against
COVID-19, which were critical in controlling the COVID-19 global pandemic. In cells that are infected with CoV's
or have received a genetic vaccine, the S protein is synthesized in the mammalian cell endoplasmic reticulum
(ER), and then trafficking via the secretory pathway consisting of ER, Golgi network, and plasma membrane
(PM). This secretory trafficking of S is bidirectional between ER and Golgi, which are the secretory organelles
that provide the enzymatic machinery for post-translational modifications, remodeling, and maturation. This
includes enzymes for N-glycosylation, which modulates S folding, viral entry, and interactions with the host
immune system. Structure-function investigations have shown that N-glycans modulate conformations of S
domains, such as the immunogenic receptor binding domain (RBD). Therefore, S N-glycans play a direct role in
immune response modulation. As such, N-glycan maturation changes in S due to tissue-, population-, ethnicity-
, and age-specific differences in biosynthetic machinery have the potential to dramatically alter infection CoV
outcomes and genetic vaccine immunogenicity. Yet little is known about the atomic-level consequences of N-
glycan maturation on S structure-function. This is mainly due to the inability to arrest S in various stages of
trafficking and N-glycan maturation. In this grant application, we will use an innovative new methodology to
control S trafficking. Purified samples of these novel S constructs will be structurally characterized using latest
cryoEM and computational tools and assayed for interactions with highly potent conformation-sensitive
antibodies. This will generate unprecedented and the first insights into structural modulation of S conformations
and epitopes by N-glycan maturation. Collectively, these investigations will be highly significant in providing
fundamental insights into secretory trafficking and the role of bidirectional trafficking of S in modulating N-glycan
maturation and RBD conformations. These data will open avenues for the design of a new generation of S-based
vaccines with improved immunogenicity. In the future, the insights from this research will serve as a platform to
inform the design of vaccines against enveloped viruses that pose global health challenges such as HIV and
influenza, which utilize the host cell ER-Golgi-PM secretory pathway to acquire immunity evading glycans.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><2019-nCoV S protein><2019-nCoV

Enhancing the antiviral memory B cell response,Enhancing the antiviral memory B cell response,"Project Summary/Abstract:
There is an urgent need to develop new approaches to induce broadly protective immunity against rapidly
mutating viruses. The induction of protective immunity requires the development of memory lymphocytes that
can rapidly recognize and neutralize the virus upon re-infection. Virus-specific memory B cells are long-lived
cells that are critical for the establishment of protective immunity by vaccines. Memory B cells mediate
protective immunity by rapidly differentiating into antibody secreting cells upon antigen re-encounter. Memory
B cells that re-encounter antigen can also undergo further mutation of their B cell receptor to increase their
affinity for viral antigen. Induction of broadly reactive memory B cells through iterative exposure to cross-
reactive viral antigens is an emerging vaccination strategy designed to protect against rapidly mutating viruses.
However, efforts to induce broadly reactive memory B cells have been hindered by the relative inefficiency with
which memory B cells diversify their B cell receptor following antigen re-encounter. Better understanding of the
mechanisms governing memory B cell development is necessary to facilitate the design of vaccines capable of
eliciting a broadly protective memory B cell response.
Additionally, effective harnessing of memory B cells to protect against mucosal viruses requires understanding
how memory B cells develop and function in barrier tissues. Memory cells are critical for the establishment of
barrier immunity, with lung-resident memory B cells recently identified as essential to elicit a rapid and robust
local antibody response following influenza challenge. However, a lack of clarity regarding the pathways
regulating memory B cells development in barrier tissues remains a significant barrier to designing vaccines
capable of inducing tissue-resident memory B cells.
This project proposes to characterize how the tissue microenvironment shapes the development of memory B
cells following viral infection. This project will first determine how viral- and tissue-specific cues influence the
transcriptional profile of memory B cells. This proposal will then identify key transcriptional regulators of
memory B cell development in barrier tissues and investigate the mechanisms by which these regulators
function. Transcriptional regulators are essential in facilitating memory lymphocyte development and function in
barrier tissues. By revealing the developmental pathway of memory B cells in barrier tissues, this study will
provide important insight into how vaccines can overcome existing challenges in order to elicit broadly
protective immunity against mucosal viruses. The development of vaccines specifically designed to induce
tissue-resident memory B cells would mark an important paradigm shift away from traditional vaccination
approaches focused on inducing a systemic virus-specific B cell response.",<Affinity><Antibody Response><Antibody-Secreting Cells><Antigens><B blood cells><B cell><B cell receptor><B cells><B-Cell Antigen Receptor><B-Cell Development><B-Cells><B-Lymphocytes><B-cell><Body Tissues><COVID crisis><COVID epidemic><COVID pandemic><COVID-19 crisis><COVID-19 epidemic><COVID-19 era><COVID-19 global health crisis><COVID-19 global pandemic><COVID-19 health crisis><COVID-19 pandemic><COVID-19 period><COVID-19 public health crisis><COVID-19 years><Cell Body><Cells><Cues><Development><Exposure to><Expression Signature><Gene Expression Profile><Gene Transcription><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic Transcription><Genetic defect><Grippe><Immunity><Immunoglobulin-Secreting Cells><Infection><Influenza><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Lymphatic cell><Lymphocyte><Lymphocytic><Mediating><Memory><Memory B Cell><Memory B-Lymphocyte><Mucosa><Mucosal Tissue><Mucous Membrane><Mutate><Mutation><Pathway interactions><RNA Expression><Risk><SARS-CoV-2 epidemic><SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis><SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic><SARS-CoV-2 pandemic><SARS-coronavirus-2 epidemic><SARS-coronavirus-2 pandemic><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 epidemic><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 pandemic><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic><Shapes><Source><Tissues><Transcription><Vaccination><Vaccine Design><Vaccines><Viral><Viral Antigens><Viral Diseases><Virus><Virus Diseases><coronavirus disease 2019 crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic><coronavirus disease 2019 global health crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic><coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic><coronavirus disease 2019 public health crisis><coronavirus disease crisis><coronavirus disease epidemic><coronavirus disease pandemic><coronavirus disease-19 global pandemic><coronavirus disease-19 pandemic><cross reactivity><design><designing><develop a vaccine><develop vaccines><development of a vaccine><developmental><future pandemic><gene expression pattern><gene expression signature><genome mutation><immunization strategy><immunogen><insight><lymph cell><new approaches><next pandemic><novel><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><pathway><pulmonary><response><severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global health crisis><severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic><transcriptional profile><transcriptional signature><vaccination strategy><vaccine development><viral infection><virus antigen><virus infection><virus-induced disease>,Biotechnology; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Vaccine Related
Community - based behavioral intervention to increase COVID - 19 and influenza vaccination for African American/ Black and Latino persons: An optimization randomized controlled trial,Community - based behavioral intervention to increase COVID - 19 and influenza vaccination for African American/ Black and Latino persons: An optimization randomized controlled trial,"PROJECT SUMMARY. The proposed study responds to NOT-MD-23-008, which calls for community-engaged
interventions to increase vaccine uptake among populations experiencing health disparities. We focus on
COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, both of which now require annual vaccines. Among those at highest risk
for morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality are African American/Black and Latino (ABBL) persons who are not
up-to-date on these vaccinations. Only 20-28% of adult AABL persons are up-to-date on COVID-19
vaccination, compared to 31% of White persons, and
only 30-40% of AABL persons receive the influenza
vaccine annually compared to >55% among White persons. AABL experience serious impediments to COVID-
19 (and to a lesser extent, influenza) vaccination at individual- (e.g., distrust, insufficient knowledge, low
perceived risk, cognitive biases), social- (e.g., peer norms), and structural-levels of influence (e.g., poor
access). Taken together, these comprise multi-level vaccine hesitancy. Factors that promote vaccination
include trusted AABL health educators (peers, nurses), tapping into altruism and collective responsibility,
circumventing cognitive biases, and reducing structural barriers. Without efforts to address multi-level vaccine
hesitancy, rates of COVID-19 and influenza vaccination will remain unacceptably low and racial/ethnic health
disparities in infectious disease morbidity and mortality will persist. The proposed study is led by a collaborative
team at New York University and the Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation. It uses the multiphase
optimization strategy (MOST), an engineering-inspired framework, to test effects of individual candidate
intervention components in a factorial design and then optimize a multi-component intervention made up of the
most cost-effective combination of components. Staying up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccination (confirmed with
documentary evidence) is the primary outcome, and influenza vaccination is the secondary outcome. We have
identified four promising candidate components, with an emphasis on brevity, low-touch, and future scalability:
A) nurse-led shared decision making, B) a text message intervention, C) modest lottery prizes for vaccination,
and D) peer navigation to vaccination appointments. Participants will be N=560 community-residing adult
English and Spanish-speaking AABL persons who are not up-to-date on COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations
but with at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. Specific aims are: Aim 1) identify which of four components
contribute meaningfully to improvement in the outcomes; Aim 2) identify mediators (e.g., altruism, norms) and
moderators (e.g., sociodemographic characteristics, distrust) of the effects of each component; and Aim 3)
build the most cost-effective intervention package(s). Participants will be randomly assigned to an experimental
condition, and assessed at 3- and 6-months post-baseline; N=45 participants will engage in qualitative in-depth
interviews. We will also uncover, describe, and plan for implementation issues so the optimized intervention
can be rapidly scaled up by community-based and outpatient health organizations.","<2019-nCoV vaccine><21+ years old><Address><Adult><Adult Human><African American><Afro

Factors Influencing Pediatric Asthma into Adulthood (FIPA2),Factors Influencing Pediatric Asthma into Adulthood (FIPA2),"A. Summary of Funded Parent Grant:
Factors Influencing Pediatric Asthma into Adulthood (R01MD019027)
The prevalence of asthma among American Indian (AI) children is 9.3% as compared to 5.5% in non- Hispanic
White children. Asthma disparities become even more pronounced into adulthood, with AI adults having the
highest prevalence of asthma as compared to all other racial/ethnic groups in the US, with 60% uncontrolled.
Asthma is influenced by social and environmental factors (SEF) including adverse childhood events (ACEs),
tobacco smoke, and everyday life stressors that may alter immunological state. ACEs in particular, including
abuse, neglect, and household challenges have been associated with immune dysregulation, may have
implications for clinical outcomes of respiratory viral infections in children that have been linked to asthma and
persistent respiratory symptoms. For example, Infants who develop severe RSV bronchiolitis in the first year of
life are more likely to develop asthma, and children with asthma are at increased risk of experiencing
complications from respiratory viral infections due to SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza,
and rhinovirus C. In the Factors Influencing Pediatric Asthma (FIPA) study including children from a Northern
Plains American Indian community, we found children with asthma experienced an increased clinical burden
from RSV infection and had lower levels of serum RSV-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) than children without
asthma, indicative of immune suppression or dysfunction. However, the complex interplay between social,
environmental and immunological response to viral respiratory infections remains largely unknown, and these
factors have not been investigated among AI children with respect to their influence on immunological
response and asthma development and control of asthma symptoms. In this continued AI community-focused
study, we will test the hypothesis that social and environmental factors contribute to asthma susceptibility
through stress-induced immune dysregulation, including the alteration of immunological response to viral
respiratory infections. We will also investigate the role of viral respiratory infections and SEF on asthma
control, including frequency of symptoms, exacerbations, ER visits/hospitalizations, and use of asthma
medications.
 Aim 1: Identify social and environmental factors (SEF) that contribute to asthma susceptibility,
asthma control, and long-term respiratory health in American Indian children. We will follow-up on our
previously NIMHD-funded case/control study of 324 children recruited between the ages of 6-17 from 2013-
2017 as they transition into adulthood (now ages 11-27). We will recontact original study participants,
evaluating their current asthma status to investigate the role of age and gender on long-term respiratory health
including current asthma and asthma control. We will also expand our study to 400 new participants with and
without asthma between the ages of 6-17, including Tribal members living in Rapid City, SD, and offspring of
original study participants (~30% of original study participants have since become parents). We will obtain
detailed measures of SEF, and retrospective information on adverse childhood events (ACE) using an
established screener to evaluate their role in asthma susceptibility and asthma control, including comparisons
between urban vs. rural and multi-generational effects in this community-engaged study. We hypothesize that
domains of biological and behavioral influences acting on the individual and interpersonal levels generate
social stress and have an impact on asthma development and control.
 Aim 2: Investigate the role of SEF on immunological response to viral respiratory infections
(VRIs) in AI children with and without asthma. We will investigate the impact of social and environmental
factors measured using validated and Tribally-developed surveys on the immune system of AI children with
and without asthma, including response to viral respiratory infections (viral-specific serum IgG and IgM
concentrations to RSV and other VRI pathogens known to cause long-term respiratory sequelae). We will
quantify serological measurements of participants’ humoral immune responses including serum biomarkers of
inflammation (Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines), atopy (serum total IgE), and total immunoglobulins. We will test our
hypothesis that interactions with detailed survey measures of SEF with immunological and clinical outcomes of
VRIs, including viral responses in participants with and without asthma are the strongest and most significant
predictors in our AI participants.
 Aim 3: Engage with an existing Tribal Community Advisory Board (CAB) using continuous
bidirectional process evaluation to develop an intervention and policy framework of asthma
prevention. We will engage with the CRST’s dedicated community and Tribal cultural experts and active
volunteers in building our local CAB. We will leverage the scientific knowledge gained under this proposal to
work with the CAB to create a sustainable, feasible, and Lakota-driven, intervention and policy framework,
including the creation of structures to allow integration of social stressers including ACEs into existing referral
services and policy initiatives. We will collect detailed information using questionnaires and semi-structured
interviews among CAB members and the community about the study development and processes. We
recognize that Tribal children with mild, moderate to severe asthma who are experiencing humoral immune
response alterations and a combination of SEFs need very targeted and specialized preventive measures that
this study will be able to develop and support with implementation.
B. RESEARCH PLAN: Environmental Toxicants and Asthma in American Indian Children
Background: Viral respiratory infections in early life have been linked to the development of asthma and
persistent respiratory symptoms in children 1–3, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) of which the majority
of children are exposed before age 2. Infants who develop RSV bronchiolitis in the first year of life have a high
chance of developing asthma 4, and children with asthma have an increased risk of experiencing complications
and lasting respiratory symptoms from infections such as RSV, SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and rhinovirus-C 5–8.
The prevalence of asthma among American Indian (AI) children is 9.3% as compared to 5.5% in non-Hispanic
White children 9. This is a serious but understudied, pediatric health disparity in the U.S. that becomes even
more pronounced into adulthood, with AI adults having the highest prevalence of asthma as compared to all
other racial/ethnic groups 9. Asthma has been linked to a number of social and environmental factors 10–15
including exposure to social stress, tobacco smoke, air pollution, and environmental toxicants including per-
and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) 16. There is mounting evidence that PFAS, a “forever chemical” in the
environment has a deleterious effect on many aspects of health 17, including thyroid and immune activity 18,
inflammation in pregnancy 19, fetal growth 20, immune response to childhood vaccines 21 and viral respiratory
infections 22,23. Thus, exposure to PFAS and environmental toxins during childhood may have a lasting effect
on Tribal health. In summary, we propose to address newly emerging chemical exposures including PFAS in
an at-risk, low income, Native American community in consultation with the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe
(CRST), including children living in Rapid City South Dakota and the Cheyenne River Sioux and Oglala Lakota
Reservations. In this area of South Dakota, the proportion of children living below the Federal poverty line is
47% and 57% in Ziebach 24 and Dewey 25 Counties, respectively. The adverse health effects of PFAS and
environmental toxins due to community-level exposure in this area of high childhood poverty has yet to be
investigated, nor their effects on immunological response to viral respiratory infections and immune
dysfunction.
Preliminary Research: In the Factors Influencing Pediatric Asthma (FIPA) study we found that AI children
with asthma living on the Cheyenne River Sioux and Oglala Lakota Reservations were more likely to reside in
multi-unit housing, and in residences with rodent or insect infestation resulting in poor indoor air quality as
compared to asthma controls 26. Children with asthma also had higher BMI, total leukocyte counts, %
eosinophils, total serum IgE, and specific IgE to five common indoor airborne antigens 27. We also found
children with asthma to have lower levels of RSV-specific IgG during the winter (Figure 1) and to report
increased hospitalizations and RSV diagnoses (Figure 2), suggesting immune dysregulation with clinical
implications 28. We hypothesize that exposures to environmental toxins, some of which have been linked to
immune dysregulation may play an important role.
Figure 1: A. Asthma cases recruited during the winter (RSV season) had significantly lower RSV IgG as compared to asthma cases
recruited during the summer (p=2.5x10-6). There was no observed difference in seasonality for asthma controls (p=0.60).
B. More children with asthma have low levels of IgG (<40 IU/mL).
In unpublished results, Dr. Erdei (co-PI of parent
study) detected PFAS in 83% of samples from 50
CRST adults who fish regularly from the Tribe's
main public water sources. She has identified an
association between PFAS and a number of tissue-
specific and antinuclear autoantibodies, and found
serum PFAS and other compounds to be predictors
of autoimmune markers indicative of a
hyperreactive immune response in adults (Figure
3). Consuming locally caught fish as part of AI Figure 2: Children with asthma in the FIPA study report a higher
culture and as a dietary source of protein was also clinical burden from RSV.
associated with overall elevation of serum PFAS.
Similar investigations among children in the CRST
will allow us to learn more about PFAS exposure patterns as it relates to immune dysregulation, viral respiratory
infections, and its effect on children’s health in the community.
Figure 3: Quantile Regression plots in CRST adults showing that A. Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposures are predictive of anti-
native DNA response. B. PFOS and C. PFOA exposures are predictive of thyroid-specific (anti-thyroglobulin) autoimmune response,
with PFOA having an immunosuppressive effect.
In summary, we hypothesize that exposure to environmental toxins, specifically PFAS, contributes to immune
dysregulation and response to viral respiratory infections in American Indian children with asthma. As
recruitment for FIPA2 is starting, this is an opportune time for Dr. Spear to lead a study investigating the role
of PFAS and environmental toxins on the health of AI children. This opportunity will afford Dr. Spear to narrow
in on the role of PFAS on immune dysregulation and response to viral respiratory infections in children with
and without asthma, while making new connections with scientists in the field of environmental research.
Overall, our study will advance knowledge of the effect of environmental toxins on immune dysregulation of
children to inform future policies and interventions.
Thus, our specific aims for this diversity supplement are:
Specific Aim 1: Measure and identify suspect and PFAS chemicals that are present in American Indian
children from Rapid City and the Cheyenne River Sioux/Oglala Lakota Reservations.
Specific Aim 2: Perform correlative and predictive modeling between PFAS/suspect chemicals and
immunological biomarkers and response to viral respiratory infections in AI children with and without
asthma.
Approach: We will perform suspect screening and test for levels of 12 PFAS in serum samples of 52 children
with and without asthma and living in urban vs. rural (Reservation) locations (Figure 4). We will identify suspect
chemicals present in AI children, and perform preliminary correlations with immune biomarkers, viral-specific
immunoglobulins, PFAS and suspect chemicals identified. Characterizing the presence and effect of
environmental toxins on the immune system is an essential step for understanding environmental health
disparities, which the community has been struggling with for decades.
Figure 4: Location and summary of serum samples for study to measure PFAS/suspect chemicals in children ages 6-17 years old in
FIPA2. Recruitment is beginning 5/2024. We also have stored samples for >300 original FIPA participants at -80C (living on
Reservation, only).
Specific Aim 1: Measure and identify suspect and PFAS chemicals that are present in American Indian
children from Rapid City and the Cheyenne River Sioux/Oglala Lakota Reservations. We will work with
the UCSF Bioassay Facility Core to develop a protocol for PFAS and untargeted suspect screening of serum
samples from 52 AI children, including 26 asthma cases and 26 matched controls living in an urban (Rapid City
SD) vs. rural (Reservation) environment.
Specific Aim 2: Perform correlative and predictive modeling between PFAS/suspect chemicals and
immunological biomarkers and response to viral respiratory infections in AI children with and without
asthma. We will test for a correlation of PFAS/suspect chemicals with levels of immune biomarkers and viral-
specific immunoglobulins. Immune biomarkers will include cytokines, Creactive protein, CBCs (white blood cell
counts), total serum IgE, and viral specific IgG/IgM (SARs-CoV2, RSV, influenza, and rhinovirus C). Results
from this aim will provide insights in to 1) the variability in exposure to environmental toxicants in children living
in urban vs. rural (Reservation) locations and 2) the role of exposure to PFAS/suspect chemicals on immune
dysregulation and asthma.
Statistical analyses: We will examine the distribution of individual PFAS chemicals plus untargeted suspect
chemicals to determine the relevant statistical test. In general, for commonly detected chemicals we will utilize
linear and logistic regression models (or nonparametric tests) to test for associations between PFAS/suspect
chemicals adjusting for multiple covariates selected through an iterative process (e.g. BMI, sex, household
size, asthma medications); we will also contrast models with and without an asthma interaction. For rare
chemicals we will apply a fisher’s exact test for detected/undetected. ROC curves will be generated for
individual chemicals by asthma and location, and cluster analyses will be performed over all chemicals using a
principal component analysis (with UMAP projection) and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)
for predictive modeling and Cox regression. Lastly, we will attempt a mediation analysis to evaluate if exposure
to PFAS/suspect chemicals contributes to asthma via immune dysregulation.
Relevance to the parent grant: The parent grant is centered on identifying social determinants of the
environment including adverse childhood experiences that contribute to the development of asthma through
altering the immunological response to viral respiratory infections. However, there is substantial evidence to
suggest that exposure to environmental toxicants contribute to immune dysregulation in both the context of
asthma and general immune function as discussed above. In this proposal, Dr. Spear will focus on the physical
environment, specifically the role of exposure and accumulation of environmental toxicants on immune
dysregulation in children with and without asthma.",<0-11 years old><17 year old><17 years of age><19S Gamma Globulin><2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><21+ years old><7S

Understanding multilevel predictors affecting family formation among sexual and gender minority couples,Understanding multilevel predictors affecting family formation among sexual and gender minority couples,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Family formation plans (e.g., whether/when to have children) vary by micro-level factors like
sociodemographics (age, race/ethnicity) and individual- and couple-level influences like finances and job
security. These micro-level influences do not fully account for variations in reproductive life plans, which are
also influenced by macro-level factors like state and local laws and structural inequities. Sexual and gender
minority (SGM) people's health and wellbeing may be particularly affected by these macro-level factors. Our
research and that of others demonstrate that structural stigma (macro-social conditions like anti-LGBT
legislation that negatively impact wellbeing) worsens SGM people's mental and physical health. Given current
high levels of structural stigma in the US, there is an urgent need to understand the potential health and
wellbeing impacts to halt the widening of already gaping health disparities. One aspect of health and wellbeing
potentially impacted by anti-LGBT legislation and other forms of structural stigma is having children. Almost
40% of SGM people are interested in parenting but may face unique barriers in doing so. Being unable to
freely plan when, whether, and how to have children excludes SGM people from a health-promoting life stage,
which may drive some SGM-related health disparities (e.g., alcohol use, cardiovascular health, depression).
The proposed mixed-methods study will prospectively examine multi-level impacts on SGM couples' family
formation plans. Aim 1. Quantitatively test multi-level influences on family formation plans through a large-scale
survey of SGM couples. We hypothesize that couples living in states with higher levels of structural stigma will
be less likely to plan to have children and more likely to report that state-level policies influence their decision-
making. These associations will be moderated by the racial/ethnic and gender composition of the couple, as
well as by SES. Aim 2. Qualitatively describe multi-level factors influencing SGM couples' family formation
planning. From the Aim 1 sample, we will recruit couples from states with high and low structural stigma for in-
depth dyadic interviews (N=120). We will describe multi-level influences on family formation planning. Aim 3.
Given the dynamic sociopolitical landscape for marginalized populations, we will quantify changes in impacts of
multi-level factors on family formation plans and well-being over time. We will follow the Aim 2 subsample with
dyadic pulse surveys (i.e., brief/regular surveys across three years) and a final in-depth dyadic interview. Using
qualitative trajectory methods and prospective analyses of dyadic pulse surveys, we will test our hypotheses
that changes (or lack thereof) in couples' contexts (e.g., moving to another state, legislation changes) will
influence decision-making, mental health, relationship quality, and family formation. This project will produce
the first investigation of how multi-level factors prospectively influence SGM couples' family formation plans.
This work will have a positive impact by revealing for the first time the multi-level needs of LGBTQ couples as
they form families, thereby informing interventions to reduce entrenched inequities.",<0-11 years old><1918 H1N1><1918 influenza A virus><1918 influenza H1N1 virus><1918 influenza virus><Address><Adoption><Affect><Age><Alcohol Drinking><Alcohol abuse><Alcohol consumption><Area><Automobile Driving><COVID crisis><COVID epidemic><COVID pandemic><COVID-19 crisis><COVID-19 epidemic><COVID-19 era><COVID-19 global health crisis><COVID-19 global pandemic><COVID-19 health crisis><COVID-19 pandemic><COVID-19 period><COVID-19 public health crisis><COVID-19 years><Cardiovascular Diseases><Child><Child Rearing><Child Youth><Children (0-21)><Climate><Complex><Couples><Decision Making><Disparities><Disparity><Economic Factors><Economical Factors><EtOH abuse><EtOH drinking><EtOH use><Ethnic Origin><Ethnicity><Exclusion><Face><Family><Family Health><Family health status><Fertility Rates><Fostering><Gender><Gender and Sexual Minorities><Geography><Gestation><Goals><Health><Health Promotion><Heterosexuals><Individual><Inequity><Institution><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Interview><Investigation><Jobs><Knowledge><LGBT><LGBTQ><Laws><Legislation><Lesbian Gay Bi-sexual Transgender><Lesbian Gay Bi-sexual Transgender Queer><Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender><Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer><Life><Literature><Mental Depression><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Meteorological Climate><Methods><NICHD><NIH><National Institute of Child Health and Human Development><National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development><National Institutes of Health><Natural experiment><Occupations><Parenting><Parenting behavior><Parents><Personal Satisfaction><Persons><Physiologic pulse><Policies><Politics><Pregnancy><Process><Professional Positions><Psychological Health><Public Health><Public Opinion><Pulse><Race><Races><Reporting><Reproductive Technology><Research><Research Resources><Resources><SARS-CoV-2 epidemic><SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis><SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic><SARS-CoV-2 pandemic><SARS-coronavirus-2 epidemic><SARS-coronavirus-2 pandemic><Salutogenesis><Sampling><Security><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 epidemic><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 pandemic><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic><Sexual and Gender Minorities><Social Conditions><Social Environment><Societal Conditions><Spanish flu><Spanish influenza><Statutes and Laws><Stress><Survey Instrument><Surveys><Testing><Time><United States National Institutes of Health><Variant><Variation><Woman><Work><ages><alcohol co-abuse><alcohol ingestion><alcohol intake><alcohol problem><alcohol product use><alcohol use><alcoholic beverage consumption><alcoholic drink intake><cardiovascular disorder><cardiovascular health><childrearing><cis-gender><cisgender><climatic><coronavirus disease 2019 crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic><coronavirus disease 2019 global health crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic><coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic><coronavirus disease 2019 public health crisis><coronavirus disease crisis><coronavirus disease epidemic><coronavirus disease pandemic><coronavirus disease-19 global pandemic><coronavirus disease-19 pandemic><depression><disparity in health><driving><ethanol abuse><ethanol consumption><ethanol drinking><ethanol ingestion><ethanol intake><ethanol product use><ethanol use><faces><facial><family influence><gender minority group><gender minority individual><gender minority people><gender minority population><hazardous alcohol use><health disparity><health disparity community><health disparity group><health disparity populations><improved><interest><interventional strategy><kids><marginalized group><marginalized individual><marginalized people><marginalized population><novel><parent><physical conditioning><physical health><prepregnancy><problem alcohol use><problem drinking><problematic alcohol consumption><problematic alcohol use><promoting health><prospective><racial><racial background><racial origin><recruit><reproductive><severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global health crisis><severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic><sexual minority group><sexual minority health><sexual minority individual><sexual minority people><sexual minority population><social><social climate><social context><social factors><social stigma><socio-demographics><sociodemographics><socioenvironment><socioenvironmental><stigma><stressor><well-being><wellbeing><youngster>,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Mental Health; Pediatric; Social Determinants of Health
CTO1681 to prevent and mitigate cytokine release syndrome in CAR T-cell recipients,CTO1681 to prevent and mitigate cytokine release syndrome in CAR T-cell recipients,"Abstract
CytoAgents is developing CTO1681 for the prevention and treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
associated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. CAR T-cell therapy has emerged as a very
promising treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) hematologic malignancies. However,
CAR T-cell therapy can also result in a high incidence of severe and potentially life-threatening immune-mediated
toxicity, including CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). CRS is a systemic
inflammatory response that has been reported as one of the most frequent and dangerous adverse events
following CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy. CRS is thought to be mediated by an initial release of
proinflammatory cytokines, which activate bystander immune cells and endothelial cells, which in turn activate
more immune cells, culminating in a cytokine storm. Because CytoAgents’ novel approach is focused on
reducing the transcription of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, its compound is expected to mitigate,
and in some cases even prevent, CRS. CTO1681 is an orally available, stable compound identical to beraprost
sodium-314d (BPS-314d), the stereoisomer of the racemate beraprost sodium (BPS) that accounts for nearly all
of BPS’s pharmacological activity. Because BPS can modulate the release of cytokines from human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells, CytoAgents has investigated the use of BPS and its active isomer CTO1681 as a
treatment for moderate virus-induced CRS, specifically influenza and COVID-19. All of the results to date indicate
that CTO1681 has strong potential to reduce the CRS response, leading to better patient outcomes regardless
of CRS etiology. Overall, BPS, BPS-314d, and CTO1681 formulations have been found to be well tolerated and
to not completely suppress cytokine levels in healthy volunteers with normal serum levels. CytoAgents is
currently expanding clinical investigation of CTO1681 to the treatment of CAR T-cell therapy-induced CRS.
CytoAgents’ Phase 1b trial of CTO1681, a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalating safety and pharmacokinetic
(PK) MAD study in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) receiving CD19-directed CAR T-cell
therapy, is scheduled to begin in the coming months. This Direct to Phase II project will support expansion to a
Phase 2a cohort once the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been determined. The company will
undertake three specific aims: 1) determining preliminary efficacy of CTO1681 in preventing or reducing CRS
or ICANS vs. historical or placebo treatment, 2) determining the expanded safety profile of CTO1681 in
patients with DLCBL receiving CAR T-cell therapy, and 3) investigating the potential impact of CTO1681 on
antitumor activity of CAR T-cell therapy compared to historical data and placebo. This project will help support
clinical assessment of CTO1681 in CAR T-cell therapy recipients, advancing a novel treatment with the
potential to reduce hospitalization, intensity of supportive care, and mortality and to improve patients’ quality
of life. Moreover, this therapeutic may allow more patients with R/R hematologic malignancies to have
access to potentially life-saving CAR T-cell treatment.",<Adverse Experience><Adverse event><Arterial Obstructive Diseases><Arterial Obstructive Disorder><Arterial Occlusive Diseases><Arterial Occlusive Disorder><Asian><Blood Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors><Blood Platelet Antiaggregants><Blood Serum><Blood Vessels><CAR T cell therapy><CAR T cells><CAR T therapy><CAR modified T cells><CAR-T><CAR-Ts><CD19><CD19 gene><COVID-19><CV-19><Causality><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cells><Chronic><Clinical Trials><Clinical assessments><Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019><Country><DLBCL><Dangerousness><Data><Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma><Dinoprostone><Dose><Double-Blind Method><Double-Blind Study><Double-Blinded><Double-Masked Method><Double-Masked Study><Drug Kinetics><Dysfunction><EP4><Endothelial Cells><Epididymal Secretory Protein E4><Epoprostenol><Etiology><Formulation><Functional disorder><Gene Transcription><Genetic Transcription><Grippe><HE4><Health Care Systems><Healthcare Systems><Hematologic Cancer><Hematologic Malignancies><Hematologic Neoplasms><Hematological Malignancies><Hematological Neoplasms><Hematological Tumor><Hematopoietic Cancer><History><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Human><ICANS><Immune><Immune response><Immunes><Immunological response><Incidence><Infection><Inflammatory><Influenza><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Isomerism><Letters><Life><Major Epididymis-Specific Protein E4><Malignant Hematologic Neoplasm><Marketing><Mediating><Modern Man><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Na element><Oral><PBMC><PG Analogs><PGE2><PGE2 alpha><PGE2alpha><PGI2><Patient outcome><Patient-Centered Outcomes><Patient-Focused Outcomes><Patients><Peripheral Angiopathies><Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell><Peripheral Vascular Diseases><Peripheral Vascular Disorder><Pharmaceutical Agent><Pharmaceuticals><Pharmacokinetics><Pharmacologic Substance><Pharmacological Substance><Phase><Phase 1b Trial><Phase Ib Trial><Physiopathology><Placebos><Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors><Platelet Antiaggregants><Platelet aggregation><Prevention><Prostacyclins><Prostaglandin Analogs><Prostaglandin E2><Prostaglandin E2 alpha><Prostaglandin E2alpha><Prostaglandin I2><Prostaglandins I><Putative Protease Inhibitor WAP5><QOL><Quality of life><RNA Expression><Receptor Protein><Recommendation><Recording of previous events><Refractory><Relapse><Reporting><SBIR><Safety><Schedule><Serum><Sham Treatment><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Sodium><Stereoisomer><Supportive Therapy><Supportive care><Synthetic Prostaglandins><T cells for CAR><T-Cell Receptor Therapy><T-Cell Receptor Treatment><T-Cell Receptor based Therapy><T-Cell Receptor based Treatment><TCR Therapy><TCR based Therapy><TCR based treatment><Therapeutic><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Transcription><Vasodilating Agent><Vasodilator Agents><Vasodilator Drugs><Vasodilators><Virus><WAP Four-Disulfide Core Domain Protein 2><WAP5><WFDC2><WFDC2 gene><Work><analog><biological signal transduction><causation><chimeric antigen T cell receptor><chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy><chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells><chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy><chimeric antigen receptor T cells><chimeric antigen receptor T therapy><chimeric antigen receptor fusion protein T-cells><chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells><clinical investigation><cohort><coronavirus disease 2019><coronavirus disease-19><coronavirus infectious disease-19><cytokine><cytokine release syndrome><cytokine storm><dJ461P17.6><disease causation><healthy volunteer><histories><host response><immune cell therapy associated neurologic toxicity><immune effector cell mediated neurotoxicity syndrome><immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity><immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome><immune system response><immunoresponse><improved><isomer><large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma><mortality><new approaches><novel><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><open label><open label study><pathophysiology><patient oriented outcomes><patient population><peripheral blood vessel disorder><pharmaceutical><pharmacologic><prevent><preventing><prostaglandin X><pulmonary arterial hypertension><pulmonary artery hypertension><randomized placebo controlled study><receptor><response><sham therapy><systemic inflammation><systemic inflammatory response><tumor><vascular>,Biotechnology; Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Gene Therapy; Gene Therapy Clinical Trials; Genetics; Hematology; Immunotherapy; Infectious Diseases; Lymphatic Research; Lymphoma; Orphan Drug; Prevention; Rare Diseases
Developing mRNAdesigner tool package for optimization of mRNA sequence,Developing mRNAdesigner tool package for optimization of mRNA sequence,"Abstract
The goal of this project is to develop a platform called mRNAdesigner, an integrated deep learning model to
optimize 5'UTR, codon usage, and 3'UTR at same time, which enables users to design the optimal mRNA
sequence to enhance protein expression level, thus to improve the mRNA translation efficiency
mRNA medicines have several beneficial features: safety, efficacy, production, and speed. It is a significant
challenge for all of the researchers to maximize the translation efficiency of mRNA vaccine. Multiple factors are
involved to regulate the stability and efficiency of mRNA, including 5' untranslated region (UTR), 3' UTR, codon
et al, and several in silico approaches have been developed to optimize these factors respectively However, as
these factors always function together during the translation of mRNA, and individual optimization is insufficient.
Thus, a novel integrated deep learning model for these factors is needed to comprehensively enhance the
stability and efficiency of mRNA medicine. We propose to develop a platform mRNAdesigner that will address
the challenges in design of mRNA sequence to enhance mRNA stability and translation efficiency, and thus
provide important information for the development and optimization of mRNA vaccines. mRNAdesigner includes
three components: mRNAbase, mRNAoptimizer, and mRNAviewer. mRNAbase is a database to collect high
translational efficiency gene data, the optimized mRNA sequence of ORF, 5' UTR and 3'UTR for any target
proteins, the energy, secondary structure, and functional annotation of those optimized mRNA sequence of ORF;
mRNAoptimizer, in silico deep learning optimization of mRNA sequence, provides a fast methodology to
investigate all possible integration of the ORF, 5' UTR and 3'UTR and identify the optimal mRNA sequence; and
mRNAviewer to visualize the optimized mRNA sequences, the secondary structures and the related functions.
Finally, the integrated models by designing the 5'UTR, codon, and 3'UTR sequence for representative will be
experimentally validate in vitro and in vivo. Software prototypes mRNAdesigner including mRNAbase,
mRNAoptimizer, and mRNAviewer will be made publicly available to the research community via a project
website at https:/ccsm.uth.edu/NSF-mRNAdesigner.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><2019-nCoV vaccine><3' Untranslated Regions><3'UTR><5' Untranslated

Understanding the OAS/RNase L pathway during pathogenic viral infections,Understanding the OAS/RNase L pathway during pathogenic viral infections,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Ribonuclease L (RNase L) is a key component of the mammalian innate antiviral response. For decades, RNase
L was presumed to reduce viral protein synthesis by cleaving ribosomes to arrest translation. However, we and others
recently demonstrated that RNase L-cleaved ribosomes are translation-competent, and that pathogenic viruses can
synthesize proteins despite activating RNase L. These observations have revealed a significant gap in knowledge
regarding how RNase L functions and how viruses evade it. We have demonstrated that RNase L rapidly degrades nearly
all cellular mRNAs upon activation. This activity regulates three cellular processes that have expanded our understanding
of RNase L and that have elucidated how pathogenic viruses evade and potentially hijack RNase L functions. First,
RNase L reprograms translation to an antiviral state by degrading constitutively expressed cellular mRNAs while
sparing host mRNAs encoding antiviral proteins (e.g., type I interferons), which permits antiviral protein synthesis.
Importantly, the mRNAs encoded by several pathogenic viruses (e.g., dengue virus) similarly evade RNase L-mediated
mRNA decay, thus permitting viral protein synthesis. This observation has elucidated how pathogenic viruses synthesize
proteins despite activating RNase L. This application proposes to characterize the RNase L-mediated mRNA decay
pathway and determine how host and viral mRNAs evade it. Second, RNase L activation triggers the inhibition of nuclear
mRNA export. This is a critical antiviral mechanism that antagonizes influenza A virus protein synthesis, but it also
downregulates the expression of host antiviral proteins (e.g., type I interferons). Importantly, pathogenic viruses (e.g.,
dengue virus) activate this RNase L-dependent pathway, resulting in sequestration of host antiviral mRNAs in the
nucleus. This observation suggests that viruses potentially hijack this function of RNase L to limit host antiviral protein
production. This application aims to determine how RNase L inhibits mRNA export, the breadth of viruses it antagonizes,
how it impacts host antiviral gene expression during pathogenic viral infections. Third, RNase L regulates the assembly
of cytoplasmic antiviral ribonucleoprotein complexes. Specifically, RNase L inhibits the assembly of stress granules and
promotes the assembly of an alternative stress granule-like ribonucleoprotein complex termed RNase L-dependent body.
RNase L-dependent bodies are the predominant antiviral granule assembled in response to SARS-CoV-2 or dengue virus
infection, yet their function is completely unknown. This application aims to determine the function of antiviral stress
granules and RNase L-dependent bodies and to determine how their regulation by RNase L alters the antiviral response.
Understanding the mechanisms and functions of these cellular processes will advance our understanding of the
OAS/RNase L pathway, innate immune antiviral gene induction, and virology. Moreover, it will promote general
medicine by broadly characterizing fundamental cellular, molecular, and RNA biology that is relevant to non-infectious
diseases, including autoimmune diseases, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Lastly, the proposed research will support the
development of promising antiviral, immunomodulatory, and anticancer therapies based on RNase L biology.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><Acceleration><Anti-viral Response><Autoimmune Diseases><Biology><Breakbone Fever Virus><COVID-19 virus><COVID19 virus><Cancer Treatment><Cancers><Cell Function><Cell Nucleus><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><CoV-2><CoV2><Complex><Cytoplasm><Cytoplasmic Granules><DENV><DENV infection><Dengue Infection><Dengue Virus><Dengue fever virus><Dengue virus infection><Development><Disease><Disorder><Gene Expression><Immune><Immunes><Immunomodulation><Influenza A><Influenza A virus><Influenza Viruses Type A><Influenzavirus A><Interferon Type I><Knowledge><Malignant Neoplasm Therapy><Malignant Neoplasm Treatment><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Mediating><Medicine><Messenger RNA><Molecular><Nerve Degeneration><Neuron Degeneration><Non-Polyadenylated RNA><Nuclear><Nucleus><Orthomyxovirus Type A><Pathogenicity><Pathway interactions><Process><Production><Protein Biosynthesis><RNA><RNA Gene Products><RNA Nucleases><RNase><Regulation><Research><Ribonuclease Family Protein><Ribonucleases><Ribonucleic Acid><Ribonucleoproteins><Ribosomal Peptide Biosynthesis><Ribosomal Protein Biosynthesis><Ribosomal Protein Synthesis><Ribosomes><SARS corona virus 2><SARS-CO-V2><SARS-COVID-2><SARS-CoV-2><SARS-CoV2><SARS-associated corona virus 2><SARS-associated coronavirus 2><SARS-coronavirus-2><SARS-related corona virus 2><SARS-related coronavirus 2><SARSCoV2><Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome CoV 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Corona Virus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus 2><Severe acute respiratory syndrome associated corona virus 2><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2><Severe acute respiratory syndrome related corona virus 2><Subcellular Process><Translations><Type A Influenza><Viral><Viral Diseases><Viral Gene Products><Viral Gene Proteins><Viral Genes><Viral Proteins><Virus><Virus Diseases><Wuhan coronavirus><anti-cancer therapy><autoimmune condition><autoimmune disorder><autoimmunity disease><cancer therapy><cancer-directed therapy><coronavirus disease 2019 virus><coronavirus disease-19 virus><dengue viral infection><developmental><gene induction><granule><hCoV19><immune modulation><immune regulation><immunologic reactivity control><immunomodulatory><immunoregulation><immunoregulatory><induction of genes><mRNA><mRNA Decay><mRNA Export><malignancy><nCoV2><neoplasm/cancer><neural degeneration><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neurological degeneration><neuronal degeneration><pathogenic virus><pathway><programs><protein synthesis><response><stress granule><translation><viral infection><viral pathogen><virology><virus infection><virus pathogen><virus protein><virus-induced disease>,Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Infectious Diseases
Finding and folding novel RNA structures,Finding and folding novel RNA structures,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Investigating the functional aspects of RNA structure is significant as it provides fundamental knowledge of RNA
biology and advances emergent technologies that seek to use, and target, RNA therapeutically. Major obstacles
to such efforts arise from our limited knowledge of the extent of functional RNA structure encoded within human
pathogenic viral genomes. This renewal seeks to advance upon our previous work that developed a
methodological pipeline for structured RNA discovery. This approach divides the discovery process into two
parts: a scanning step, where long sequences are decomposed into overlapping analysis windows from which
structure-related metrics are predicted and a folding step, where consensus structures across overlapping
windows are generated revealing the most sequence-ordered, thermodynamically stable structures (an
indication of an evolved property). Our approach has been very successful at identifying highly ordered and
functional structures across an array of human pathogens, e.g., SARS-CoV-2, where discovered motifs were
used to develop therapeutic leads. Our overarching hypothesis is that many regulatory RNA structures remain
to be found in the highly restricted space of viral genomes and that they can be uncovered using a holistic
research approach that combines computational and experimental methods. In this renewal, our goal is to make
improvements to our discovery pipeline to overcome its current limitations (most significantly to address higher
order RNA structure) and apply it to medically important viral genomes. The outcomes of this proposal will be:
(i) the generation of a robust methodological pipeline for functional RNA 2D and 3D structure discovery; (ii)
insight into novel regulatory features of pathogenic human viruses; and (iii) leads for future work to
therapeutically target RNA structure.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><3-D><3-D modeling><3-D structure><3-Dimensional><3-dimensional structure><3D><3D modeling><3D

Molecular Mechanism of Folding of Nsp12 and Assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA Polymerase Complex by the Cytosolic Chaperonin CCT,Molecular Mechanism of Folding of Nsp12 and Assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA Polymerase Complex by the Cytosolic Chaperonin CCT,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The COVID-19 pandemic created the greatest infectious threat to global health in 100 years,
and monumental efforts have been made by the scientific community to combat the SARS-CoV-
2 virus. This proposal seeks to extend this effort by investigating a mechanism by which SARS-
CoV-2 hijacks the host cell chaperone system to replicate itself. We have evidence that the
SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase (RdRp) co-opts the cytosolic chaperonin containing TCP-1
(CCT, also called TRiC) to assemble the active polymerase complex. CCT is a large (1 MDa)
protein-folding machine that plays a major role in the cellular chaperone network responsible for
maintaining the proteome in good working condition. It uses ATP hydrolysis-driven
conformational changes to assist cytosolic proteins with multiple domains, complex folding
trajectories, or obligate binding partners to achieve their native state and assemble into
complexes. In addition to folding cellular proteins, CCT has been shown to bind several viral
proteins and contribute to viral replication of HIV, hepatitis C, influenza A, rabies, Zika and
reovirus. These observations show that CCT is a common host chaperone used by diverse
viruses to fold viral proteins, assemble viral complexes, and support viral replication. Based on
these findings, we initiated an investigation of the role of CCT in SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here,
we present robust preliminary evidence indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein
12 (Nsp12), the catalytic subunit of the RNA polymerase, is folded by CCT and that CCT
contributes to RdRp complex formation and SARS-CoV-2 replication. In Aim 1, we propose to
thoroughly test this hypothesis using multiple experimental approaches. In Aim 2, we propose to
determine high-resolution structures of the complex between Nsp12 and CCT. We have isolated
an Nsp12 folding intermediate bound to CCT and have determined preliminary structures of the
complex by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Further cryo-EM analysis will yield a high-
resolution structure of the Nsp12-CCT complex, which will be invaluable in guiding the design of
therapeutics to block Nsp12 folding by CCT, inhibit formation of the RdRp complex, and disrupt
viral replication.","<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><AIDS Virus><ATP Hydrolysis><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome

Personal Respiratory Isolation System for Safe Transport and Treatment of Patients with Highly Transmissible Infectious Diseases,Personal Respiratory Isolation System for Safe Transport and Treatment of Patients with Highly Transmissible Infectious Diseases,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The goal of this project is to develop a solution that allows for rapid, safe, and
scalable initial treatment and transport of patients with highly transmissible infectious diseases, including
COVID-19 as well influenza, tuberculosis, chickenpox, and measles. This is a necessary innovation because
resource management and infectious transmission control were two of the greatest challenges healthcare
providers faced when fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. When a patient is suffering from highly transmissible
respiratory diseases and requires breathing assistance, they are placed in negative pressure rooms.
However, given the limited supply of negative pressure rooms available to prevent virus transmission, and
the misperception regarding the safety and effectiveness of negative pressure rooms, a new solution is
needed. To help prevent the spread of highly transmissible infectious diseases, start-up company Inspire Rx
has developed a personal negative pressure device called the AerosolVE™ BioHelmet. The BioHelmet is
capable of preventing the spread of aerosolized pathogens while also enabling the use of non-invasive
oxygen therapies on patients with respiratory diseases such as COVID-19, influenza, tuberculosis, etc. The
negative pressure AerosolVE™ BioHelmet immediately isolates patients with any highly transmissible
respiratory infectious disease and serves as an instant personal negative pressure environment that is more
effective than a traditional negative pressure room. The BioHelmet is intended to provide safe transportation
via ambulance, airplane, or helicopter, allowing critical transportation staff to remain safe, and it will be
valuable in a variety of other healthcare settings. In this project the team will refine and further evaluate the
AerosolVE BioHelmet, and they will leverage data from their previous in-cabin particle testing to advance the
BioHelmet as an effective tool at keeping a vehicle/transport cabin free from potentially pathogenic
respiratory particles. They will first refine the BioHelmet design to reduce noise and weight, and they will
fabricate 100 AerosolVE BioHelmets and 20 pump units for follow-on bench testing and clinical user
evaluations (Aim 1). They will conduct performance and bench testing at FDA-approved labs to ensure the
safety and efficacy of the AerosolVE BioHelmet per FDA guidelines (Aim 2). They will deploy the helmet for
clinical patient use during ground and air ambulance transportation of patients with suspected or confirmed
communicable respiratory illness, including those requiring potential aerosol-generating procedures, and the
purpose of this will be to obtain user feedback on comfort and east of use from patients and providers (Aim
3). The BioHelmet will provide a novel, compact, portable, and inexpensive solution that offers a safe
negative pressure environment both inside and outside the hospital, which will ultimately save lives by
allowing for needed patient treatments and protecting healthcare workers.",<Aerosols><Air><Air Ambulances><Ambulances><Body Weight decreased><Breathing><COVID crisis><COVID epidemic><COVID pandemic><COVID-19><COVID-19 crisis><COVID-19 epidemic><COVID-19 era><COVID-19 global health crisis><COVID-19 global pandemic><COVID-19 health crisis><COVID-19 pandemic><COVID-19 period><COVID-19 public health crisis><COVID-19 years><CPAP><CPAP Ventilation><CV-19><Chicken Pox><Chickenpox><Clinical><Clinical Evaluation><Clinical Testing><Collaborations><Communicable Diseases><Continuous Positive Airway Pressure><Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019><Data><Devices><Effectiveness><Ensure><Environment><Evaluation><Extravasation><FDA approved><Family><Feedback><Filtration><Filtration Fractionation><Friends><Goals><Grippe><Guidelines><Health Care Providers><Health Personnel><Health protection><Healthcare Providers><Healthcare worker><Helicopter><Helmet><Hospital Administrators><Hospitals><Hour><Human Resources><Individual><Infection><Infectious Disease Pathway><Infectious Diseases><Infectious Disorder><Influenza><Instruction><Investigators><Leakage><Life><M tuberculosis infection><M. tb infection><M. tuberculosis infection><M.tb infection><M.tuberculosis infection><MTB infection><Manpower><Measles><Medical><Michigan><Modification><Motor><Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection><Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection><Noise><Nurses><O element><O2 element><Oxygen><Oxygen Inhalation Therapy><Oxygen Therapy Care><Particulate><Pathogenicity><Patient Care><Patient Care Delivery><Patient Isolation><Patients><Patients Transportations><Performance><Physicians><Preparedness><Procedures><Production><Provider><Pump><Qualifying><Readiness><Research Personnel><Research Resources><Researchers><Resources><Respiratory Aspiration><Respiratory Disease><Respiratory Inspiration><Respiratory System Disease><Respiratory System Disorder><Risk><Rubeola><SARS-CoV-2 epidemic><SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis><SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic><SARS-CoV-2 pandemic><SARS-coronavirus-2 epidemic><SARS-coronavirus-2 pandemic><Safety><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 epidemic><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 pandemic><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic><Severities><Spillage><System><TB infection><Technology><Testing><Transmission><Transport of Wounded and Sick><Transportation><Transportation of Patients><Tuberculosis><Universities><Validation><Varicella><Viral Respiratory Tract Infection><Virion><Virus><Virus Particle><Visit><Warburg Therapy><Weight><Weight Loss><Weight Reduction><Work><aerosolized><body weight loss><care delivery><care for patients><care of patients><caring for patients><clinical test><commercialization><coronavirus disease 2019><coronavirus disease 2019 crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic><coronavirus disease 2019 global health crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic><coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic><coronavirus disease 2019 public health crisis><coronavirus disease crisis><coronavirus disease epidemic><coronavirus disease pandemic><coronavirus disease-19><coronavirus disease-19 global pandemic><coronavirus disease-19 pandemic><coronavirus infectious disease-19><cost><design><designing><disseminated TB><disseminated tuberculosis><evaluation/testing><fighting><future epidemic><future pandemic><health care personnel><health care settings><health care transport service><health care worker><health provider><health workforce><healthcare personnel><healthcare settings><healthcare transport service><improved><infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis><innovate><innovation><innovative><innovative technologies><inspiration><manufacture><medical personnel><meeting><meetings><morbilli><next epidemic><next pandemic><novel><nurse><oxygen administration><oxygen therapy><particle><pathogen><personnel><portability><pressure><prevent><preventing><prototype><research clinical testing><respiratory><respiratory pathogen><safety testing><severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global health crisis><severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic><success><tool><transmission process><treatment provider><tuberculosis infection><tuberculous spondyloarthropathy><validations><viral respiratory infection><viral transmission><virus transmission><weights><worker safety><workforce safety><wt-loss>,Biodefense and Related Countermeasures; Clinical Research; Coronaviruses; Emergency Care; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Health Services; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Patient Safety; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Tuberculosis
The Impacts of Adverse Provider Conditions on Provider Bias and Health Disparities,The Impacts of Adverse Provider Conditions on Provider Bias and Health Disparities,"Project Summary
Healthcare disparities that adversely affect patients from racial and ethnic minoritized groups are often attributed
to provider level factors such as implicit bias. However, efforts to reduce disparities have been hindered by an
incomplete knowledge of factors that leave providers more vulnerable to bias and their underlying mechanisms.
This proposal will address this critical knowledge gap by identifying situations that increase bias among
healthcare providers that can be intervened on at the provider and system level. The proposed research
leverages theory from psychology and psychoneuroimmunology to document the impact of three adverse
provider conditions (APCs) that could increase provider bias: (1) workplace demands (e.g., heightened levels of
stress or burnout), (2) concerns about one’s own health, and (3) increased inflammation occurring during illness.
We hypothesize that when providers experience higher (versus lower) workplace demands, are more (versus
less) concerned about their own health, and experience higher (versus lower) acute inflammation, they will
demonstrate more bias against patients from racial and ethnic minoritized groups. We will test our hypothesis in
the context of abdominal pain treatment in emergency departments. Participants will be attending physicians,
nurse practitioners, physician’s assistants, and residents in emergency medicine and internal medicine
hospitalists who treat abdominal pain for patients who are admitted. We will address three specific aims to
document effects of APCs on quality of care disparities. To address Aim 1, we will use a correlational design to
determine the relationship between APCs and standardized assessments of bias (implicit and explicit bias,
perception of others’ pain, and social avoidance). To address Aim 2, we will use a randomized controlled
intervention design; we will use the influenza vaccine to simulate illness by experimentally increasing
inflammation (indexed by pro-inflammatory cytokine levels). Increases in cytokines are hypothesized to be
positively associated with standardized assessments of bias. To address Aim 3, we will use a prospective,
longitudinal design to tracks provider illness symptoms, stress, burnout, and local cases of infectious illness over
the course of a year. These provider data will be correlated with patient data from abdominal pain cases treated
by the provider on those days. This study has high ecological validity and findings will identify distinct
contributions of APCs to lower quality of care, especially for patients from racial and minoritized groups. Overall,
the proposed research will have widespread positive impact by outlining paths for novel interventions at multiple
levels and domains of influence within the NIMHD Research Framework, such as by engaging administrator and
clinical management stakeholders in conversations about consequences of staffing policies for health disparities.",<Abdominal Pain><Accident and Emergency department><Acute><Address><Administrator><Admission><Admission activity><Affect><Ally><Asian><B cell differentiation factor><B cell stimulating factor 2><B-Cell Differentiation Factor><B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2><B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2><BCDF><BSF-2><BSF2><Beta Proprotein Interleukin 1><Black><Black race><Blood><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Caring><Clinical Management><Cognitive><Computerized Medical Record><Data><Decision Making><Decrease disparity><Development><Disparities><Disparity><Doctor's Assistants><ED visit><ER visit><Electronic Medical Record><Emergency Department><Emergency Medicine><Emergency care visit><Emergency department visit><Emergency hospital visit><Emergency room><Emergency room visit><Equity><Ethnic Origin><Ethnicity><Goals><HPGF><Health><Health Care Providers><Health Care Systems><Health Inequity><Health Personnel><Health Policy><Healthcare><Healthcare Providers><Healthcare Systems><Healthcare worker><Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor><Hospitalists><Hour><Hybridoma Growth Factor><IFN-beta 2><IFNB2><IL-1 beta><IL-1 β><IL-1-b><IL-1β><IL-6><IL1-Beta><IL1-β><IL1B Protein><IL1F2><IL1β><IL6 Protein><Image><Individuals from minority><Individuals of minority><Inequalities in Health><Inequities in Health><Inflammation><Inflammatory><Influenza Vaccines><Interleukin 1beta><Interleukin-1 beta><Interleukin-1β><Interleukin-6><Internal Medicine><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Job Location><Job Place><Job Setting><Job Site><Knowledge><Laboratories><Latine><Latinx><Lead><Length of Stay><Link><Lower disparity><MGI-2><Measures><Medical><Methods><Minority Groups><Minority People><Minority Population><Minority individual><Motivation><Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein><NCMHD><NIMHD><National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities><National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities><National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities><Number of Days in Hospital><Nurse Practitioners><Pain><Pain Control><Pain Therapy><Pain management><Painful><Participant><Patient Care><Patient Care Delivery><Patient outcome><Patient-Centered Outcomes><Patient-Focused Outcomes><Patients><Pb element><Perception><Physical distancing><Physician Assistants><Physicians><Physicians' Extenders><Placebos><Plasmacytoma Growth Factor><Policies><Preinterleukin 1 Beta><Prejudice><Provider><Psychology><Psychoneuroimmunology><QOC><Quality of Care><Race><Races><Racial Group><Randomized><Reporting><Research><Role><Sham Treatment><Sick Leave><Social Distance><Source><Standardization><Stress><Symptoms><System><Testing><Time><Training><Vaccines><Work Location><Work Place><Work-Site><Workplace><Worksite><burn-out><burnout><care for patients><care of patients><caring for patients><clinician factors><clinician-level factors><cytokine><design><designing><developmental><disparity in care><disparity in health><disparity in healthcare><disparity reduction><effective intervention><ethnic minority group><ethnic minority individual><ethnic minority people><ethnic minority population><experience><explicit bias><flu vaccine><flu virus vaccine><health care><health care disparity><health care inequality><health care inequity><health care personnel><health care policy><health care worker><health disparity><health inequalities><health provider><health workforce><healthcare disparity><healthcare inequality><healthcare inequity><healthcare personnel><healthcare policy><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><hospital days><hospital length of stay><hospital stay><imaging><implicit bias><improved><indexing><influenza virus vaccine><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><interferon beta 2><intervention design><interventional strategy><longitudinal design><marginalization><medical personnel><mitigate disparity><novel><pain perception><pain treatment><patient oriented outcomes><physician factors><physician-level factors><programs><prospective><provider factors><provider-level factors><psychoneuroimmunological><racial><racial background><racial minority group><racial minority individual><racial minority people><racial minority population><racial origin><racial population><racial subgroup><randomisation><randomization><randomly assigned><recruit><reduce disparity><reduction in disparity><response><sham therapy><social><social norm><social role><standardize measure><theories><therapy design><treatment design><treatment provider><vaccine against flu><vaccine against influenza><work setting>,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Chronic Pain; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Health Services; Pain Research; Prevention; Racial and Ethnic Minority Health Research; Social Determinants of Health
Type 1-2 immune cross-regulation in the lung,Type 1-2 immune cross-regulation in the lung,"Project Summary
Respiratory viral infections are a prevalent and ongoing threat to global health, as evidenced by seasonal
Influenza A infections and the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Notably, the association between allergy and asthma
and the severity of respiratory viral illness has been long observed but poorly understood. Group 2 innate
lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and the adaptive counterpart Type 2 CD4 helper cells (Th2) have been extensively
investigated for their role in allergic inflammation. Our group has described the localization of these type 2
lymphocytes (T2L) in non-lymphoid tissues, such as the lung, at rest and under allergic and mixed type 1-2
inflammation, observing localization near large airways and vessels at rest and expansion to the tissue
parenchyma with allergic inflammation. Interestingly, in mixed type 1-2 inflammation, T2L parenchymal
distribution is restricted due to Interferon gamma (IFNγ) signaling on T2L. My preliminary data demonstrates that
IFNγ-mediated restriction also occurs following viral respiratory infection with Influenza A virus (IAV, PR8) and
impacts mouse body weight and lung function. In parallel, I have demonstrated that loss IFNα/β signaling on
T2Ls increases body weight loss and impairs lung function in IAV, potentially through a distinct mechanism.
These data suggest that IFN-mediated restriction of T2L and T2L topography is critical for appropriate viral
clearance and/or tissue repair in viral respiratory infection. Mechanisms of IFN-mediated restriction of T2L have
been explored by many groups, including ours, however how this restriction of topography and counter-regulation
of T1 immunity by T2L dictate the immune response to viral infection remains elusive. I hypothesize that IFN
signaling regulates the topography and function of lung T2Ls in pulmonary viral infections. This proposal will
define the topography of T1-T2 cross-regulation in the setting of pulmonary viral infection (Aim 1) and evaluate
mechanism of interferon mediated restriction of type 2 lymphocytes (Aim 2). Completion of these aims will
elucidate the role of canonical type 1 and type 2 cytokines in mediating tissue resident lymphocyte function in
complex inflammation, providing novel mechanistic insight into how topography dictates immunity. Completion
of this study provides a foundation for the development of precision therapeutics to selectively regulate lung
resident lymphocytes subsets to impact the outcome of diverse lung diseases.",<(IFN) α><(IFN)-α><(IFN)α><3-D Imaging><3-D modeling><3D imaging><3D modeling><Acute><Alferon><Allergic><Allergic Disease><Allergic inflammation><Allergy><Alveolar><Amphiregulin><Apoptotic><Asthma><B Cell Differentiation Factor I><B cell growth factor 2><B-Cell Growth Factor-II><BCGF-II><BCGF2><Bacteria><Body Tissues><Body Weight><Body Weight decreased><Bronchial Asthma><COVID crisis><COVID epidemic><COVID pandemic><COVID-19 crisis><COVID-19 epidemic><COVID-19 era><COVID-19 global health crisis><COVID-19 global pandemic><COVID-19 health crisis><COVID-19 infection><COVID-19 pandemic><COVID-19 period><COVID-19 public health crisis><COVID-19 virus infection><COVID-19 years><COVID19 infection><CRGF><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Death><Cell Death Induction><Cell Signaling><Cessation of life><Chronic><Colorectum Cell-Derived Growth Factor><Complex><Confocal Microscopy><Data><Death><Development><Disease><Disorder><Distal><Eo-CSF><Eosinophil Differentiation Factor><Fibroblasts><Foundations><Goals><Helper Cells><Helper T-Cells><Helper T-Lymphocytes><Helper-Inducer T-Cells><Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte><Human><Hypersensitivity><IFN><IFN Alpha><IFN α><IFN-Gamma><IFN-g><IFN-α><IFN-γ><IFNG><IFNa><IFNα><IFNγ><IL-13><IL-5><IL13><IgA enhancing factor><Immune><Immune Interferon><Immune response><Immune system><Immunes><Immunity><Immunological response><Impairment><Individual><Inducer Cells><Inducer T-Lymphocytes><Induction of Apoptosis><Infection><Inflammation><Influenza A><Influenza A virus><Influenza Viruses Type A><Influenzavirus A><Interferon Alfa-n3><Interferon Gamma><Interferon Type II><Interferon alpha><Interferon-α><Interferons><Interleukin 5 Precursor><Interleukin-13><Interleukin-5><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Keratinocyte-Derived Autocrine Factor><L monocytogenes><L. monocytogenes><Leukocyte Interferon><Listeria monocytogenes><Lung><Lung Diseases><Lung Inflammation><Lung Parenchyma><Lung Respiratory System><Lung Tissue><Lung damage><Lung infections><Lymphatic cell><Lymphoblast Interferon><Lymphoblastoid Interferon><Lymphocyte><Lymphocyte Function><Lymphocyte Subpopulations><Lymphocyte Subset><Lymphocytic><Lymphoid Cell><Mediating><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modeling><Modern Man><Morbidity><Morbidity -

Immunological mechanism of muscle-localizing self-replicating RNA vaccines,Immunological mechanism of muscle-localizing self-replicating RNA vaccines,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
As evident in the ongoing “tripledemic” of severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2, Respiratory
Syncytial virus, and Influenza virus, as well as re-emergence of enterovirus D68, virus infection is an important
health threat and a huge economic burden. Multivalent RNA vaccination is an effective measure for counteracting
virus infections and cancerous threats. However, multivalent vaccines need to inject relatively larger doses of
RNA than monovalent vaccines, which can trigger a potent innate immune response in vivo, causing reduced
transgene expression and unwanted reactogenicity. We have recently found that high dose RNA vaccination can
be safely achieved in mice by delivering self-amplifying replicon RNA (repRNA) with a family of muscle-localizing
cationic nanocarriers, LIONTM. In vivo delivery of repRNA by LION restricted the formulation to the muscle and
local lymph nodes without inducing unwanted systemic cytokine responses. Systemic blockade of type I IFN
signaling increased transgene expression and the subsequent antibody and T cell responses. Notably, we also
found that CD11b+ cells [mostly monocyte dendritic cells (DC)] expand over time after intramuscular injection of
repRNA/LION. However, the role of the muscle-infiltrating cells in immunogenicity is unknown. Consequently,
many questions remain about how repRNA/LION vaccines induce adaptive immune responses and how
transgene expression and adaptive immune responses are inhibited by the type I IFN system. So, Aim 1 looks
at skeletal muscle DC (SMDC) and characterizes their immunological function both in vitro and in vivo. Aim 2
focuses on type I IFN signaling and seeks to identify how type I IFN signaling limits transgene expression and
adaptive immune responses to repRNA vaccines. Aim 3 spotlights the inflammatory responses to muscle
damage and their role in inducing adaptive immune responses to repRNA/LION vaccines. The proposed studies
will test the following hypotheses that (1) the muscle plays a critical role in eliciting the immune response to
intramuscular-based RNA vaccines, and (2) muscle-restricted activation of the immune system is a novel
strategy for RNA vaccines to achieve high efficacy with reduced reactogenicity.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><ADP Phosphohydrolase><ADPase><ATP Diphosphohydrolase><ATP-ADPase><ATP-Diphosphatase><Ablation><Adenosine Diphosphatase><Affect><Antibodies><Antibody Response><Antigens><Apyrase><Blood monocyte><CD11b><CD4 Cells><CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes><CD4 T cells><CD4 helper T cell><CD4 lymphocyte><CD4+ T-Lymphocyte><CD4-Positive Lymphocytes><CD8 Cell><CD8 T cells><CD8 lymphocyte><CD8+ T cell><CD8+ T-Lymphocyte><CD8-Positive Lymphocytes><CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes><COVID-19 virus><COVID19 virus><CR3A><Cancerous><Caspase><Caspase Gene><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Differentiation><Cell Differentiation process><Cell Signaling><Cell-Death Protease><Cells><Cellular Immune Function><CoV-2><CoV2><Cysteine Endopeptidases><Cysteine Protease><Cysteine Proteinases><DNA Endonuclease><DNase I><Dendritic Cells><Deoxyribonuclease I><Dose><EV-68><EV-D68><Economic Burden><Emulsions><Enterovirus 68><Enterovirus D68><Family><Flow Cytofluorometries><Flow Cytofluorometry><Flow Cytometry><Flow Microfluorimetry><Flow Microfluorometry><Formulation><Genes><Germinal Center><Grippe><Health><Helper Cells><Helper T-Cells><Helper T-Lymphocytes><Helper-Inducer T-Cells><Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte><Human><Hydrogen Oxide><ICE-like protease><IFN><IFNAR><IFNAR1><IFNAR1 gene><IL-1><IL1><ITGAM><ITGAM gene><Immune Cell Activation><Immune response><Immune system><Immunochemical Immunologic><Immunologic><Immunologic Subtyping><Immunological><Immunological response><Immunologically><Immunologics><Immunophenotyping><In Vitro><Inducer Cells><Inducer T-Lymphocytes><Infiltration><Inflammatory><Inflammatory Response><Influenza><Influenza Virus><Innate Immune Response><Interferons><Interleukin I><Interleukin-1><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Intramuscular><Intramuscular Injections><Lymph Node Reticuloendothelial System><Lymph node proper><Lymphatic nodes><Lymphocyte-Stimulating Hormone><MAC1A><MO1A><Macrophage Cell Factor><Marrow monocyte><Measures><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Molecular><Murine><Mus><Muscle><Muscle Cells><Muscle Tissue><Myocytes><Non-Polyadenylated RNA><Oils><Pancreatic DNase><Physiologic pulse><Play><Pulse><RIP3><RIPK3><RIPK3 gene><RNA><RNA Gene Products><RNA immunization><RNA replication><RNA vaccination><RNA vaccine><RNA-based vaccine><Receptor-Interacting Protein 3><Receptor-Interacting Serine/Threonine Protein Kinase 3><Replication Unit><Replicon><Respiratory syncytial virus><Ribonucleic Acid><Role><SARS corona virus 2><SARS-CO-V2><SARS-COVID-2><SARS-CoV-2><SARS-CoV2><SARS-associated corona virus 2><SARS-associated coronavirus 2><SARS-coronavirus-2><SARS-related corona virus 2><SARS-related coronavirus 2><SARSCoV2><Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome CoV 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Corona Virus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus 2><Severe acute respiratory syndrome associated corona virus 2><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2><Severe acute respiratory syndrome related corona virus 2><Signal Pathway><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Skeletal Muscle><Squalene><Structure of germinal center of lymph node><System><T Helper Factor><T cell response><T memory cell><T4 Cells><T4 Lymphocytes><T8 Cells><T8 Lymphocytes><Testing><Thymonuclease><Time><Transgenic Mice><Vaccination><Vaccines><Veiled Cells><Viral Diseases><Virus Diseases><Voluntary Muscle><Water><Wuhan coronavirus><adaptive immune response><antigen-specific T cells><biological signal transduction><cellular differentiation><coronavirus disease 2019 virus><coronavirus disease-19 virus><cystein protease><cystein proteinase><cysteine endopeptidase><cytokine><deliver mRNA><deliver messenger RNA><delivery system for mRNA><emergent virus><emerging virus><flow cytophotometry><hCoV19><host response><human pathogen><immune activation><immune function><immune system response><immunogen><immunogenic><immunogenicity><immunophenotype><immunoresponse><in vivo><influenzavirus><intramuscular drug administration><lymph gland><lymph nodes><lymphnodes><lymphocyte activating factor><mRNA delivery><mRNA immunization><mRNA vaccination><mRNA vaccine><mRNA-based vaccine><memory T lymphocyte><messenger RNA delivery><monocyte><mouse model><murine model><muscular><nCoV2><nano-string><nanocarrier><nanostring><nanovessel><neutralizing antibody><new approaches><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><pharmacologic><protein expression><response><social role><transgene expression><vaccine efficacy><viral emergence><viral infection><virus infection><virus-induced disease>,Biodefense and Related Countermeasures;

Biophysical studies of viral membrane fusion proteins,Biophysical studies of viral membrane fusion proteins,"SUMMARY
Influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin (HA) is the canonical example of a class-I viral fusion protein, and thus
provides an ideal model system for understanding the fusion mechanisms of many different viruses. Numerous
other viral envelope glycoproteins, including the SARS-CoV-2 spike, are believed to mediate fusion by a
comparable mechanism. Our long-term goal is to establish a complete mechanistic framework of class-I viral
fusion. We further aim to identify conserved and divergent features of the fusion mechanisms of distinct viruses,
generating specific models that fit within the general framework. HA resides on the surface of the IAV virion and
facilitates attachment to the target cell surface through the receptor-binding domain (HA1) engaging SA moieties.
Following endocytosis and trafficking to the late endosome, HA promotes fusion of the viral and endosomal
membranes. The model of HA-mediated membrane fusion describes a “spring-loaded” metastable prefusion
conformation at neutral pH. Dissociation of HA1 from the fusion domain (HA2) allows HA2 to undergo a cascade
of conformational changes that drive membrane fusion. While extensive structural data exist for HA pre- and
postfusion, and alternative conformations have been visualized and inferred, the conformational trajectory that
leads to membrane fusion, including the adoption of anticipated intermediates, has never been explicitly
validated. Nor has the order and timing of conformational changes and membrane fusion been determined. Here,
we will utilize a multifaceted approach involving single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer imaging,
single-virion fusion, cryoelectron tomography, and molecular dynamic simulation to directly visualize the
conformational trajectory undergone by HA during membrane fusion. We will explore the roles of virion
morphology, HA density and cooperativity, and target membrane lipid content in mediating HA conformational
changes and the mechanism of fusion. We will describe the allosteric connection between distal regions of HA
that regulate the timing of fusion, drawing comparison to SARS-CoV-2 S. Finally, we will biophysically
characterize the phenotypic differences between human and avian IAV strains to determine what prevents avian
IAV strains from entering the human population.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><2019-nCoV S protein><2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein><2019-nCoV spike

Observational causal inference with infectious disease outcomes,Observational causal inference with infectious disease outcomes,"Project Summary
Infectious disease is a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. Transmission dynamic models have
played a critical role in guiding interventions related to many infectious pathogens, including HIV, influenza,
SARS-CoV-1, ebolaviruses, SARS-CoV-2, and mpox. Models project how potential interventions (e.g., non-
pharmaceutical measures, therapeutics, and vaccines) may affect disease future transmission. However, they
often rely on small scale studies to project effects, and there have been growing concerns that models may
produce inaccurate, overly optimistic estimates of population-level intervention effectiveness. Observational
causal inference models, which measure intervention effectiveness in real-world settings, could help address
this limitation, but applying these to infectious disease is not straightforward. Observational approaches, such
as difference-in-differences and synthetic control methods, estimate the impact of an intervention based on
empirical counterfactuals: comparing outcomes of interest between treated units or places and similar
untreated units. While well-understood with linear outcomes, they can produce biased and misleading results
in the context of nonlinear transmission dynamics. Even where observational models perform well, it further
remains challenging to transport estimates to new settings to project the impact of future interventions. To
address these issues, this project will develop comprehensive theoretical architecture for synthesizing
transmission dynamic models with observational causal inference models – employing empirical
counterfactuals while accounting for complex biological and population dynamics. In the retrospective
workstream, I will propose robust specifications for observational causal inference models that can estimate
unbiased treatment effects in policy evaluations using infectious disease outcomes. I will also develop model
selection and decision-analytic methods to address potentially significant parameter uncertainty. In the
prospective workstream, I will develop approaches to generalize estimates from observational causal inference
models to new settings using transmission dynamic models and update projected effects in real-time based on
local surveillance indicators. I will illustrate the implications of our methods by re-analyzing prior studies on
COVID-19 as well as applying them to answer new questions about respiratory illness control, in collaboration
with partners in state and local public health institutions. Across both workstreams, I will develop and
disseminate open-source public tools and software to facilitate adoption of these methods. Overall, this work
will produce a suite of methodological innovations to improve understanding of the impact of past policies and
the accuracy of future projections, while also supporting their implementation in public health institutions to
guide planning and priority setting.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Address><Adoption><Affect><Architecture><Biological><COVID-19><COVID-19 virus><COVID19 virus><CV-19><CoV-2><CoV2><Collaborations><Communicable Diseases><Complex><Computer software><Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019><Data><Disease><Disease Outbreaks><Disease Outcome><Disorder><EBOV><Ebola virus><Ebola-like Viruses><Effectiveness><Effectiveness of Interventions><Engineering / Architecture><Future><Grippe><HIV><Health Planning><Health Policy><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Infectious Disease Pathway><Infectious Diseases><Infectious Disorder><Influenza><Institution><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><LAV-HTLV-III><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Measures><Methodology><Methods><Modeling><Monkey Pox><Monkeypox><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Outbreaks><Outcome><Play><Policies><Policy Analyses><Policy Analysis><Population><Population Dynamics><Public Health><Role><SARS Virus><SARS corona virus><SARS corona virus 2><SARS coronavirus><SARS-Associated Coronavirus><SARS-CO-V2><SARS-COVID-2><SARS-CoV><SARS-CoV-1><SARS-CoV-2><SARS-CoV2><SARS-Related Coronavirus><SARS-associated corona virus 2><SARS-associated coronavirus 2><SARS-coronavirus-2><SARS-related corona virus 2><SARS-related coronavirus 2><SARSCoV2><Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus><Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome CoV 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Corona Virus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome corona virus><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus 2><Severe acute respiratory syndrome associated corona virus 2><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2><Severe acute respiratory syndrome related corona virus 2><Software><Specific qualifier value><Specified><Therapeutic><Time><Transmission><Uncertainty><Update><Vaccines><Virus-HIV><Work><Wuhan coronavirus><analytical method><biologic><coronavirus disease 2019><coronavirus disease 2019 virus><coronavirus disease-19><coronavirus disease-19 virus><coronavirus infectious disease-19><doubt><hCoV19><health care policy><healthcare policy><improved><innovate><innovation><innovative><interest><intervention effect><interventional strategy><mortality><mpox><nCoV2><open source><pathogen><plan health><policy evaluation><prospective><respiratory><severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV><social role><tool><transmission process><treatment effect>,Biodefense and Related Countermeasures; Clinical Research; Coronaviruses; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Health Services; Infectious Diseases; Prevention
Role of ERK1/2 signaling in SARS-CoV-2 -induced dysregulated immunity and lung pathology.,Role of ERK1/2 signaling in SARS-CoV-2 -induced dysregulated immunity and lung pathology.,"Project Summary (Abstract):
 Emerging and re-emerging respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and
avian and swine influenza viruses continue to pose a significant challenge to public health. These highly
pathogenic viruses successfully evade host immunity and replicate to high titers, causing excessive
inflammation, acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and fatal pneumonia.
However, the host and virus factors that facilitate impaired antiviral response and excessive inflammation
(dysregulated immunity) that lead to ALI and lung pathology are not known. In novel preliminary findings,
we identify that toll-like receptor (TLR)-extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 activity is central to SARS-
CoV-2 and viral-RNA-induced dysregulated lung immunity. Notably, blocking ERK1/2 activity not only
reduced SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory cytokine production but also enhanced antiviral IFN-I
response. Therefore, based on our strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that myeloid cell-intrinsic TLR-
ERK1/2 signaling promotes pathogenic lung inflammation and suppresses antiviral immunity. The primary
objective of the proposed study is to demonstrate the critical role of myeloid-cell TLR-ERK1/2 signaling in
SARS-CoV-2-induced dysregulated immunity, acute lung injury (ALI), and lung pathology, and to evaluate
the therapeutic potential of blocking ERK1/2 activity in suppressing lethal inflammation while enhancing
antiviral. We will define the role of myeloid cell-intrinsic TLR-ERK1/2 activity in SARS-CoV-2-induced lung
injury and pathology (Aim 1), demonstrate the role of myeloid cell intrinsic TLR-ERK1/2 activation in the
dysregulation of SARS-CoV-2-specific lung T cell response (Aim 2), and test the therapeutic potential of
blocking ERK1/2 signaling with or without antivirals in reducing lung injury and protecting mice from lethal
SARS-CoV-2 infection (Aim 3). The results obtained from this study will provide a foundation for identifying
specific targets to moderate lung inflammation and injury, which in combination with antivirals, can be used

TMPRSS2 as a potential target for treatments of COVID-19 and respiratory infectious viruses in lung,TMPRSS2 as a potential target for treatments of COVID-19 and respiratory infectious viruses in lung,"Project Summary
 In early 2020, a new virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), generated headlines due to
its unprecedented rate of transmission. SARS-CoV-2 caused the first reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
in December 2019 and continues to spread worldwide. As a family of RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is prone to mutate at a rate
up to a million times faster than its hosts1,2. These rapid genomic alterations have already generated highly transmissible
variants, and have raised concerns that the virus will evade vaccine-induced immunity. In addition, a large percentage of
the global population remains unvaccinated, due to the challenges of production and mass distribution, vaccine hesitancy,
and pending approval status for patients under age 12. Therefore, an effective antiviral has the potential to relieve suffering
for millions—not only helping individual patients recover and reducing the number of deaths, but also limiting the number
of positive carriers and thereby curbing the spread of the pandemic.
 This proposal aims to develop an efficient antiviral to impede the virus’ entry into cells, specifically into lung alveolar type
II (AT2) cells, the stem cells of the distal lung. Thanks to recent studies, we know which “door” (a receptor called ACE2) and
“key” (a protease called TMPRSS2) the virus uses to enter cells. Our goal is to remove the key so the virus cannot open the
door and enter host cells. We will use a conventional air-liquid interface (ALI) culture that is representative of the in vivo
airway and a recently developed 3-dimensional (3D) in vitro lung organoid model that recapitulates many aspects of lung
structure and the cellular environment and that has been used to study respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. These
systems represent tissues better than cell lines, but offers the benefit of being less complex than tissue explants or animal
models. In addition, we have generated a panel of highly sensitive and specific mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
directed against TMPRSS2. In preliminary studies, the lead TMPRSS2 mAb, AL20, shows no signs of cytotoxicity with a trend
towards inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry in cell lines and in lung organoids. Furthermore, we have identified at
least two serine protease inhibitors (serpins) that form complexes with TMPRSS2, and the presence of these complexes is
inversely correlated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. These findings lead to our hypothesis that targeting TMPRSS2 can
inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and spread.
 To test our hypothesis, we will first test the efficacy of AL20 for blocking the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into AT2 cells in lung
organoids and in airway epithelial cells in ALI cultures, and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We will then evaluate the
effects of serpins on TMPRSS2 activity and SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and spread. Finally, to explore the feasibility of advancing
AL20 to human trials, we will test humanized AL20 in a SARS-CoV-2 hamster model. Syrian golden hamsters are naturally
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection that recapitulates the clinical, virological, histopathological, and immunological
characteristics of human disease, enabling study of its pathogenesis, transmission, and passive immunization effect.
Transgenic human ACE2 is not required for SARS-CoV-2 infection, ensuring that the cell types infected are highly relevant.
 These studies will provide critical insights into the mechanisms whereby TMPRSS2 regulates SARS-CoV-2 entry, and suggest
potential therapeutic candidates against COVID-19. The proposed work has the potential to impact the lives of millions of
individuals affected by COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, such as influenza A, that use TMPRSS2 to enter cells.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><2019-nCoV S

A cryo-box for a 200 kV TEM,A cryo-box for a 200 kV TEM,"Project Summary
 Our laboratory has a long standing interest in understanding the catalytic and regulatory mechanism of
the proton pumping vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase, V1Vo-ATPase), a dynamic multisubunit membrane integral
rotary motor enzyme found in all eukaryotic cells. The V-ATPase acidifies the lumen of organelles and, in
professional acid secreting cells, the extracellular space. Enzyme function is required for fundamental cellular
processes such as endocytosis, bone remodeling, protein trafficking, acid-base balance, sperm maturation,
and neurotransmitter release. While complete loss of V-ATPase function is embryonic lethal, partial loss or
hyperactivity is associated with numerous human diseases such as osteopetrosis, diabetes, male infertility,
neurodegeneration, and cancer. Moreover, some viruses such as influenza rely on the acidic environment
created by the V-ATPase for infection. Fighting these diseases on a molecular level will require a detailed
understanding of the structure, catalytic mechanism and regulation of the eukaryotic V-ATPase. In cells, V-
ATPase activity is regulated by a unique mechanism referred to as “reversible disassembly”, wherein the
complex reversibly dissociates into V1-ATPase and Vo proton channel, with both sub-complexes becoming
autoinhibited. Despite its important role in V-ATPase physiology, the molecular mechanism of reversible
disassembly is poorly understood. This gap in knowledge is largely due to a lack of both high-resolution
structural information and an in vitro model system to study the process under defined conditions, aspects that
we are working to address. An interesting, and technically challenging feature of the mammalian V-ATPase is
that most of its subunits are expressed as multiple isoforms. However, as such isoforms display differential
tissue enrichment, they may provide opportunities for targeted therapeutics. Indeed, several diseases have
been linked to malfunction or upregulation of specific isoform containing V-ATPase. However, how different
isoform combinations determine tissue localization, and whether these isoform specific complexes have unique
biochemical or regulatory properties, is currently unknown. We have started to develop a system to purify wild
type and mutant forms of human V-ATPase in an isoform specific fashion for biochemical and structural
analyses. Further, we are developing single-domain antibodies (Nanobodies) against specific subunit isoforms
to serve as research tools, and to explore isoform specific modulation of V-ATPase activity in disease. Our
research program employs the tools of structural biology, cell biology, biochemistry and biophysics to address
broad questions of V-ATPase catalytic and regulatory mechanisms. For some fundamental aspects of V-
ATPase structure and regulation, we study the enzyme from yeast, a well documented model system for the
human V-ATPase. We use human tissue culture for questions that cannot be addressed in yeast, such as
structure and biochemical properties of specific isoform containing enzymes. The long term goal of our
research is to find ways to modulate the activity of disease causing V-ATPases in an isoform specific way.",<ATP phosphohydrolase><ATPase><Acid-Base Balance><Acid-Base Equilibrium><Acids><Address><Adenosine Triphosphatase><Albers-Schoenberg Disease><Albers-Schonberg disease><Binding><Biochemical><Biochemistry><Biologic Models><Biological Chemistry><Biological Models><Biophysics><Body Tissues><Bone remodeling><Cancers><Cell Body><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell secretion><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Cellular Secretion><Cellular biology><Complex><Diabetes Mellitus><Differential Display><Disease><Disorder><Dissociation><Embryo><Embryonic><Endocytosis><Environment><Enzyme Gene><Enzymes><Eukaryotic Cell><Extracellular Space><Funding><Goals><Grippe><H(+) Pump><H+ Pump><H+ element><Human><Hydrogen Ions><Hyperactivity><Infection><Influenza><Intercellular Space><Isoforms><Knowledge><Laboratories><Link><Lipids><Male Infertility><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Marble Bone Disease><Maturation of Spermatozoa><Membrane><Model System><Modern Man><Molecular><Molecular Interaction><Motor><Multienzyme Complexes><Nerve Degeneration><Neuron Degeneration><Organelles><Organism><Osteopetrosis><Osteosclerosis Fragilis><Physiology><Process><Property><Protein Isoforms><Protein Trafficking><Proton Pump><Protons><Regulation><Renal tubular acidosis><Request for Proposals><Research><Resolution><Role><Sperm Maturation><Structure><Subcellular Process><System><Tissues><Up-Regulation><Upregulation><V-ATPase><V-type ATPase><Viral Diseases><Virus><Virus Diseases><Yeasts><biophysical foundation><biophysical principles><biophysical sciences><bone remodelling><cell biology><diabetes><differential display technique><enzyme complex><fighting><human disease><human tissue><in vitro Model><inhibitor><interest><living system><mRNA Differential Displays><malignancy><marble bone><membrane structure><microbial><mutant><nanobodies><nanobody><nanodisk><neoplasm/cancer><neural degeneration><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neurological degeneration><neuronal degeneration><neurotransmitter release><novel><programs><protein transport><renal tubule acidosis><resolutions><sdAb><single domain antibodies><social role><structural biology><targeted drug therapy><targeted drug treatments><targeted therapeutic><targeted therapeutic agents><targeted therapy><targeted treatment><tissue culture><tool><vacuolar ATPase><vacuolar H+-ATPase><vacuolar membrane H(+)-ATPase><viral infection><virus infection><virus-induced disease>,Infectious Diseases; Rare Diseases
Preclinical and IND enabling studies for treatment of advanced lung cancer and other cancers metastatic to lung by pulmonary delivery of engineered Influenza A Virus (eIAV),Preclinical and IND enabling studies for treatment of advanced lung cancer and other cancers metastatic to lung by pulmonary delivery of engineered Influenza A Virus (eIAV),"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
There are more than 230,000 new cases of lung cancer and over 130,000 deaths due to lung cancer each year
in the U.S. Approximately 120,000 people each year will present with metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
(mNSCLC) for the first time, and only 7% of these patients will survive five years or more.
accurius is developing the first of a kind inhalable agent that will be a safe and highly effective treatment for
mNSCLC and other cancers metastatic to the lung. The agent is an engineered oncolytic virus based on the
Influenza A virus (eIAV) which will selectively infect and destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy cells and
induce the body’s own anti-tumor immune response. This treatment will dramatically improve overall survival
rates for the metastatic NSCLC patient population as well for the 50,000 patients each year with different tumor
types that have their cancer metastasize to the lung.
Phase I of the accurius project will determine the top two eIAV candidates in the accurius pipeline, each of
which must improve median survival time by more than 50% versus the control arm in animal models while
showing significant ability to elicit the natural immune response to the presence of the tumors. Follow-up
testing will determine if either or both of the candidates can improve median survival time by an additional 25%
in combination with an immune checkpoint blocker.
Phase II will finalize the cell culture-based manufacturing process for the candidate(s) which passed both tests
in phase I and also optimize their inhalable form. The inhalable forms will then have to pass the same efficacy
and natural immune response stimulation tests as in Phase I as well as demonstrating safety in animal models
without tumors in order to proceed to further clinical testing in humans.
The potential realizable market for accurius’s safe, inhalable, effective eIAV is over 100,000 metastatic lung
cancer patients annually in the US alone, the vast majority of whom will not respond to currently available
treatments and face dismal survival prospects.",<Active Follow-up><Address><Agreement><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Animals><Body Weight decreased><Breathing><Cancer Model><Cancer Patient><CancerModel><Cell Body><Cell Culture Techniques><Cells><Cessation of life><Clinic><Clinical Evaluation><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Clinical Testing><Collaborations><Combination Drug Therapy><Data><Death><Development><Diagnostic><Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm><Distant><Dose><Drug Targeting><Engineering><Face><Formulation><Goals><Human><Immune><Immune Cell Activation><Immune Markers><Immune mediated therapy><Immune response><Immunes><Immunity><Immunologic Markers><Immunological response><Immunologically Directed Therapy><Immunotherapy><Influenza A><Influenza A virus><Influenza Viruses Type A><Influenzavirus A><Infusion><Infusion procedures><Injections><Injury><Intellectual Property><Intravenous><Joints><Lead><Licensing><Lung><Lung Neoplasms><Lung Respiratory System><Lung Tumor><Malignant Cell><Malignant Tumor of the Lung><Malignant neoplasm of lung><Marketing><Mediating><Metastasis><Metastasis to the Lung><Metastasize><Metastatic Cancer><Metastatic Lesion><Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm><Metastatic Mass><Metastatic Neoplasm><Metastatic Neoplasm to the Lung><Metastatic Tumor><Metastatic Tumor to the Lung><Metastatic to><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Murine><Mus><NSCLC><NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer><Nebulizer><Neoplasm Metastasis><Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer><Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma><Oncology><Oncology Cancer><Oncolytic viruses><Orthomyxovirus Type A><Overdose><Patients><Pb element><Persons><Phase><Polychemotherapy><Primary Neoplasm><Primary Tumor><Process><Production><Pulmonary Cancer><Pulmonary Neoplasms><Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm><Respiratory Aspiration><Respiratory Inspiration><SBIR><Safety><Secondary Neoplasm><Secondary Tumor><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Survival Rate><T cell infiltration><Testing><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Effect><Time><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Treatment Efficacy><Type A Influenza><United States><Up-Regulation><Upregulation><Weight Loss><Weight Reduction><active followup><anti-tumor immune response><arm><body weight loss><cancer cell><cancer metastasis><cell culture><cell cultures><check point blocker><checkpoint blockers><chemotherapy><clinical test><combination chemotherapy><combination pharmacotherapy><commercial application><commercialization><developmental><effective therapy><effective treatment><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><faces><facial><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><host response><immune activation><immune check point blocker><immune checkpoint blockers><immune system response><immune therapeutic approach><immune therapeutic interventions><immune therapeutic regimens><immune therapeutic strategy><immune therapy><immune-based biomarkers><immune-based therapies><immune-based treatments><immune-mediated adverse events><immune-related adverse effect><immune-related adverse events><immune-related adverse reaction><immuno therapy><immunological biomarkers><immunological markers><immunoresponse><improved><infusions><injuries><inspiration><intervention efficacy><lung cancer><lung metastasis><manufacture><manufacturing process><medical college><medical schools><metastasize to the lung><model of animal><mouse model><murine model><nebulization><nebulize><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new technology><new therapeutics><new therapy><next generation therapeutics><novel><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel technologies><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><patient population><pre-clinical><pre-clinical efficacy><preclinical><preclinical efficacy><pulmonary><pulmonary metastasis><research clinical testing><response><school of medicine><success><therapeutic efficacy><therapy efficacy><tumor><tumor cell metastasis><wt-loss>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Cancer; Immunotherapy; Lung; Lung Cancer
Epigenetic Regulation of the Maturation and Function of Lung Epithelium by the SWI/SNF Proteins ARID1A and ARID1B.,Epigenetic Regulation of the Maturation and Function of Lung Epithelium by the SWI/SNF Proteins ARID1A and ARID1B.,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 It is being increasingly recognized that changes in chromatin state are associated with a wide spectrum of
lung diseases, ranging from bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD). However, the mechanisms by which these changes contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases,
and how to manipulate the epigenome for therapeutic benefit, remains largely unknown. Modulation of chromatin
accessibility is an important epigenetic mechanism by which gene expression is controlled, even across repeated
cell divisions. However, as a prerequisite to understanding how altered chromatin accessibility contributes to
disease, the mechanisms by which chromatin accessibility patterns first establish and maintain cellular identity
within the lung must be defined.
 This proposal is based on studies from our group that identified the SWI/SNF proteins Arid1a and Arid1b
as key mediators of the chromatin accessibility changes that occur during development of the SOX9+ lung
epithelial stem/progenitor cell population. Our data demonstrate that loss of Arid1a or Arid1b led to persistence of
the SOX9+ progenitor cell population, impaired alveolar differentiation, and neonatal death due to respiratory
distress. In addition, ARID1A directly interacts with NKX2-1 and SOX9. The central hypothesis of the present
proposal is that ARID1A and ARID1B interact with key lung developmental TFs to direct the SWI/SNF complex to
remodel chromatin at specific loci, silencing progenitor cell gene expression programs and promoting the
maturation and function of the mature alveolar epithelium. The proposed studies will: A) Define the role that
Arid1a/Arid1b, and the larger SWI/SNF complex, play in establishment of mature alveolar cell type identify in
mouse and human. B) Identify the mechanism(s) by which this SWI/SNF complex remodels chromatin, in
conjunction with key lung transcription factors, to establish and maintain gene expression modules controlling
type I & II AEC identity and function. C) Determine how Arid1a/Arid1b-mediated chromatin remodeling contributes
to the lung epithelial repair response following influenza infection.
 These studies will provide conceptual advances in our understanding of how mature alveolar epithelial
cells are established and maintained, how the chromatin accessibility landscape interacts with previously well-
defined transcription factor networks, and how chromatin remodeling direct the normal repair process after lung
injury. Emerging epigenomic tools and systems biology approaches will be applied to the epithelium for the first

Impacting Inflammation through Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (imTOR),Impacting Inflammation through Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (imTOR),"Inflammatory diseases limit healthspan, defined as the length of one’s life spent in good health. We propose an
ancillary study to an NIA-funded trial U01AG076941 (EVERLAST) that we call Impacting inflammation through
mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin (imTOR). The EVERLAST parent trial will test the ability of low/intermittent
doses of the rapamycin analogue everolimus to selectively inhibit mTORC1 but not mTORC2, and thus
improve multiple indicators of healthspan, while avoiding the undesirable side-effects of rapamycin. Analysis of
immune cells as major sources of mTOR-regulated inflammation, coupled with analysis in the context of parent
trial outcomes, would significantly enhance the value of EVERLAST without changing subject burden. imTOR
thus responds to NOT-AG-23-020 “Maximizing the Scientific Value of Secondary Analysis of Existing Cohorts
and Datasets in Order to Address Research Gaps and Foster Additional Opportunities in Aging Research”.
EVERLAST is enrolling middle-aged to older adults who are generally healthy but are overweight/obese and
insulin resistant to take placebo or everolimus daily (0.5mg), or everolimus once weekly (5mg) for 24 wks.
EVERLAST will determine the impact of this intervention on fundamental hallmarks of aging including changes
in metabolism, muscle function, brain health, senescence, and frailty. imTOR will expand the scope of
EVERLAST beyond flu vaccine-generated immune responses by quantitating the impact of everolimus on
chronic inflammation, a key cause of age-related health declines generated mainly by immune cells. imTOR
will focus mainly on CD4+ T cells based on our data showing these cells are dominant sources of inflammation
in healthy and obesity-associated aging. imTOR is designed to test the overall hypothesis that everolimus
lowers the risk of age-related health problems by reducing chronic inflammation through mechanisms that
include improved bioenergetics and redox balance in immune cells. We will complement primary focus on T
cells with analyses of myeloid cells, the latter a secondary source of systemic inflammation. Mechanistic
insights into everolimus action on immune cells will be analyzed relative to changes in hallmarks of aging
collected for EVERLAST. We will compare mitochondrial outcomes between immune cells and skeletal muscle
to challenge the assumption of similar everolimus impacts on distinct tissue types. Parallel ex vivo
manipulations will establish cause/effect relationships amongst everolimus, mTORC1/2 function, cell
physiology, cytokine profiles, and the frequency of polyfunctional T cells, a newly appreciated modulator of
inflammatory disease. Success with the proposed project coupled with EVERLAST outcomes will determine
safety and efficacy of everolimus for promoting healthspan in our ever-aging population.",<Address><Age of Onset><Aging><Ancillary Study><Animals><Bioenergetics><Blood><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Body Tissues><CCI-779><CD4 Cells><CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes><CD4 T cells><CD4 helper T cell><CD4 lymphocyte><CD4+ T-Lymphocyte><CD4-Positive Lymphocytes><Cardiac><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Cycle Inhibitor 779><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Chronic><Clinical Trials><Cognition><Cognitive><Compensation><Complement><Complement Proteins><Complex><Confocal Microscopy><Coupled><Data><Data Set><Disease><Disorder><Dose><Drugs><Effectiveness><Enrollment><Equilibrium><FK506 Binding Protein 12-Rapamycin Associated Protein 1><FKBP12 Rapamycin Complex Associated Protein 1><FRAP1><FRAP1 gene><FRAP2><Fostering><Frequencies><Funding><Health><Human><Immune><Immune response><Immunes><Immunological response><Immunomodulation><Immunosuppression><Immunosuppression Effect><Immunosuppressive Effect><In Vitro><Increase lifespan><Infection><Inflammaging><Inflammation><Inflammatory><Influenza Vaccines><Institution><Insulin Resistance><Intermediary Metabolism><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Lead><Length><Life><Link><Lysosomes><Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin><Mediator><Medication><Metabolic><Metabolic Processes><Metabolism><Mitochondria><Modern Man><Muscle function><Myeloid Cells><Obesity><Outcome><Outcome Study><Over weight><Overweight><Oxidation-Reduction><Parents><Pathway interactions><Pb element><Persons><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Placebos><Position><Positioning Attribute><Process><Production><Proteomics><RAFT1><Rapamune><Rapamycin><Rapamycin Analog><Rapamycin Analog CCI-779><Redox><Regimen><Research><Research Resources><Resources><Risk><Risk Management><SDZ RAD><Safety><Sampling><Sham Treatment><Shipping><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Sirolimus><Skeletal Muscle><Source><Subcellular Process><T-Cells><T-Lymphocyte><T4 Cells><T4 Lymphocytes><Testing><Tissues><Voluntary Muscle><Weight><adiposity><age associated><age associated decline><age associated disease><age associated disorder><age associated impairment><age correlated><age dependent><age dependent decline><age dependent disease><age dependent disorder><age dependent impairment><age linked><age related><age related decline><age related human disease><age specific><age-related disease><age-related disorder><age-related impairment><age-related inflammation><aged group><aged groups><aged individual><aged individuals><aged muscle><aged people><aged person><aged persons><aged population><aged populations><aging associated><aging biological marker><aging biomarker><aging marker><aging of muscle><aging population><aging related><animal data><balance><balance function><biological signal transduction><brain health><clinical practice><cohort><complementation><computer based prediction><corpulence><cytokine><decline with age><design><designing><drug action><drug/agent><elongating the lifespan><enroll><everolimus><extend life span><extend lifespan><flu vaccine><flu virus vaccine><frailty><gain of function><geroprotective><geroprotector><hallmarks of aging><health-span><healthspan><healthy aging><healthy human aging><healthy life span><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><host response><immune modulation><immune regulation><immune suppression><immune suppressive activity><immune suppressive function><immune system response><immunologic reactivity control><immunomodulatory><immunoregulation><immunoregulatory><immunoresponse><immunosuppressive activity><immunosuppressive function><immunosuppressive response><improved><inflamm-ageing><inflamm-aging><influenza virus vaccine><inhibitor><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><insulin resistant><insulin tolerance><intervention effect><interventional strategy><lens><lenses><lifespan extension><loss of function><mTOR><mammalian target of rapamycin><mid life><mid-life><middle age><middle aged><midlife><mitochondrial><mitochondrial metabolism><muscle aging><older adult><older adulthood><oxidation reduction reaction><parent><pathway><pharmacologic><pillars of aging><population aging><predictive modeling><prevent><preventing><secondary analysis><senescence><senescent><sham therapy><side effect><success><systemic inflammation><systemic inflammatory response><thymus derived lymphocyte><vaccine against flu><vaccine against influenza><vaccine response><vaccine responsiveness><vaccine-induced response><weights>,Aging; Clinical Research; Obesity
Research Supplement for Alveolar Responses to Viral Lung Infection,Research Supplement for Alveolar Responses to Viral Lung Infection,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Significance. One-third of patients with severe lung infection by influenza A virus (IAV) develop secondary
infection by inhaled Staphylococcus aureus (SA). Coinfection by IAV and SA causes about 30% mortality despite
therapy. It remains unclear how IAV promotes secondary SA infection, particularly in lung alveoli. This issue is
important because alveoli are the anatomical site of fatal SA-induced Acute Lung Injury (ALI), but alveolar
defense mechanisms, including alveolar wall liquid (AWL) secretion, should prevent SA stabilization and
coinfection initiation. The long-term objective of this proposal is to determine alveolar responses to IAV that
promote secondary SA infection in alveoli, resulting in SA-induced alveolar damage, ALI, and mortality. The
hypothesis is IAV lung infection inhibits AWL secretion, a homeostatic mechanism by which alveoli clear inhaled
particles. The inhibition causes alveolar retention of SA and the secreted SA toxin, alpha hemolysin (Hla). The
retention enhances alveolar contact with SA and Hla, promoting SA stabilization against the alveolar wall and
Hla-induced alveolar fluid barrier loss, leading to alveolar edema and fatal ALI. In addition to directly supporting
the hypothesis, preliminary data indicate IAV lung infection caused: (A) dephosphorylation, hence inactivation of
the alveolar cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel, the critical protein for
AWL secretion; and (B) methylation of the CFTR-dephosphorylating protein, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)
catalytic subunit (PP2Ac), which may promote PP2Ac-CFTR interactions. Specific Aims are as follows. Aim 1
will define the role of CFTR in alveolar retention of inhaled SA. Aim 2 will define the role of PP2Ac methylation
in IAV-induced inhibition of AWL secretion. Since our preliminary data suggest CFTR and the PP2Ac-
methylating enzyme, leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (LCMT1) may represent new therapeutic targets to
restore AWL secretion in IAV-infected lungs, Aim 3 will test the therapeutic potential of CFTR- and LCMT1-
targeted approaches to protect against coinfection-induced alveolar damage, ALI, and mortality. These Aims
will be achieved using our established methods, which include cell culture, mouse models of ALI, and real-time
confocal microscopy of live, intact mouse and human lungs. Determinations in IAV-infected mice will include
measures of: (1) alveolar retention of SA; (2) AWL secretion; (3) alveolar CFTR phosphorylation status;
(4) alveolar PP2Ac methylation status; (5) SA- and Hla- alveolar epithelial damage and alveolar barrier loss; and
(6) SA-induced pulmonary edema and mortality. We will use: (i) wild type mice treated with inhibitors of alveolar
PP2Ac-CFTR and PP2Ac-LCMT1 interactions, including drug inhibitors, plasmid DNA encoding mutant proteins,
and siRNA; and (ii) transgenic mice lacking alveolar epithelial CFTR and LCMT1 expression. This proposal is
expected to achieve new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which IAV disrupts critical alveolar function
leading to fatal ALI, and to establish restoration of AWL secretion – that is, “AWL rescue” – as a new therapeutic
approach for ALI caused by IAV-SA coinfection. Therefore, this proposal addresses the NHLBI mission.","<0-11 years old><21+ years old><Accounting><Acute Lung Injury><Acute Pulmonary Injury><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Airway

New York City Virus Hunters - A Community Science Initiative,New York City Virus Hunters - A Community Science Initiative,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
We aim to increase student’s understanding and interest in science through active participation in the first large-
scale surveillance initiative targeting avian viruses like influenza viruses (AIV) and avian paramyxoviruses
(APMV, also known as Newcastle disease virus) ever conducted in an urban area - New York City (NYC) - via
analysis of bird droppings. The New York City Virus Hunters (NYCVH) initiative will enable teachers, students
and interested community members to gain an understanding of the interaction of natural environments and
human health, while increasing their knowledge, confidence, and interest in science.
The NYCVH initiative will build on strong collaborations between the Krammer Laboratory at the Icahn School of
Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), a globally leading laboratory in virology, and BioBus, a leading NYC science
outreach and education institution. NYCVH will develop and provide all the training, equipment, materials, and
infrastructure needed to support this large-scale, community-science-driven research effort. NYCVH will be
designed to offer multiple entry points and levels of engagement for interested community scientists - such as
students, teachers or community members - to participate. Trainings will ensure that interested teachers gain an
understanding of modern viral surveillance techniques and have ways to easily incorporate NYCVH program
aspects of their choice into their work. Over the course of the program, 6000 middle and high school students
will be led by 100 teachers trained at workshops held at BioBus’s BioBase Harlem inside Columbia University’s
Zuckerman Institute. Workshops will introduce teachers to modern viral surveillance using molecular techniques,
experimental design, laboratory and bioinformatics methods, sampling kit components, and detail how teachers
and students can participate in research to prevent the next pandemic. Through BioBus’ network we will enlist
partner schools to broaden participation in the program including through large-scale sampling events. In
addition, and importantly, 25 high school students from historically underrepresented communities in science will
be trained to spearhead the initiative as Junior Research Scientists who will join the NYCVH as interns over the
academic year and get an intensive training in sampling, nucleic acid detection, sequencing, phylogenetic
analysis and virology in general to become the next generation of leading virologists. With ISMMS, BioBus and
plus a network of scientists from academic institutions and wildlife rehabilitators, those students will be supported
throughout their research process – study design, sample collection, sample processing, analyzing results, and
presenting their research at symposia.
This project will be evaluated using a mixed-methods approach tailored to understanding the impact of program
participation on all individuals. The structure of this program is designed to determine the feasibility and impact
of large-scale studies at the urban human – avian interface through participatory research, and influence on
student’s long-term STEM career goals.","<21+ years old><Adult><Adult Human><Aves><Avian><Avian Paramyxovirus 1><Avian Paramyxoviruses><Avulavirus><Awareness><Bio-Informatics><Bioinformatics><Birds><Broadening Participation><Collaborations><Collection><Columbidae><Communication><Communities><Curriculum><DNA Molecular Biology><Data><Data Analyses><Data Analysis><Data Collection><Development><Disadvantaged><Doves><Drops><Education><Education and Outreach><Educational Curriculum><Educational aspects><Educational process of instructing><Educational workshop><Ensure><Environment><Equipment><Event><Experimental Designs><Faculty Education><Faculty Training><Feces><Fostering><Genbank><Goals><Health><High School Student><Human><Individual><Influenza Virus><Infrastructure><Institution><Instruction and Outreach><Internet><Internships><Junior High School Student><Junior High Student><Knowledge><Laboratories><Learning><Mentors><Mentorship><Methods><Middle School Student><Modern Man><Modernization><Molecular><Molecular Biology><New York><New York City><Newcastle disease virus><Nucleic Acids><Participant><Peer Review><Personalized medical approach><Phase><Phylogenetic Analysis><Phylogenetics><Pigeons><Process><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Publications><Race><Races><Research><Research Design><Research Infrastructure><SEQ-AN><STEM career><STEM workforce><Sampling><Schools><Science><Scientific Publication><Scientist><Secondary School Student><Secondary Student><Sequence Analyses><Sequence Analysis><Spanish/English><Structure><Student recruitment><Students><Study Type><System><Teacher Education><Teacher Educator><Teacher Preparation><Teacher Professional Development><Teacher Training><Teaching><Techniques><Training><Training and Outreach><Tutoring and Outreach><Underrepresented Ethnic Minority><Underrepresented Groups><Underrepresented Minority><Underrepresented Populations><Universities><Update><Viral><Virus><WWW><Work><Workshop><Youth><Youth 10-21><adulthood><after-school program><afterschool program><avian paramyxovirus serotype 1><broadening participation research><college student><community based organizations><community organizations><community science><conference><convention><data dissemination><data interpretation><design><designing><developmental><faculty development><faculty professional development><future pandemic><health literacy><high school><high schoolers><individualized approach><influenzavirus><innovate><innovation><innovative><instructor training><interest><intern><junior high><junior high school><learning engagement><lesson plans><medical college><medical schools><member><middle school><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new therapeutics><new therapy><new vaccines><next generation><next generation therapeutics><next generation vaccines><next pandemic><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><novel vaccines><nucleic acid detection><peer><personalized approach><precision approach><prevent><preventing><programs><racial><racial background><racial origin><recruit><sample collection><school of medicine><science, technology, engineering and math career><science, technology, engineering and math workforce><science, technology, engineering and mathematics career><science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce><service learning><service-based learning><specimen collection><stool><study design><summit><symposia><symposium><tailored approach><teacher><teacher development><under representation of groups><under represented groups><under represented people><under represented populations><under-representation of minorities><under-represented minority><underrepresentation of groups><underrepresentation of minorities><underrepresented people><university student><urban area><urban location><urban region><virology><web><world wide web>",Clinical Research; Pediatric; Social Determinants of Health
Eosinophils as Effectors of Antibacterial Immunity in the Lungs,Eosinophils as Effectors of Antibacterial Immunity in the Lungs,"Pneumonia results from uncontrolled lung inflammation and injury often triggered by viral/bacterial pathogen
insults. Pneumococci, instigating agents of bacterial pneumonia, are independently pathogenic causing lower
respiratory tract infections and hospitalizations in adults, including those with chronic pulmonary conditions like
asthma. Pneumococci are also opportunistic pathogens particularly synergizing with respiratory viruses, like
influenza A virus (IAV), to cause severe morbidity and excess mortality. Our prior work established that IAV
infection during heightened eosinophilic allergic inflammation was host protective, recapitulating clinical data
from the 2009 Swine Flu pandemic. Using a laboratory model we developed to investigate mechanisms by which
this protection occurred, we identified novel functions for eosinophils as direct mediators of antiviral immunity
during early and late phases of IAV infection. Importantly, eosinophilic asthma was also host protective during
co-infection with IAV and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), an outcome that was lost in eosinophil deficient
mice. Further preliminary data show that eosinophils, a) internalize Spn in large numbers, b) kill intracellular and
extracellular Spn, c) undergo physiologic and phenotypic alterations in response to Spn uptake. These data led
to our central hypothesis that eosinophils in allergic airways promote anti-bacterial immunity against Spn through
direct and indirect mechanisms to reduce the bacterial load and safeguard the host. The two overlapping aims
to be investigated in this project are: (1) To determine mechanisms and outcomes of interactions between
eosinophils and Spn, and (2) To elucidate pathways by which eosinophil-Spn interactions impact surrounding
leukocytes important in mucosal host defense during co-infection. This project is significant because we propose
to identify basic immune mechanisms in pulmonary host defense against a prominent human pathogen with an
innovative approach of investigating eosinophils as a regulator of local innate immunity and mediator of host
protection rather than as an end-stage effector cell. These studies will have a broad impact on eosinophil biology,
on our appreciation of host-pathogen interactions in allergic asthma and may offer novel therapeutic targets to
treat bacterial co-infections during influenza in allergic hosts.",<21+ years old><Adult><Adult Human><Airway infections><Allergic><Allergic asthma><Allergic inflammation><Alveolar Macrophages><Anti-Bacterial Agents><Asthma><Bacteria><Bacterial Infections><Bacterial Pneumonia><Biology><Blood Eosinophil><Blood leukocyte><Body Tissues><Bronchial Asthma><CD4 Cells><CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes><CD4 T cells><CD4 helper T cell><CD4 lymphocyte><CD4+ T-Lymphocyte><CD4-Positive Lymphocytes><CD8 Cell><CD8 T cells><CD8 lymphocyte><CD8+ T cell><CD8+ T-Lymphocyte><CD8-Positive Lymphocytes><CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes><Cessation of life><Chronic><Clinical Data><Complex><D pneumoniae><D. pneumoniae><Data><Death><Diplococcus pneumoniae><Effector Cell><Elements><Eosinophil cationic protein><Eosinophil-Associated Ribonuclease><Eosinophilia><Eosinophilic Granulocyte><Eosinophilic Leukocyte><Espanol><Excess Mortality><Extrinsic asthma><Failure><Goals><Grippe><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Host Defense><Immune><Immune reaction><Immune response><Immune system><Immunes><Immunity><Immunobiology><Immunological response><Immunomodulation><Immunophysiology><Infection><Inflammation><Influenza><Influenza A><Influenza A virus><Influenza Viruses Type A><Influenzavirus A><Informal Social Control><Innate Immune System><Innate Immunity><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Invaded><Knowledge><Laboratories><Leukocytes><Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System><Lower Respiratory Tract Infection><Lower respiratory infection><Lung><Lung Inflammation><Lung Respiratory System><Lung damage><Marrow Eosinophil><Marrow leukocyte><Mediating><Mediator><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modeling><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Mucosa><Mucosal Immune System><Mucosal Immunity><Mucosal Tissue><Mucous Membrane><Murine><Mus><Native Immunity><Natural Immunity><Non-Specific Immunity><Nonspecific Immunity><Orthomyxovirus Type A><Outcome><Pathogenicity><Pathology><Pathway interactions><Patients><Phagocytes><Phagocytic Cell><Phase><Phenotype><Physiologic><Physiological><Pneumococcal Infections><Pneumococcus><Pneumonia><Pneumonitis><Proteins><Public Health><Pulmonary Inflammation><Pulmonary Macrophages><RNS3 Protein><RNase 3><Research><Respiratory Infections><Respiratory Tract Infections><Role><S pneumoniae><S. pneumoniae><Self Regulation><Serum Eosinophil Cationic Protein><Skin><Spanish><Streptococcus pneumoniae><Streptococcus pneumoniae Infections><T cell response><T4 Cells><T4 Lymphocytes><T8 Cells><T8 Lymphocytes><Testing><Therapeutic><Tissues><Type A Influenza><Viral><Viral Diseases><Virus Diseases><White Blood Cells><White Cell><Work><adulthood><amebocyte><anti-bacterial><anti-viral immunity><antiviral immunity><arm><asthma patient><asthmatic><asthmatic patient><atopic asthma><bacteria infection><bacteria pathogen><bacteria pneumonia><bacterial disease><bacterial pathogen><bactericidal><bactericide><clinical relevance><clinically relevant><co-infection><coinfection><eosinophil><eosinophilic asthma><expectation><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><extracellular><extrinsic allergic asthma><flu virus pandemic><fungus><host response><human pathogen><immune modulation><immune regulation><immune system response><immunologic reactivity control><immunomodulatory><immunoreaction><immunoregulation><immunoregulatory><immunoresponse><improved><in vivo><influenza virus pandemic><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><interventional strategy><lung injury><mortality><mouse model><murine model><new drug target><new druggable target><new pharmacotherapy target><new therapeutic target><new therapy target><novel><novel drug target><novel druggable target><novel pharmacotherapy target><novel therapeutic target><novel therapy target><opportunistic pathogen><pandemic flu><pandemic influenza><pandemic strain of influenza><pathogen><pathogenic bacteria><pathway><pneumococcal disease><pneumococcus infection><prevent><preventing><pulmonary><pulmonary damage><pulmonary injury><pulmonary tissue damage><pulmonary tissue injury><respiratory pathogen><respiratory virus><response><social role><swine flu><swine origin flu><swine origin influenza><uptake><viral infection><virus infection><virus-induced disease><white blood cell><white blood corpuscle>,Asthma; Biodefense and Related Countermeasures; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Influenza; Lung; Pneumonia; Pneumonia and Influenza
BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR,BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal disease, and shingles lead to significant rates of illness,
hospitalization, and death among older adults. In the United States, vaccination rates have been mostly unchanged for a
decade with lower rates among racial and ethnic minority groups. New and scalable approaches are needed to address this
important public health issue.
Nudges are changes to the way choices are offered or information is framed that can have outsized effects on behavior.
For example, default options are the path of least resistance and the action that takes place if no alternatives are selected.
Active choice is a method that prompts a decision-making now, rather than waiting for stakeholders to recognize the need
to make the decision on their own. Our groups at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Medicine) and the University of
Washington (UW Medicine) have formed behavioral design teams embedded within the operations of our health systems
and have demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic
health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, this scalable technology platform is
an optimal environment to implement and deploy these types of nudges.
In this study, we propose to design, test, and implemented personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target barriers
among high-risk subgroups to improve vaccination rates. We will pilot this at two health systems and then implement a
pragmatic trial at those health systems and sites in the VA Health System. In the R61 phase, we will focus on the
following aims at Penn Medicine and UW Medicine. Aim 1: To use EHR data and analytical methods to identify high-risk
groups of older adults with suboptimal vaccination rates for influenza, pneumococcal disease, and herpes zoster. Aim 2:
To assess the feasibility of implementing different types of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target the
identified groups to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 3: To pilot test ways to personalize promising
nudges to clinicians and patients for improving vaccination among older adults.
In the R33 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine, UW Medicine, and the VA Health System. Aim
1: To conduct a 12-month, multisite, cluster randomized, pragmatic trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized
nudges to clinicians and patients relative to control to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 2: To evaluate

Novel Hybrid Computational Models to Disentangle Complex Immune Responses,Novel Hybrid Computational Models to Disentangle Complex Immune Responses,"Most quantitative models in biomedical research have been formulated by ordinary differential equations 
(ODEs). Despite the great contributions ODEs have made to biology and beyond, the high-dimensional, 
time-dependent factors of the immune system still pose a significant challenge to the predictive value of 
ODEs as it would require several hundred equations and thousands of parameters to be estimated. The 
recent rise of machine learning as a powerful computational tool to integrate large datasets presents a 
special opportunity to deal with the inherent complexity of biological systems. However, machine learning 
approaches do not consider the mechanistic knowledge of the underlying interactions. Preliminary studies 
that combine ODEs and machine learning highlight that these computational algorithms could be on the 
cusp of a major revolution. Remarkably enough, however, no parameter estimation theory exists to 
integrate simultaneously both approaches. We propose to create new hybrid models and test their 
predictions in a mouse viral coinfection system to address a central vexation for infection biology which is 
how and when to modulate immune responses to mitigate mortality during lethal respiratory viral infection. 
At the interface between mathematical and life sciences, we will develop and analyze a novel suite of 
computational models that will integrate the underlying biological mechanisms to manage ill-posed 
problems and explore massive design spaces, allowing for robust predictions from complex biological 
systems. To validate and test our novel and foundational mathematical approaches, we will generate the 
biological data from a mouse infection system with a mild viral pathogen (rhinovirus) two days before 
infection with a lethal viral pathogen (influenza) that results in reduced disease compared to single infection 
alone. We hypothesize that this system can train our mathematical models in a natural way how the innate 
immune system can be manipulated to reduce mortality to lethal infections and beyond. Key model 
predictions will be tested by targeted immune system manipulation during lethal infection, paving the way to 
understanding the role of complex immune interactions in respiratory viral disease pathology.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><Address><Antigen-Antibody Complex><Biologic Sciences><Biological><Biological Sciences><Biology><Biomedical Research><Bioscience><COVID crisis><COVID epidemic><COVID pandemic><COVID-19 crisis><COVID-19 epidemic><COVID-19 era><COVID-19 global health crisis><COVID-19 global pandemic><COVID-19 health crisis><COVID-19 pandemic><COVID-19 period><COVID-19 public health crisis><COVID-19 virus><COVID-19 years><COVID19 virus><Causality><Cell model><Cellular model><CoV-2><CoV2><Collaborations><Computational algorithm><Computational toolkit><Computer Models><Computerized Models><Computing Methodologies><Dangerousness><Data><Differential Algebraic Equation><Differential Equation><Dimensions><Disease><Disorder><Educational process of instructing><Equation><Equilibrium><Etiology><Europe><Event><Family><Generations><Grippe><Hybrids><Idaho><Immune><Immune Complex><Immune Targeting><Immune mediated therapy><Immune response><Immune system><Immunes><Immunologic Factors><Immunological Factors><Immunological response><Immunologically Directed Therapy><Immunomodulation><Immunotherapy><Infection><Influenza><Innate Immune System><Knowledge><Lab Findings><Laboratory Finding><Life Sciences><Machine Learning><Math><Math Models><Mathematics><Measures><Mediating><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modeling><Molecular><Morbidity><Morbidity -

High-throughput identification of antibody features for sequence-based epitope prediction,High-throughput identification of antibody features for sequence-based epitope prediction,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human antibody repertoire is highly diverse due to VDJ recombination and somatic hypermutation. VDJ
recombination is a somatic recombination process that assembles the variable region of an antibody from a
diverse set of gene segments, known as variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) genes. During the course of
an immune response, antibodies will increase affinity to their antigens through somatic hypermutation. The
huge diversity of antibodies enables human immune system to confer protection against various pathogens by
recognizing a wide range of antigens and epitopes. Detailed molecular characterization of antibody-antigen
interaction is crucial to vaccine and therapeutic development, as well as the fundamental understanding of the
human immune system.
 The binding specificity and epitope of an antibody are determined by its structure, which in turn is
determined by its amino acid sequence. As a result, information on the binding specificity and epitope of an
antibody are encoded in its amino acid sequence. However, accurately predicting the epitopes of antibodies
from their sequences is an extremely difficult task because our understanding of antibody sequence-function
relationship is far from comprehensive. This proposal aims to develop a library-to-library screening approach to
characterize antibody-antigen interaction in a high-throughput manner, with a focus on influenza A
hemagglutinin (HA) as a proof-of-concept. Specifically, we will determine the HA-binding specificity and
conformational epitope of hundreds of thousands of antibodies in a single experiment. Subsequently, antibody
sequence features that are associated with different epitopes on HA will be systematically identified. We further
aim to use these antibody features to identify HA-binding antibodies from publicly available antibody repertoire
sequencing datasets as well as predict their epitopes on HA. While this proposed project focuses on influenza
HA, our approach can be easily extended to any antigen of interest. This proposal will open up the possibility
for antibody sequence-based epitope prediction and provides new perspectives to the understanding of human
antibody repertoire.",<Affinity><Amino Acid Sequence><Antibodies><Antibody Diversity><Antibody Repertoire><Antibody Specificity><Antigenic Determinants><Antigens><Base Sequence><Binding><Binding Determinants><DNA Recombination><Data Set><Epitopes><Genes><Genetic Recombination><Hemagglutinin><Human><Ig Somatic Hypermutation><Immune response><Immune system><Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation><Immunoglobulin V(D)J Rearrangement><Immunological response><Influenza A><Influenza A virus><Influenza HA><Influenza Hemagglutinin><Influenza Viruses Type A><Influenzavirus A><Libraries><Modern Man><Molecular><Molecular Configuration><Molecular Conformation><Molecular Interaction><Molecular Stereochemistry><Nucleotide Sequence><Orthomyxovirus Type A><Primary Protein Structure><Process><Recombination><Specificity><Structure><Type A Influenza><V(D)J Rearrangement><V(D)J Recombination><VDJ rearrangement><VDJ recombination><conformation><conformational><conformational state><conformationally><conformations><develop a vaccine><develop vaccines><development of a vaccine><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><flu HA><flu hemagglutinin><host response><immune system response><immunogen><immunoresponse><influenza viral HA><influenza viral hemagglutinin><influenza virus HA><influenza virus hemagglutinin><interest><novel><nucleic acid sequence><pathogen><protein sequence><screening><screenings><somatic hypermutation><therapeutic agent development><therapeutic development><vaccine development>,Biodefense and Related Countermeasures; Biotechnology; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Immunization; Infectious Diseases
Overcome immunodominance to support the development of universal influenza vaccines,Overcome immunodominance to support the development of universal influenza vaccines,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An ideal ""universal flu vaccine"" should have the ability to trigger broadly protective antibody and humoral memory
responses against both existing and future influenza viral strains. However, a major obstacle in achieving this
goal is immunodominance in B cell responses, which tend to prioritize dominant epitopes at the expense of
conserved yet subdominant epitopes. In the case of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA), the variable globular head
domain is highly immunodominant over the stem epitope that is much more conserved. To address this challenge,
a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist-based nanoparticle (NP) adjuvant (TLR7-NP) has been developed to induce
prolonged and localized TLR7 signaling in the draining lymph nodes. In contrast to TLR7 agonist formulated with
alum (TLR7-alum), the TLR7-NP adjuvant has demonstrated a remarkable ability to overcome
immunodominance and stimulate a broad antibody response targeting the subdominant HA stem epitope. There
is a critical need to understand the precise mechanisms controlling B cell immunodominance and the breadth of
humoral responses. The goal of this research is to gain mechanistic insights into how adjuvant formulation
influences B cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors that shape immunodominance and the breadth of humoral
responses. The overarching hypothesis is that the interplay between B cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors,
prompted by prolonged TLR signaling through nanoparticle formulated adjuvant, facilitates the recruitment,
selection and effector differentiation of germinal center (GC) B cells specific for the subdominant epitopes. This
hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine how TLR7-NP impacts
immunodominance, breadth and tolerance across different stages of B cell memory development. The goal of
this aim is to identify the “bottleneck” that has the greatest influence on the immunodominance and breadth of
the humoral response. Aim 2 will elucidate the interplay between extrinsic factors and B cells underlying the
enhancement of antibody breadth by TLR7-NP. In this aim, we will use genetic models to manipulate the
surrounding cell types as well as the microenvironment to investigate how these specific pathways contribute to
the altered B cell immunodominance, a crucial mechanism underlying the breadth induced by TLR7-NP. This
research proposal is innovative because it makes a conceptual advance in understanding the mechanisms
governing the breadth of humoral responses, linking it to the spatiotemporal regulation of signaling through
adjuvant formulation. This research proposal is significant because these insights will not only advance our
understanding of how vaccine adjuvants work but also will empower us to refine vaccine strategies to precisely
manipulate the breadth of B cell response. Ultimately, this will unlock new opportunities for the rational design of
universal influenza vaccines.

Neuroimmune control of lung inflammation,Neuroimmune control of lung inflammation,"Project Summary:
Regulation of immune responses in the lung is a critical determinant of health. While the immune system must
respond to viral and bacterial pathogens, these responses must be finely tuned so as not to reduce organ
function. Aberrant immune responses to viral pathogens in the lung can result in significant morbidity and
mortality.
Control of maladaptive host immune responses occurs through a number of mechanisms including input from
the nervous system. Reciprocal communication between these two systems throughout the body has emerged
as a mechanism to detect pathogens and coordinate host-protective immune responses and control
inflammation. Although neuro-immune circuits in the lung are known to exist, the contribution of these to the
regulation of inflammation caused by virus-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns is unknown.
Building on our preliminary data showing the regulation of lung inflammation by a unique neuro-immune circuit,
the overall goals of this project are to precisely determine the role of vagal afferent neurons, the neuro-immune
circuitry, signaling used, and how immune cell function is regulated.
By using complementary and unique tools, the role of vagal afferent neurons and the processes these neurons
evoke to suppress lung inflammation will be determined. To achieve this, we will use selective activation of
vagal afferent neurons, perform identification of lung-specific vagal afferents, and confirm the role of β2AR and
the source of catecholamines that regulate acute lung inflammation induced by a TLR agonist. Finally, we will
assess if this novel anti-inflammatory pathway can be evoked to control inflammation during influenza infection
(SA1). Understanding of the endogenous reflex triggered by lung inflammation will be performed using a
combination of optogenetic silencing of the vagal afferents, pharmacological antagonists, and novel mice with
conditional TLR7 deficiency in vagal afferents, to deduce if neurons sense viral components, and the
mechanisms of immune regulation elicited. Finally, the role of sympathetic lung innervation will be assessed,
and the requirement for specific neurotransmitter receptors tested (SA2). Together, these proposed studies will
decipher the contribution and components of a novel lung anti-inflammatory pathway that limits acute lung
inflammation.","<3,5 cyclic AMP synthetase><Acetylcholine><Acute><Address><Adenyl Cyclase><Adenylate Cyclase><Adenylyl Cyclase><Adrenal Gland Excision><Adrenal Glands><Adrenalectomy><Adrenaline><Adrenals><Adrenergic Antagonists><Adrenergic Blockaders><Adrenergic Blockers><Adrenergic Receptor Antagonists><Adrenergic Receptor Blockaders><Adrenergic-Blocking Agents><Adrenolytic Agents><Adrenolytic Drugs><Adrenolytics><Afferent Neurons><Agonist><Alveolar Macrophages><Anti-Adrenergics><Anti-Inflammatories><Anti-Inflammatory Agents><Anti-adrenergic Agents><Anti-inflammatory><Antiadrenergic Agents><Antiadrenergics><Biologic Models><Biological Models><Body Tissues><Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide><Catecholamine Receptor><Catecholamines><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Signaling><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Cessation of life><Communication><Data><Death><Dependence><Dysfunction><Epinephrine><Functional disorder><Goals><Grippe><Health><Hospitals><Human><Immune><Immune Cell Activation><Immune response><Immune system><Immunes><Immunological response><Immunomodulation><Infection><Inflammation><Inflammatory><Influenza><Injury><Innate Immune Response><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Irritants><KO mice><Knock-out Mice><Knockout Mice><Levarterenol><Levonorepinephrine><Lung><Lung Inflammation><Lung Respiratory System><Lung damage><Macrophage><Mechanical ventilation><Mice><Mice Mammals><Model System><Modern Man><Molecular><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Murine><Mus><Mφ><Nerve><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Nervous System><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neurohumor Receptors><Neuroimmune><Neurologic Body System><Neurologic Organ System><Neuromediator Receptors><Neurons><Neuroregulator Receptors><Neurotransmitter Receptor><Noradrenaline><Norepinephrine><Null Mouse><Organ><Pathogen detection><Pathway interactions><Pattern><Physiology><Physiopathology><Pneumonitis><Process><Production><Pulmonary Body System><Pulmonary Inflammation><Pulmonary Macrophages><Pulmonary Organ System><Receptor Protein><Receptor Signaling><Reflex><Reflex action><Regulation><Respiratory System><Respiratory Tracts><Respiratory tract structure><Role><Sensory><Sensory Neurons><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Source><Subcellular Process><Sympathins><System><T-Cells><T-Lymphocyte><TLR7><TLR7 gene><Testing><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Epinephrine><Tissues><Toll-Like Receptor 7><Trauma><Vagotomy><Viral><Virus><antagonism><antagonist><bacteria pathogen><bacterial pathogen><beta-2 Adrenergic Receptors><biological signal transduction><cholinergic><combat><cytokine><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><flu infection><flu virus infection><health determinants><host response><immune activation><immune modulation><immune regulation><immune system response><immunologic reactivity control><immunomodulatory><immunoregulation><immunoregulatory><immunoresponse><infected with flu><infected with flu virus><infected with influenza><infected with influenza virus><influenza infection><influenza virus infection><injuries><innervation><innovate><innovation><innovative><lung injury><mechanical respiratory assist><mechanically ventilated><mimetics><mortality><nerve supply><neuronal><neurotransmitter release><novel><optogenetics><pathogen><pathogenic bacteria><pathogenic virus><pathophysiology><pathway><pharmacologic><pulmonary><pulmonary damage><pulmonary injury><pulmonary tissue damage><pulmonary tissue injury><receptor><response><restraint><social role><suprarenal gland><thymus derived lymphocyte><tool><viral pathogen><virus pathogen><β-2 Adrenoceptor><β2 Adrenergic Receptor>",Infectious Diseases; Lung; Neurosciences
Effect of IL-21 treatment concurrent to ART and 3HP in Mtb/SIV co-infection,Effect of IL-21 treatment concurrent to ART and 3HP in Mtb/SIV co-infection,"Abstract
The global control of TB is compounded by co-infection with HIV. Those infected with HIV are at high risk of
reactivating latent TB infection (LTBI). Decades of research has not yielded a successful vaccine for the TB/HIV
syndemic. While therapeutics control Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and HIV burden, they have a potential
disadvantage of selecting for resistance and not rescuing from the immune dysfunction. Targeting the host
immune response via a host-directed immunotherapy (HDT) provides an opportunity to augment immunity during
the short-window of acute HIV-1 co-infection of Mtb. Treatment of LTBI in people living with HIV (PLHIV) reduces
the risk of active TB by only 35% and is dependent on the CD4 counts at the time of initiation.
 Though combinatorial antiretroviral therapy (cART) concurrently given with anti-TB therapy improves the
clinical and microbiological parameters, it leads to insufficient reconstitution of protective TH1, TH17 and CD4+ TEM
levels in the lungs and fails to rescue from virus-driven immune activation. Additionally, the long-term sterilization
of bacteria and immune reconstitution in the lungs has not been shown in the individuals treated concurrently
with cART and 3HP. HIV infection depletes IL-21 producing CD4+ T cells and cART only partially restores IL-21
in humans. We hypothesize that supplementing cART and once-weekly, three-month isoniazid and rifapentine
(3HP) treatment with IL-21-IgFc fusion protein in Mtb/SIV co-infection will result in a long-term reconstitution of
TH1 response and functional CD4+T effector memory (TEM) response in the lung. Further, IL-21-IgFc fusion protein
adjunctive to cART and 3HP, will augment cytotoxic function of NK cells, thus significantly reducing the likeliness
of LTBI reactivation in Mtb/SIV co-infection.
 Hence, we aim to explore a HDT that utilizes IL-21-IgFc fusion protein supplementation of cART+3HP
to mitigate virus-driven immune dysregulation and thus reduce incidence of LTBI reactivation. By concurrently
treating Mtb/SIV co-infected macaques with cART+3HP+IL-21-IgFc fusion protein, our goal is to significantly
reduce LTBI reactivation by providing long-term immune reconstitution concurrent to bacterial control by i)
induction of an adequate TH1 response via STAT1, ii) generation of CD4+ TEM cells, iii) maintenance of TH17
responses via STAT3 and iv) promotion of cytotoxic function of NK cells.
 The significance of our novel, translational approach is underscored by our strong preliminary data, and
a reproducible, human-like model system. The data from the proposed study will be critical to the development
of an immune-based intervention along with cART and anti-TB therapy to control dysregulated immune
responses generated during early events of HIV co-infection of LTBI and provide long-term immune

PRC2 independent role of Ezh2 in regulation of basal cell dynamics post-influenza virus infection,PRC2 independent role of Ezh2 in regulation of basal cell dynamics post-influenza virus infection,"Project Summary:
Influenza is a major global health threat causing over half a million deaths each year. Certain virulent strains,
such as H1N1, can cause extensive lung damage, leading to dysplastic repair and the formation of Krt5+ basal
cell pods in the damaged alveolar. Despite their temporary barrier restoration capabilities, these basal cells fall
short in facilitating full tissue repair, resulting in the accumulation of dysplastic tissue and compromised lung
function. The abnormal repair process mirrors patterns seen in chronic lung diseases like idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis (IPF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), accentuating the urgency to understand the
cellular and molecular mechanisms governing lung remodeling and repair. Using mouse models exposed to the
influenza A virus strain PR8, we and others have demonstrated that these nascent basal cells predominantly
originate from a rare subset of migratory airway cells. Furthermore, we found that Enhancer of Zeste 2 (Ezh2) is
marked upregulated in the hyperplastic basal cells post-PR8 infection. Conventionally, Ezh2, as the catalytic
subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), has been recognized for its ability to repress gene
expression via the trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3). However, these basal cells post-PR8
infection showed lower H3K27me3 levels compared to nearby cell types, aligning with low expression of other
PRC2 components like Eed. This implies a potential PRC2-independent function for Ezh2 in controlling basal
cell hyperplasticity. Additionally, Ezh2 deletion in airway epithelial progenitor cells led to marked reduction Krt5+
pod after PR8 infection. Moreover, we also observed a significant upregulation of Sox9 in the hyperplastic basal
cells post-PR8 infection. Sox9 deletion also led to reduction of the Krt5+ pod area mirroring Ezh2 deletion
phenotype after PR8 infection. Furthermore, inhibition of Ezh2 resulted in suppressed Sox9 expression in basal
cells both in vivo and in vitro, suggested Ezh2 may serve as a transcription activator for Sox9. Based on these
data, our central hypothesis is that Ezh2 functions in a PRC2-independent manner to regulate basal cell
dynamics post-PR8 infection. In Aim 1, we will investigate whether the phosphorylation-mediated non-canonical
role of Ezh2 plays a regulatory function in basal cell dynamics following PR8 infection. In Aim2, we will identify
the unique gene targets of non-canonical Ezh2 and ascertain whether Sox9 serves as an integral downstream
effector in basal cells post-PR8 infection. In Aim3, discern the interacting partners external to the PRC2 complex
with which Ezh2 associates to exert its non-canonical role in basal cells post-PR8 infection. Additionally, we seek
to identify the factors that initiate these interactions and changes. Completion of these aims will provide
transformative insights into the mechanisms underpinning lung tissue remodeling post-influenza and the broader
implications for pulmonary medicine.","<Acute><Airway failure><Alveolar><Alveolus><Area><Automobile Driving><Basal Cell><Basal Cell Hyperplasia><Body Tissues><Bronchial Alveolus><COPD><Catalytic Core><Catalytic Domain><Catalytic Region><Catalytic Site><Catalytic Subunit><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Growth in Number><Cell Multiplication><Cell Proliferation><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cellular Proliferation><Cessation of life><Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease><Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease><Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease><Chronic lung disease><Complex><Data><Death><Enhancers><Exposure to><Fibrosing Alveolitis><Gene Down-Regulation><Gene Expression><Gene Inactivation><Gene Silencing><Gene Targeting><Goals><Grippe><H1N1><H1N1 Virus><Histones><Human><Hyperplasia><Hyperplastic><IL-22><In Vitro><Infection><Influenza><Influenza A><Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype><Influenza A virus><Influenza Viruses Type A><Influenzavirus A><Initiation Factors><Injury><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><L-Lysine><L-Serine><Lung><Lung Diseases><Lung Parenchyma><Lung Respiratory System><Lung Tissue><Lung damage><Lysine><Mediating><Methylation><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Molecular><Murine><Mus><Orthomyxovirus Type A><Pathogenesis><Pattern><Peptide Initiation Factors><Phenotype><Phosphorylation><Play><Pneumology><Pneumonology><Pod cells><Polycomb><Process><Proliferating><Protein Phosphorylation><Proteins><Pulmonary Diseases><Pulmonary Disorder><Pulmonary Medicine><Pulmonology><Regulation><Replication Process><Replication-Associated Process><Research><Respiratory Epithelium><Respiratory Failure><Role><Serine><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Specific qualifier value><Specified><Structure of parenchyma of lung><Structure of respiratory epithelium><Testing><Tissues><Transcription Activator><Transcription Coactivator><Transcription Factor Coactivator><Transcription Repression><Transcriptional Activator><Transcriptional Activator/Coactivator><Transcriptional Coactivator><Transcriptional Repression><Translation Initiation Factor><Translational Initiation Factor><Type A Influenza><Up-Regulation><Upregulation><Viral Respiratory Tract Infection><Virulent><acute infection><airway epithelium><biological signal transduction><cell behavior><cell type><cellular behavior><chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder><chronic pulmonary disease><cytokine><diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis><disease of the lung><disorder of the lung><driving><epithelial progenitor><epithelial progenitor cell><epithelial stem cell><flu infection><flu serotype><flu strain><flu subtype><flu viral strain><flu virus infection><flu virus strain><gene repression><global health><idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis><improved><in vivo><infected with flu><infected with flu virus><infected with influenza><infected with influenza virus><influenza infection><influenza serotype><influenza strain><influenza subtype><influenza viral strain><influenza virus infection><influenza virus strain><injuries><injury and repair><insight><interleukin-22><loss of function><lung disorder><lung function><lung injury><lung repair><lung tissue repair><migration><mouse model><murine model><pulmonary><pulmonary damage><pulmonary function><pulmonary injury><pulmonary repair><pulmonary tissue damage><pulmonary tissue injury><repair><repaired><respiratory tract epithelium><response><restoration><social role><tissue repair><transcription co-activator><transcriptional co-activator><transcriptional silencing><viral respiratory infection>",Biodefense and Related Countermeasures; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Influenza; Lung; Pneumonia and Influenza; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human
Combination Adjuvants to Program Durable Immunity to Respiratory Viral and Fungal Pathogens,Combination Adjuvants to Program Durable Immunity to Respiratory Viral and Fungal Pathogens,"ABSTRACT: Pre-existing T cell responses have been correlated with decreased disease severity and positive
clinical outcomes during the influenza pandemic of 2009 and the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore,
diversifying T cell responses, particularly targeting conserved internal viral proteins such as the influenza virus
nucleoprotein (NP), could confer protection against both epidemic and pandemic strains of influenza A virus
(IAV). We have designed a mosaic nucleoprotein (MNP) composed of 9-mer epitopes derived from the complete
set of 7,422 NP sequences from human, swine, and avian IAVs. We have strong evidence that a vaccine
formulation consisting of MNP and a combination adjuvant (Adjuplex + TLR-4 agonist glucopyranosyl lipid A
[GLA]) elicits T cell responses that protect against epidemic and pandemic strains of influenza A virus in mice.
Avian influenza viruses have decimated poultry in the US and many parts of the world, and most concerningly,
these viruses have spilled over to infect multiple mammalian species, including cats and cows. Most notably, the
H5N1 avian influenza virus in cows is rapidly spreading to multiple states in the US. Currently, there is serious
concern about the possibility of the rapidly spreading avian influenza virus in cows mutating to gain the potential
to infect humans, cause severe disease, and efficiently spread by airborne transmission. Therefore, it is critical
to develop vaccine strategies to protect humans, and contain avian influenza virus infection and transmission in
cows. Significantly, the MNP we generated exhibits close homology to the NP of the H5N1 virus affecting dairy
cows in the ongoing outbreak. We hypothesize that the MNP will be immunogenic and that T cell responses
elicited by the MNP-based vaccine will provide effective protection against the currently circulating strains of
avian influenza virus isolated from cows.
The aims of this administrative supplement are: (1) Test the hypothesis that mosaic nucleoprotein (MNP)
formulated in the combination adjuvants (Adjuplex+GLA or Adjuplex+CdN) will elicit diverse antibody and T cell
responses in circulation and mammary gland of ferrets and cows; (2) Test the hypothesis that mosaic
nucleoprotein (MNP) formulated in the combination adjuvants (Adjuplex+GLA or Adjuplex+CdN) will protect
ferrets against H5N1 in lungs, upper respiratory tract, and the mammary gland. The proposed studies will have
implications in the development of effective vaccines to protect humans against avian influenza, break the
transmission cycle in cows and mitigate spillover into humans.","<Adjuvant><Administrative Supplement><Affect><Agonist><Animals><Antibodies><Antigenic Determinants><Avian Influenza><Avian Influenza A Virus><Avian Influenza Virus><Avian Orthomyxovirus Type A><Binding Determinants><Bird Flu><Bird Flu vaccine><Bovine Species><COVID crisis><COVID epidemic><COVID pandemic><COVID-19 crisis><COVID-19 epidemic><COVID-19 era><COVID-19 global health crisis><COVID-19 global pandemic><COVID-19 health crisis><COVID-19 pandemic><COVID-19 period><COVID-19 public health crisis><COVID-19 years><Cats><Cats Mammals><Cattle><Circulation><Clinical><Dairying><Development><Disease><Disease Outbreaks><Disorder><Domestic Cats><Domestic Fowls><Epidemic><Epitopes><Exhibits><Feline Species><Felis catus><Felis domestica><Felis domesticus><Felis sylvestris catus><Ferrets><Fowl Pest><Fowl Plague><Fowl Plague Virus><H5N1><H5N1 virus><Human><Immunity><Influenza A><Influenza A H5N1><Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype><Influenza A virus><Influenza Vaccines><Influenza Virus><Influenza Viruses Type A><Influenzavirus A><Lipid A><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Mammary gland><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Murine><Mus><Mutate><Myxovirus pestis galli><Nucleoproteins><Orthomyxovirus Type A><Outbreaks><Outcome><Poultry><SARS-CoV-2 epidemic><SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis><SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic><SARS-CoV-2 pandemic><SARS-coronavirus-2 epidemic><SARS-coronavirus-2 pandemic><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 epidemic><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 pandemic><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic><Severity of illness><T cell response><Testing><Transmission><Type A Influenza><Upper respiratory tract><Vaccine Antigen><Vaccines><Viral Gene Products><Viral Gene Proteins><Viral Proteins><Virus><avian flu><avian flu vaccine><avian flu virus><avian influenza H5N1><avian influenza H5N1 virus><avian influenza vaccine><avian strains of influenza><bird flu virus><bovid><bovine><coronavirus disease 2019 crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic><coronavirus disease 2019 global health crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic><coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic><coronavirus disease 2019 public health crisis><coronavirus disease crisis><coronavirus disease epidemic><coronavirus disease pandemic><coronavirus disease-19 global pandemic><coronavirus disease-19 pandemic><cow><cross reactivity><design><designing><develop a vaccine><develop vaccines><development of a vaccine><developmental><disease severity><flu infection><flu vaccine><flu virus infection><flu virus pandemic><flu virus vaccine><fungal pathogen><fungi pathogen><immunogenic><infected with flu><infected with flu virus><infected with influenza><infected with influenza virus><influenza in birds><influenza infection><influenza virus infection><influenza virus pandemic><influenza virus vaccine><influenzavirus><mosaic><novel><pandemic flu><pandemic influenza><pandemic strain of influenza><pathogenic fungus><pathogenic virus><porcine influenza><programs><pulmonary><respiratory><severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global health crisis><severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic><swine influenza><transmission process><upper airway tract><vaccine against avian influenza><vaccine against flu><vaccine against influenza><vaccine development><vaccine formulation><vaccine strategy><viral pathogen><viral transmission><virus pathogen><virus protein><virus transmission>",Biodefense and Related Countermeasures; Biotechnology; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Influenza; Lung; Pneumonia and Influenza; Prevention; Vaccine Related
Pre-Clinical Evaluation of IRE1beta as a Novel Therapeutic Target for Cystic Fibrosis Airway Mucus Production,Pre-Clinical Evaluation of IRE1beta as a Novel Therapeutic Target for Cystic Fibrosis Airway Mucus Production,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) lungs exhibit mucoinflammatory responses soon after birth, likely triggered by viral
infections and/or aspiration. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes bronchiolitis leading to airway muco-
obstruction in young CF children, who exhibit increases in MUC5B and MUC5AC mucins in their airways.
Because no treatments are available for CF airway mucus overproduction, there is a clear unmet medical need
for therapies that target mucin synthesis in CF airways. CF airway epithelial inflammation triggers endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress and activates the inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), which exists in two isoforms, α and
β. IRE1α is ubiquitous, but IRE1β is only expressed in mucous cells of the respiratory and GI tracts. We have
shown that IRE1β (but not IRE1α) is required for airway mucin production. IRE1 is an ER transmembrane protein
with a lumenal domain (sensor of unfolded proteins) and a cytoplasmic domain (effector) with kinase and RNase
activities. It is unknown whether the IRE1 lumenal domain senses unfolded mucins and whether its cytoplasmic
domains mediate mucin production; however, our previous studies suggested that mucin production triggers ER
stress and activates IRE1β kinase-induced RNase activation. Because the activated IRE1 RNase splices the
mRNA of X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1s), a transcription factor that up-regulates mucin production, this may
provide a mechanism for CF airway epithelial mucin overproduction. In non-mucous cells, IRE1 kinase activates
JNK, p38 MAP kinase and NF-B via protein interactions, but it is unknown whether the IRE1 kinase activates
these pathways, which are relevant to CF airways because they can promote mucin production. Our preliminary
data indicate that IRE1β, MUC5AC and MUC5B levels are up-regulated in native CF human airways and in
freshly isolated CF human distal airway epithelia. Over-expression of wild type IRE1 in primary human bronchial
epithelia (HBE) increased mucin production, whereas over-expression of IRE1 mutants that lack kinase and/or
RNase activities decreased mucin production. IL-1 and TNF, predominant CF airway cytokines, differently
affected XBP-1s (only IL-1 increased XBP-1s) and mucin production (IL-1 > TNF) in HBE, suggesting that
they up-regulate mucin production via IRE1β RNase-dependent and independent mechanisms. KIRA6, an IRE1
kinase + RNase inhibitor, blunted IL-1-increased XBP-1s and mucins in CF HBE. Notably, a combination of
CFTR modulators (VX-445, VX-661 and VX-770) had no effect on mucin production. RSV infection of HBE
increased XBP-1s and mucin production/secretion, and these responses were blunted by KIRA6. Finally, murine
parainfluenza virus type 1-infected mice developed viral bronchiolitis and airway muco-obstruction, modeling the
bronchiolitis in CF infants infected by RSV. Our aims will test the role of IRE1β protein domains in CF airway
cytokine-increased mucin production in CF HBE. We will also evaluate the therapeutic effect of IRE1β inhibition
on respiratory virus infection-induced mucin production in CF HBE and murine airways, including a CF mouse.
Our studies may lead to the generation of IRE1β inhibitors as novel therapeutics for CF airway muco-obstruction.",<(TNF)-α><0-11 years old><Address><Affect><Airway Disease><Alimentary Canal><Amino

Investigation of within Household Transmission of Influenza in Low-Resource Settings,Investigation of within Household Transmission of Influenza in Low-Resource Settings,"Abstract:
Seasonal influenza causes a significant burden of disease in low-middle income countries, specifically in some
of the most vulnerable populations such as infants, pregnant women, and the elderly. Influenza spreads
primarily within households and while this has been extensively studied in the high-income countries, there
remains a significant gap in the literature around household transmission of influenza in low-middle income
countries. Differences in population structure, household membership, vaccine availability, and contact
patterns make it difficult to apply knowledge from high to low-middle income countries. Understanding
household transmission of influenza in this setting will help to generate key epidemiologic parameters of
influenza such as secondary attack rate and help to model potential interventions to decrease transmission.
This K23 offers an outstanding opportunity to leverage respiratory and serologic samples from a household-
based cohort with self-reported and sensor-based social contact data who were followed prospectively for any
respiratory illness in three low-middle income countries: Guatemala, Mozamique, India. Our approach will be to
use established molecular techniques including hemagglutination inhibition assay and RT-PCR to calculate
seroprevalence curves, the force of infection, and with-in household secondary attack rates. We will the
develop a heterogenous chain binomial model of within household transmission by incorporating household
contact data and risk of infectious between pairs of individuals in the household. Aim 1 is to quantify the spread
of with-in household transmission of influenza. Aim 2 is to develop a heterogenous chain binomial model of
within household transmission with the hopes of projecting how effective different interventions such as
vaccination and masking are in mitigating intra-household influenza transmission. To complete this project, I
will require additional training in infectious disease modeling, advanced methods in infectious disease
quantification, influenza epidemiology and emerging infectious diseases. To help ensure this projects success,
I am surrounded an international team of experts in influenza epidemiology and infectious disease modeling
with whom I have established relationships. This K23 award would provide the crucial link in my career from

Physics-based characterization of functionally relevant protein conformational dynamics,Physics-based characterization of functionally relevant protein conformational dynamics,"PROJECT SUMMARY
With recent advances in structural biology and supercomputing technology, all-atom molecular dynamics
(MD) simulation technique has gained momentum as a prominent tool for the study of protein structural
dynamics. Brute-force MD, however, is not capable of adequately sampling most functionally relevant
biomolecular processes such as large-scale protein conformational changes. Various approaches have been
developed over the last three decades to address the “timescale gap” that hinders the use of MD in real-
world applications. Free energy calculation methods, enhanced sampling techniques, and path-finding
algorithms are examples of umbrella terms that describe many of these methods. This project specifically
aims at employing, tailoring, and fine-tuning state-of-the-art enhanced sampling and path-finding
algorithms to address important biological and biomedical questions. The overall aim of this project is to
develop and employ robust and practical sampling and analysis protocols to study functionally relevant
conformational changes of various proteins from fibroblast growth factor to coronavirus spike protein. Our
proposed methodological framework specifically takes advantage of (1) robust theoretical formalisms
rooted in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and differential geometry; (2) system-specific enhanced
sampling protocols that are tunable for the specific problem at hand; and (3) and integrative and synergistic
approach to experimental (specifically smFRET) and computational (specifically MD) techniques. Some
of the systems proposed to be studied here include proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters, influenza
hemagglutinin, ATP-binding transporters, coronavirus spike proteins, mechanosensitive channel of large
conductance, membrane insertase YidC, serotonin transporter, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) protein.
The common theme in all of these projects is the large-scale conformational changes involved in the
function of these proteins. The successful use of the methodology proposed in this project will allow the
characterization of these conformational changes at the molecular level and pave the groundwork for the
routine application of state-of-the-art enhanced sampling techniques in the study of real world biological
problems.",<5HT transporter><5HTT protein><Address><Algorithms><Binding><Biological><CoV S protein><CoV glycoprotein S><CoV spike glycoprotein><CoV spike protein><Computing Methodologies><Coronavirus glycoprotein S><Coronavirus spike protein><Coupled><DNA Synthesis Factor><Endothelial Cell Growth Factor><FGF><Fibroblast Growth Factor><Fibroblast Growth Factor Gene Family><Fibroblast Growth Regulatory Factor><Free Energy><Growth Agents><Growth Factor><Growth Substances><H+ element><Hand><Human><Hydrogen Ions><Influenza HA><Influenza Hemagglutinin><Membrane><Methodology><Methods><Modern Man><Molecular><Molecular Configuration><Molecular Conformation><Molecular Dynamics Simulation><Molecular Interaction><Molecular Stereochemistry><Oligopeptides><Physics><Play><Process><Protein Conformation><Proteins><Proteins Growth Factors><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Protons><Role><Sampling><Statistical Mechanics><Supercomputing><System><Techniques><Technology><biologic><computational methodology><computational methods><computer based method><computer methods><computing method><conformation><conformational><conformational state><conformationally><conformations><coronavirus S protein><coronavirus spike glycoprotein><differential geometry><flu HA><flu hemagglutinin><hands><influenza viral HA><influenza viral hemagglutinin><influenza virus HA><influenza virus hemagglutinin><membrane structure><molecular dynamics><protein function><real world application><serotonin transporter><single-molecule FRET><single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer><smFRET><social role><sodium-dependent serotonin transporter><structural biology><super computing><symplectic geometry><tool>,Bioengineering; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD)
"Motivate, Vaccinate, Activate’: An effectiveness-implementation trial to assess the impact of a multi-component community-based intervention to increase RSV vaccine uptake among Latino older adults","Motivate, Vaccinate, Activate’: An effectiveness-implementation trial to assess the impact of a multi-component community-based intervention to increase RSV vaccine uptake among Latino older adults","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) causes a substantial burden of hospitalizations and deaths among older
adults, comparable to that of influenza. The new and effective RSV vaccines have the potential to dramatically
reduce RSV morbidity and mortality, yet their full public health impact will not be realized if the racial and ethnic
disparities in RSV vaccine uptake mirror those observed in other respiratory virus-vaccines, from COVID-19 to
influenza. We have the opportunity to adapt community-based interventions from the COVID-19 pandemic to
proactively address disparities in RSV vaccine uptake. However, evidence-based data, conducted in
partnership with impacted communities, are essential.
This project will focus on increasing RSV vaccine uptake among Latinos, a community disproportionatly
affected by respiratory vaccines and RSV. We will leverage our well-established community-academic
partnership, Unidos en Salud, to adapt two components of our ‘Motivate, Vaccinate, Activate’ intervention—
CHW counseling and text message nudges. This multi-component intervention was originally designed to
increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake among Latinos and to activate people to recommend vaccination to people
in one’s social network. Our overall study objective is to adapt this intervention to inform effective and
customizable community-based strategies to increase RSV vaccine uptake. In addition to a rigorous
randomized trial design, we will collect detailed implementation outcomes to aide in generalizability and
adaption to other vaccines and settings. Our primary hypothesis is that language-and culturally-concordant
CHW motivation and activation counseling sessions, coupled with text message nudges, will increase RSV
vaccine confidence by adressing trust, knowledge, and access-related barriers. The proposed study has three
aims. In Aim 1 we will use the ADAPT-IT framework to adapt two intervention components: CHW counseling
and text-message nudges to increase RSV vaccine uptake among Latino older adults (>60 years) (Aim 1a)
and enable younger adults (18-50 years old) to discuss RSV vaccination with older adults in their social and
family networks (Aim 1b). Then in Aim 2 we will conduct a two-arm type-1 effectiveness implementation trial to
determine the effectiveness and implementation of a CHW counseling and text-message intervention on RSV
vaccine uptake in Latino adults >60 years. In Aim 3, using a parallel trial design and social network analytic
techniques, we will test the effectiveness of CHW counseling and text-message nudges on activating Latino
adults to discuss RSV vaccination with the older adults within their social networks.
The proposed work will provide timely, rigorous, and adaptable data to directly inform community-based
approaches to increase RSV vaccination. In addition to providing timely data to reduce RSV vaccine
disparities, these data will also advance our scientific understanding of the effectiveness of text-messages from
community-based organizations and community-based interventions aimed at activating cross-generational
social networks to boost vaccine uptake.","<2-arm trial><2019-nCoV vaccine><21+ years old><Acute respiratory infection><Address><Adoption><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><COVID crisis><COVID

Regulation of viral-bacterial co-infections by immunometabolism,Regulation of viral-bacterial co-infections by immunometabolism,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major respiratory pathogen in the pathogenesis of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and the
ineffective immune response to this pathogen is thought to cause the majority of the lung damage characteristic
of this disease. In the later stages of CF, P. aeruginosa reside in biofilm communities in the lung, accounting for
their resistance to antibiotic therapies. To date, little is known about host factors that promote the transition of P.
aeruginosa from acute to chronic infection in CF. CF patients show a reduced ability to clear P. aeruginosa
acquired during respiratory viral infections and frequently new pseudomonal colonization in people with CF
follows a respiratory viral infection. We have shown that virus co-infection, and the subsequent antiviral interferon
response, promote biofilm conversion by P. aeruginosa. Interferon has potent antiviral activity, but in addition,
interferon stimulated gene (ISG) effector functions have been reported to promote pathogen replication,
suggesting that pathogens have evolved to subvert and even benefit from the interferon response. Decades of
research demonstrate metabolic reprogramming as part of the host response to acute viral infections, with
induction of aerobic glycolysis being a common observation. Our preliminary data suggest that the innate antiviral
immune response through IFN signaling induces aerobic glycolysis during RSV infection, while still maintaining
oxidative phosphorylation in the respiratory epithelium. Using an improved model to culture P. aeruginosa
biofilms in association with human CF airway epithelial cells and a RSV mouse infection model, we will examine
mechanisms by which antiviral interferon signaling promotes biofilm conversion by P. aeruginosa through a
mechanism of metabolic reprogramming. To this end, we will determine how metabolic reprogramming of the
respiratory epithelium facilitates viral-bacterial co-infection, define how secreted metabolic products from the
virus-infected respiratory epithelium promote P. aeruginosa persistence and chronic infection by impairing
antibacterial function in recruited macrophages and promoting bacterial biofilm growth. Our goal is to elucidate
the molecular mechanism for virus-stimulated bacterial biofilms and thus, identify new targets that could delay
acquisition and chronic bacterial colonization, or work in conjunction with existing therapies, to eradicate P.
aeruginosa in CF patients.",<Accounting><Active Oxygen><Acute><Airway examination><Anti-Bacterial Agents><Anti-viral Response><Antibiotic Resistance><Antibiotic Therapy><Antibiotic Treatment><Arbitrating><Arbitration><Bacterial Infections><Bioavailability><Biogenesis><Biologic Models><Biological Availability><Biological Models><Bronchiectasis><CF airway><CF airway epithelia><CF lung disease><CF patients><COPD><Cancers><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Protection><Cell Signaling><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Characteristics><Chronic><Chronic Disease><Chronic Illness><Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease><Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease><Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease><Cystic Fibrosis><Cytoprotection><Data><Development><Disease><Disorder><Dysfunction><Environment><Epithelial Cells><Epithelium><Fe element><Fostering><Functional disorder><Generalized Growth><Genes><Goals><Growth><HIF 1 alpha><HIF-1alpha><HIF1-Alpha><HIF1A><HIF1A gene><HIF1α><Hexose Monophosphate Shunt><Host Factor><Host Factor Protein><Human><IFN><Immune><Immune response><Immunes><Immunochemical Immunologic><Immunologic><Immunological><Immunological response><Immunologically><Immunologics><Impairment><In Vitro><Infection><Influenza A><Influenza A virus><Influenza Viruses Type A><Influenzavirus A><Integration Host Factors><Interferons><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Iron><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Lung damage><MOP1><Macrophage><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Mediating><Metabolic><Mice><Mice Mammals><Microbial Biofilms><Microbial Physiology><Model System><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><Morbidity><Morbidity -

Optimizing mRNA sequences with deep neural networks,Optimizing mRNA sequences with deep neural networks,"The COVID-19 pandemic has presented new challenges to individuals world-wide. Since the first reports of
infections in the US more than 90 million individuals have become infected and more than 1 million have died.
SARS-CoV-2 genome has various open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs), 4
structural proteins and several accessory proteins. The genome of RNA virus can easily generate mutations as
virus spreads. The constant emergence of new mutations in SARS-CoV-2 is the major challenge for the ongoing
development of antiviral drug and broad neutralizing antibodies. The two mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech
and Moderna are moderate effective, 45 to 75 percent at protecting people from in preventing infection from the
delta variant, and both of them have received emergency use authorization. More seriously, the omicron variant
was first detected in southern Africa and quickly expanded to the whole world. According to a recent study,
traditional dosing regimens of COVID-19 vaccines available in the US do not produce antibodies capable of
recognizing and neutralizing the Omicron variant. The global data shows the coronavirus pandemic is far from
over. Thus, more variants are expectable and some of them may escape the immune response produced after
vaccination. How to keep the efficacy of existing mRNA vaccines on variants is challenging us. Aside from SARS-
CoV-2, mRNA medicines against cancer and other infectious disease, such as Ebola, Zika virus, and influenza,
are advancing through clinical trials.
 The goal of this project is to develop an integrated deep learning model to optimize 5'UTR, codon usage, and
3'UTR at same time that enables users to design the optimal mRNA sequence to enhance protein expression
level, thus to improve the efficacy of mRNA medicines. mRNA medicines hold great promise for the treatment of
a wide variety of disease, extending from prophylactics to therapeutics for infectious diseases, cancer, and
genetic disease. mRNA medicines have several beneficial features: safety, efficacy, production, and speed.
Multiple factors are involved to regulate the stability and efficiency of mRNA, including 5' untranslated region
(UTR), 3' UTR, codon et al, and several in silico approaches have being developed to optimize these factors
respectively However, as these factors always function together during the translation of mRNA, and individual
optimization is insufficient. Thus, a novel integrated deep learning model for these factors is needed to
comprehensively enhance the stability and efficiency of mRNA medicine. In silico optimization of mRNA vaccine
provides a fast methodology to investigate all possible integration of the ORF, 5' UTR and 3'UTR and identify
the optimal mRNA vaccine. The interdisciplinary team proposed to develop the following aims: (1) developing
deep learning models for 5' UTR, codon, and 3' UTR respectively, and integrated model for systemic optimization
of 5' UTR, codon, and 3' UTR; and (2) experimentally validate the integrated models by designing the 5'UTR,
codon, and 3'UTR sequence for representative.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><2019-nCoV vaccine><2019-nCoV variant><2019-nCoV variant forms><2019-nCoV variant strains><3'

SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in patients with lymphoma,SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in patients with lymphoma,"Project Summary
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (NHL/CLL) patients have immune system deficits
that arise from the cancer and are aggravated by lymphoma therapies, placing them at higher risk of morbidity
and mortality after infection with viruses like influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). Patients are strongly recommended to get vaccinated and boosted with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA
vaccines, but antibody responses after vaccination in these patients are often impaired. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines
also elicit T cell responses in healthy individuals that may be protective but previous studies indicate that T cells
from NHL/CLL patients are also dysfunctional.
Under the mentorship of Drs. Rafi Ahmed and Jonathon Cohen, I have assembled a cohort of over 600 NHL/CLL
patients with over 1,300 longitudinal blood samples paired with clinical data that I have used to study the immune
responses in this patient population. Using this cohort, I showed that most patients have lower antibody
responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination than otherwise healthy individuals and that antibody responses
correlate at least partly with lymphoma therapies. I have also shown that some patients produce spike-specific
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after vaccination. The longitudinal, antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses
after vaccination and infection have not been well characterized in NHL/CLL patients. I hypothesize that these
patients have alterations in their CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses after antigen stimulation, which are dependent
on the underlying lymphoma subtype and lymphoma therapy.
This proposal has 3 goals: 1) To evaluate the generation, differentiation, breadth, and persistence of SARS-
CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell responses in NHL/CLL patients after vaccination and infection using functional
assays and single cell sequencing technologies; 2) To define the primary and memory SARS-CoV-2-specific
CD8+ T cell responses after vaccination and infection through functional assays and single cell sequencing
technologies; and 3) to support my transition from a trainee in Dr. Ahmed’s laboratory to leading an independent
research program.
Successful completion of these studies will provide in-depth knowledge of the generation, evolution, breadth,
and persistence of antigen-specific T cell responses in NHL/CLL patients after vaccination and infection. This
knowledge will facilitate the design of interventions that may improve vaccine responses in these and other
immunosuppressed patients, protecting them from potentially life-threatening viral infections like SARS-CoV-2
and influenza. Moreover, the insights on the generation and maintenance of adaptive immune responses against
novel antigens obtained from these studies could help fuel the development of better cancer immunotherapies.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><2019-nCoV vaccine><ATAC

"Characterization and optimization of single dose, thermostable and durable vaccine platform towards increased clinical acceptance","Characterization and optimization of single dose, thermostable and durable vaccine platform towards increased clinical acceptance","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Broadening the spectrum of vaccine platforms that confer protective, durable and broad immunogenicity is
important for pandemic preparedness. Here, we aim to create essential preclinical data to characterize a novel
genetic vaccine platform called PARVAX to increase its clinical acceptance. Our previous studies show that a
single dose of PARVAX candidates for COVID-19 elicits sustained humoral immunity, near-sterilizing upper
and lower airway protection from a SARS-CoV-2 challenge, and potent and durable cellular responses. These
qualities combined with established commercial and low-cost manufacturing processes, make this platform
imminently feasible, scalable and affordable for vaccine applications. In this proposal, we will investigate the
mechanism behind the potency and durability of PARVAX, which we hypothesize is correlated with antigen
expression kinetics (Aim 1). We also use rational engineering approaches to enhance the potency of the
PARVAX platform, which will enhance safety and applicability for other pathogens (Aim 2). Finally, we propose
to generate proof of the potency of PARVAX as a vaccine platform beyond COVID-19 by exploring the serum
and mucosal immunity and protection from influenza viruses in two preclinical models of influenza infection
(Aim 3). The proposed work is highly relevant for pandemic preparedness, since it will enable the rapid design
of new and preclinically derisked PARVAX candidates for existing and future pathogens, and has the potential
to provide clarity on the means to improve the durability, breadth and mucosal immunity of other platforms.","<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><Address><Adeno-Associated

Enhancing Virology Training of Underrepresented Minority Students through Summer Research,Enhancing Virology Training of Underrepresented Minority Students through Summer Research,"ABSTRACT
 Diversifying the biomedical workforce is a priority of the US government scientific funding agencies. To
fulfill these priorities, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other minority serving institutions
have continued to play an outsized role in training underrepresented minority (URM) students. Specifically,
Meharry Medical College (MMC) has been a leader in training URM students in basic, translational, and clinical
research. Our graduate, medical and dental students are often first-generation college students, and first from
their community to pursue training in biomedical research. Importantly, our trainees are role models for the next
generation and often mentor and educate URM students post-graduation. Consistent with our history of providing
care to the underserved since 1876, MMC is playing a vital role in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. As
evident with other infectious diseases, COVID-19 disproportionally affects minority health, specifically African
Americans and Hispanics. A key strategy to combat these evolving pathogens is to train the next generation of
virologists from diverse backgrounds. The urgent need for a diverse workforce in virology is acutely felt during
the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that has ravaged the World and disproportionately affected the minority
population in the US. Furthermore, increasing the number of virologists from URM backgrounds is also critical
to fight against deadly diseases caused by viruses such as HIV, Influenza, Ebola, and others. To address this
unmet need, we propose the “Enhancing Virology Training (ENVIT) through Summer Research” program.
The goal of this program is to prepare and increase the number of URM students in virology-focused
careers. This 10-week program will provide an intensive research experience for graduate, medical and dental
students. A local, regional, and nationwide recruitment strategy will be employed to attract URM students. We
will provide classroom teaching and hands-on laboratory training in basic virology, lectures/seminars on career-
development, scientific writing, communications skills and networking. Each student will work under the
mentorship of a faculty mentor from Meharry Medical College (MMC) and/or Vanderbilt University Medical Center
(VUMC) on a research project that focused on virology. The participants will attend seminars that allow
interactions with virologists and expose students to career opportunities in virology. The program will end with a
one-day Virology Mini-Symposium where students will showcase their research. This mini-symposium will also
feature a keynote lecture from a national/international leader from the virology field. Finally, the ENVIT program
will track the career path of participants to evaluate the extent to which program goals were met, and identify
areas for improvement. Evaluations from research mentors will also be used to assess and improve the program.
These focused research experiences and career development activities will meaningfully increase engagement
of URM students in the area of virology and diversify the biomedical workforce specifically needed to fight the
existing and emerging viral pathogens.",<2019-nCoV vaccine><AIDS><AIDS Virus><Academic Medical Centers><Acquired Immune Deficiency><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome><Acquired Immune Deficiency

"The innate antiviral response in airway epithelium: a cell type-resolved, functional genomics approach","The innate antiviral response in airway epithelium: a cell type-resolved, functional genomics approach","PROJECT SUMMARY
Beyond its role in conducting the air required for respiration, the airway epithelium plays a critical role in host
defense through its physical and immunological properties. Specialized secretory cells present in the epithelium
secrete airway mucins, which form a viscous hydrogel protecting the epithelial surface, and the coordinated
beating of multiciliated cells propels this surface liquid and trapped foreign material away from the lower airways.
TP63+ airway basal cells serve as the progenitor cell to replenish all other epithelial cell populations. Additional
rare cell types with as-of-yet incompletely defined functions include FOXI1+ ionocytes and POU2F3+ tuft-like
cells. All epithelial cell types constitute a selectively permeable physical barrier by forming cell-cell junctions with
neighboring cells, such that an electrochemical gradient can be maintained across epithelial boundary. Besides
these physical functions, airway epithelial cells participate in both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms
through pathogen sensing, release of cytokines, and crosstalk with immune cells. The type I interferon (IFN-I)
response is a broad-spectrum, first-line innate immune defense against viruses. While traditionally viewed as
relatively uniform across cell types, preliminary data from our lab and collaborators show that IFN-I induces
distinct gene expression programs across airway cell types, hinting at possible functional heterogeneity in the
IFN-I response on a per-cell type basis. However, it is unclear whether these altered gene expression patterns
and associated transcriptional regulators have functional significance in the context of respiratory virus infection.
A diverse group of respiratory viruses infect the airway epithelium, including influenza viruses, rhinoviruses,
“common-cold” coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2. These can be important triggers for acute exacerbations of
chronic airway disease states. The proposed project will develop state-of-the-art CRISPRa/i functional genomics
approaches to perturb IFN-induced regulators and effectors of innate immunity in a human, physiologically
relevant model of the human airway epithelium. This will enable precise functional profiling of the IFN-I response
in individual airway epithelial cell types. Altogether, this work will shed light on how the airway epithelium functions
as an integrated unit to mediate host defense against respiratory viruses and strike a balance between effective
host defense and immune homeostasis (using influenza A virus as a clinically relevant model respiratory
pathogen), with the ultimate goal of developing novel host-directed antiviral therapeutic strategies. More
generally, I anticipate the proposed experimental system developed here will be broadly valuable for precise
genetic characterization of other airway disease states and their interaction with respiratory virus infection,
including COPD, cystic fibrosis, and asthma. This project also presents a unique opportunity for training in both
experimental and computational research approaches relevant to airway biology and respiratory virus infection.",<(IFN) α><(IFN)-α><(IFN)α><2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel

Multi-center Evaluation of the Threat of Established and Emerging Respiratory Viral Infections in Pediatric Transplant Recipients,Multi-center Evaluation of the Threat of Established and Emerging Respiratory Viral Infections in Pediatric Transplant Recipients,"Respiratory viral infections (RVI) have changed the world. RVI are a leading cause of infectious morbidity and
mortality in children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and solid organ transplantation (SOT).
RVI diagnosis by qualitative PCR screening is sensitive, but unfortunately does not distinguish disease from
presence of viral nucleic acid or predict risk for progression from upper to the more severe lower respiratory tract
disease (LRTD). In the COVID-19 era, many centers now use pre-transplant RVI screening, but the implications
of detection in an asymptomatic host are unknown. Integrating quantitative viral load, viral sequencing, and/or
host immune (T cell and antibody) responses could provide novel predictive tools to stratify the risk of developing
an RVI and the progression to LRTD. Our objective is to establish a comprehensive RVI diagnostic and disease
progression predictive model in children undergoing transplantation. We propose a prospective multi-center
epidemiologic study of 2000 pediatric transplant recipients, with a nested case-control immunologic and virologic
substudy. This will be the largest study on RVI in any age group of HCT and SOT recipients. We will leverage
the Pediatric Transplant ID Network (PIDTRAN), a consortium of 21 nationwide sites and the only group
dedicated to pediatric transplant infectious diseases. We will obtain pre-transplant blood and nasal samples in
all 2000 transplant participants at enrollment and also blood at day +100 post-transplant. In Aim 1, we will
determine the prevalence of viral nucleic assay positivity using qualitative PCR and then perform quantitative
PCR (qPCR) and viral sequencing (metagenomics) on positive specimens. We hypothesize that the quantity of
respiratory viral nucleic acid or certain viral genotypes will identify patients at risk for RVI or disease progression.
In Aim 2, we will develop and validate an immunological classifier to predict risk of RVI and progression to LRTD
in a nested substudy focused on three major pediatric viruses: RSV, parainfluenza virus 3, and human
metapneumovirus. We will characterize pre-transplant humoral and cellular immune responses in the subset of
patients who develop those RVIs compared with pre-transplant immunologic and day +100 post-transplant
immune responses from uninfected matched controls. The combination of host response and virologic data
(qPCR and viral metagenomics) will also be compared between RVI cases who do or do not progress to LRTD
to identify biomarkers. We hypothesize that patients with specific qualitative or quantitative antibody responses
and/or specific T cell repertoires to RVI will have superior clinical outcomes. Characterizing a comprehensive
viral and host response pre-transplant, we will learn to predict who is at risk of RVI and LRTD and needs early
intervention vs. delay of transplant, and when PCR positivity is indicative of potential disease. These results will
allow us to generate novel evidence-based pediatric guidelines for personalized clinical management of children
undergoing transplant, and also inform future antiviral and vaccine studies in these high-risk patient populations.","<0-11 years old><2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><Acute

Mechanisms of regulatory T-cell mediated endothelial repair following viral pneumonia in aged hosts,Mechanisms of regulatory T-cell mediated endothelial repair following viral pneumonia in aged hosts,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The broad objectives of this K08 proposal are two-fold: 1) to facilitate development of the necessary skills that
will allow the candidate to achieve her long-term goal of becoming a successful physician-scientist focusing on
determinants of recovery from viral pneumonia in aged hosts, and 2) to investigate the mechanisms that direct
the Tregs to orchestrate resolution of severe lung injury throughout the lifespan. The candidate and her mentors
have designed a detailed training plan tailored to the candidate's specific needs and goals. The plan includes a
rigorous research component that will afford the PI new knowledge and research skills to better examine the
links between a critical immune cell population and the endothelium during recovery from viral pneumonia. The
proposal concerns viral pneumonia, specifically influenza-induced lung injury, its clinical counterpart the acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and how they both disproportionately affect the elderly population. Despite
decades of dedicated research, there are only a few anti-viral therapies with limited efficacy to manage severe
viral pneumonia. Tregs have been shown to decrease inflammation and promote tissue repair in diverse murine
models of lung injury. Tregs also increase in the lungs of patients with ARDS, suggesting that they may play a
role in the human adaptive immune response to lung injury. However, the specific mechanisms that cause Tregs
to execute their pro-repair program following lung injury remain unknown. Our preliminary data shows that the
youthful reparative Treg cell program following influenza-induced lung injury is dominated by biologic processes
linked to the development and repair of blood capillaries. This reparative program is lost in aged hosts in a cell-
autonomous manner. Thus, we hypothesize that aging results in Treg cell-specific downregulation of important
pro-angiogenic factors expression such as VEGFA, leading to impaired alveolar endothelial repair and recovery
from viral pneumonia. The long-term goal of the proposal is to identify novel small molecule- and cell-based
therapeutics to control inflammation and promote tissue repair in our increasingly older population. To test this
hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) determine whether age-related alterations in the pro-
endothelial repair function of Tregs results from cell-autonomous or microenvironmentally-driven changes, 2)
determine whether Treg cell-generated VEFGA is necessary and sufficient to restore the pro-endothelial repair
function present in youth that is lost with aging, and 3) determine whether age-related VEGFA expression in
alveolar Tregs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is associated with 30-day mortality in patients with severe viral
pneumonia. We will use standard techniques to assess severity of lung injury, endothelial repair, heterochronic
(age mis-matched) adoptive Treg cell transfer, multiple transgenic murine strains for loss-of-function and gain-
of-function experiments, flow cytometry, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and transcriptional profiling with
RNA-sequencing as the primary methods to support the experimental design of this proposal.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><ARDS><Acute Lung Injury><Acute Pulmonary

US-Cuba Administrative Supplement to the Viral Immunity and Vaccination (VIVA) Human Immunology Project Consortium,US-Cuba Administrative Supplement to the Viral Immunity and Vaccination (VIVA) Human Immunology Project Consortium,"SUMMARY
Viral Immunity and Vaccination (VIVA) Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) will carry out a
comprehensive program for assessing the dynamic human immune responses to vaccination. The VIVA HIPC
will leverage recent advances in human immune profiling methods to characterize the diverse states of the
human innate immune system before and after vaccination against these infectious diseases using novel
immune phenotyping and genomics strategies that generate data and tools to be used for downstream data
analysis and functional investigations. We will generate human immune profiles and signatures for vaccinations
against SARS-CoV-2 (Project 1), seasonal influenza (Project 2) and dengue viruses (Project 3). We will use
holistic approaches to provide cutting-edge standardized and qualified `omics' assays to assess cellular and
serological Immune responses to vaccinations, genomics/transcriptomics, including scRNAseq, CITEseq and
spatial tissue transcriptomics, and experimental vaccinations in primary human tonsillar histocultures in Projects
1, 2 and 3. We will perform data mining, bioinformatics analyses across data sets, and modeling for integration
of the `omics' datasets to identify the network components and infer their interactions and correlations important
for outcomes. The VIVA HIPC will make the data available for use by the research community and provide the
analyses and immune profiles generated to the scientific community. We will couple our local data infrastructure
to ImmPort to ensure full and timely release of clinical, sample, and experimental meta-data in synchrony with
genomic data releases to standard data repositories. The multi-disciplinary team of investigators with
complementary expertise in viral immunology, viral pathogenesis, vaccinology, genomics and data analysis, will
ensure the success of the VIVA program.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><2019-nCoV vaccine><Administrative Supplement><Airway

Digital Storytelling to Reduce Pediatric Influenza Vaccination Disparities: A Pilot Pragmatic Trial,Digital Storytelling to Reduce Pediatric Influenza Vaccination Disparities: A Pilot Pragmatic Trial,"Project Summary
Every winter, seasonal influenza infects over 10,000,000 US children, hospitalizes 50,000, and kills 300‐500.
Black children are 2‐3 times more likely to get sick, be hospitalized, and die than children of other races and
ethnicities. These disparities are associated with influenza vaccination disparities, which are in turn associated
with historical exploitation, access to care, health illiteracy, and vaccine hesitancy. The long‐term objective of
the candidate, Joshua T.B. Williams, MD, is to reduce vaccination disparities by partnering with minority
stakeholders to co‐create interventions that improve vaccination equity in pragmatic trials. This objective will
further the mission of the National Institutes of Child Health and Development to ensure all children have an
equitable chance to grow and fulfill their potential free from diseases. Dr. Williams is well‐suited for this work
as a general pediatrician with prior health services research training who has received 4 competitive grants
and first‐authored 15 papers on vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, and vaccine‐preventable diseases since 2019.
 To achieve this objective, Dr. Williams will pursue formal coursework, mentored experiential training,
and directed learning in three specific areas: (1) health disparities and disparities research, (2) community
engagement, and (3) implementation science, including the design and conduct of pragmatic trials. To support
him, Dr. Williams has identified a primary mentor with national expertise in vaccine hesitancy, intervention
design, and pragmatic vaccination trials (Dr. Sean T. O'Leary). He has assembled a team of three co‐mentors
with expertise in health disparities (Dr. Romana Hasnain‐Wynia), community engagement (Dr. Donald
Nease), and implementation science (Dr. Amy Huebschmann). Moreover, he has an established partnership
with the Center for African American Health (Ms. Deidre Johnson) and support from 6 other distinguished
experts. Dr. Williams proposes 3 sequential projects that build upon his training goals and prior work, which
uncovered a stakeholder recommendation to improve vaccination confidence through personal stories.
 Digital stories are personal narratives that synthesize images, video, voice, or text to create compelling
accounts of human experience. In pilot pragmatic trials, digital stories have improved hypertension control in
Black adults and increased self‐report of Human Papillomavirus vaccination in Korean women. The 3 specific
aims of this proposal are to (1) explore diverse stakeholders' perceptions of and priorities for a digital
storytelling intervention through qualitative interviews, (2) co‐create a digital storytelling pediatric influenza
vaccination intervention through novel community‐engaged methods, and (3) assess the feasibility,
acceptability, appropriateness, and pilot effectiveness of the intervention in a pragmatic trial involving 200
Black parent‐child dyads in two safety‐net clinics in Denver, CO. The outstanding research environment at the
University of Colorado and Dr. Williams' expert mentorship team will ensure his success, enhance his training,
and advance our understanding of engagement methods and interventions to promote health equity.",<0-11 years old><2 year old><2 years of age><21+ years old><Address><Adult><Adult Human><African

Immune-epithelial progenitor interactions drive age-associated dysplastic lung repair post viral pneumonia,Immune-epithelial progenitor interactions drive age-associated dysplastic lung repair post viral pneumonia,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Respiratory viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality,
accounting for approximately 2 million deaths per year and an even higher healthcare burden during
pandemics. Individuals over the age of 65 in particular, are susceptible to adverse outcomes during acute
respiratory illness. In addition to increased severity of acute disease, aged individuals are at higher risk of
developing chronic pulmonary sequelae – termed “post-acute sequelae of COVID-19” (PASC) in the context of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Depending on the study criteria, 27-80% of convalescents have been found to develop
chronic disease and thus PASC is quickly developing into a major burden on healthcare systems worldwide.
Notably, this phenomenon is not only limited to SARS-CoV-2 and has been reported following several other
respiratory viral infections including influenza, SARS-CoV-1, MERS, RSV and rhinovirus. Increased
susceptibility of aged individuals to chronic pulmonary sequelae and adverse long-term outcomes remains a
consistent feature across all viruses. However, we have limited insight into the age-associated features
responsible for the development and maintenance of chronic pulmonary sequelae following acute viral injury.
Our lab and others have previously reported persistent dysregulation of immune responses following
respiratory viral infections during aging. Long-term maintenance of tissue resident CD8+ memory T- (CD8+ TRM)
cells was found to contribute to chronic pathology in aged lungs. The molecular mechanisms underlying this
pathological activity were previously unknown, but I now present data that CD8+ TRM cells persisting in aged
lungs contribute to impaired alveolar regeneration post viral injury. Upon depletion of CD8+ TRM cells in the
post-acute phase of infection, I observe a reduction in the long-term maintenance of Krt8+ transitional cells –
an intermediate state adopted by alveolar epithelial type 2 (ATII) cells prior to differentiation into ATI cells.
Coupled with the observed increase in ATI cells, these data indicate that CD8+ TRM cells impair the complete
differentiation of Krt8+ transitional cells into mature ATI cells, thereby compromising pulmonary function. I also
found that CD8+ TRM depletion results in reduced IL-1β levels, a cytokine known to regulate Krt8+ transitional
cell activity. Thus, my overall hypothesis is that CD8+ TRM cells persisting in aged lungs following viral
pneumonia contribute to chronic IL-1β release and thus impair Krt8+ transitional cell differentiation to promote
dysplastic lung repair. To address my hypothesis, I propose to 1) determine the contributions of CD8+ TRM cells
persisting in aged lungs to impaired alveolar regeneration and 2) elucidate the pathological mechanisms driven
by CD8+ TRM cells to promote dysplastic repair of aged lungs. Understanding this immune-epithelial progenitor
interaction would deepen our fundamental understanding of the role of the immune system in alveolar
regeneration and lung repair. Moreover, the proposed studies would pave the way for developing therapeutic
strategies to promote functional repair of aged lungs following severe viral pneumonia.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><65 and older><65 or older><65 years of age and older><65 years of age or more><65 years of age or older><65+ years><65+ years old><> 65 years><Accounting><Acute><Acute Disease><Address><Adopted><Aged 65 and Over><Aging><Alveolar><Area><Beta Proprotein Interleukin 1><Bio-Informatics><Bioinformatics><Body Tissues><Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid><CD8><CD8B><CD8B1><CD8B1 gene><COVID-19><COVID-19 infection><COVID-19 virus><COVID-19 virus infection><COVID19 infection><COVID19 virus><CV-19><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Differentiation><Cell Differentiation process><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cessation of life><Chronic><Chronic Disease><Chronic Illness><Co-culture><CoV-2><CoV2><Cocultivation><Coculture><Coculture Techniques><Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019><Coupled><Cytokeratin 8><Data><Data Set><Death><Development><Epithelial Cells><Exhibits><Fibrosis><Genetic><Goals><Grippe><Health Care Systems><Healthcare Systems><Human><IL-1 beta><IL-1 β><IL-1-b><IL-1β><IL1-Beta><IL1-β><IL1B Protein><IL1F2><IL1β><Immune><Immune Diseases><Immune Disorders><Immune Dysfunction><Immune System Diseases><Immune System Disorder><Immune System Dysfunction><Immune System and Related Disorders><Immune response><Immune system><Immunes><Immunodeficiency and Immunosuppression Disorders><Immunologic Diseases><Immunological Diseases><Immunological Dysfunction><Immunological System Dysfunction><Immunological response><Impairment><In Vitro><Individual><Infection><Inflammation><Influenza><Injury><Interleukin 1beta><Interleukin-1 beta><Interleukin-1β><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Kinetics><LYT3><Lung><Lung Alveolar Epithelia><Lung Capacity><Lung Inflammation><Lung Respiratory System><MERS><MERS coronavirus disease><MERS-CoV disease><Macrophage><Maintenance><Mediating><Memory><Mice><Mice Mammals><Middle East Respiratory Syndrome><Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV disease><Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus disease><Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome><Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome CoV disease><Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus disease><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><Morbidity><Morbidity -

The Role of Lymphatic Endothelial Cell- Expressed Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor 1 on Immune Cell Trafficking and Response to Influenza Virus,The Role of Lymphatic Endothelial Cell- Expressed Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor 1 on Immune Cell Trafficking and Response to Influenza Virus,"ABSTRACT
Lymphatic vessels are a critical component of the immune response to pathogens because they transport
leukocytes carrying antigens to lymph nodes (LNs) to facilitate antigen presentation. Now known to actively
shape the innate and adaptive immune responses, lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) express chemokines and
receptors, secrete mediators such as sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and C-C motif ligand 21 (CCL21),
modulate dendritic cell (DC) function, and regulate trafficking of immune cells into LNs. Lymphatic dysfunction
also plays a significant role in many diseases, yet little is known about how lymphatic dysfunction impacts
response to infection. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) is a G-protein coupled receptor highly
expressed on lymphocytes and endothelial cells that is important for angiogenesis, barrier function, and immune
cell trafficking. Others report decreased S1PR1 on lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) is associated with
lymphedema and skewed CD4 T cell activation in mice and humans. Our collaborators in the Srinivasan lab
discovered that mice lacking S1PR1 on LECs (S1pr1ΔLEC mice) have enhanced VEGF receptor 3 (VEGFR3)
signaling that, in multiple organs, leads to increased lymphatic vessel density and spontaneous formation of
tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs), which are organized accumulations of immune cells that form in non-lymphoid
tissues with infection or inflammation. The impact that these altered CD4 T cell responses and aberrant TLOs
found with deficiency of LEC-expressed S1PR1 have on the immune response to infection is unclear. I
hypothesize that, in S1pr1ΔLEC mice with influenza A infection (IAV), increased VEGFR3-mediated
lymphangiogenesis will enhance the lymphatic CCL21 gradient and increase dendritic cell (DC) migration from
the lung to the draining mediastinal lymph node (mLN) and that pulmonary TLO formation will enhance viral
clearance compared to infected controls, but deficient S1PR1 signaling in LECs will alter mLN architecture and
impair generation of B and T lymphocyte memory. To test this, I will infect S1pr1ΔLEC mice with IAV in the following
aims. In aim 1, I will examine viral clearance, lymphatic branching, pulmonary TLO formation, DC migration from
the lungs to the mLN and spleen, and the transcriptome of S1pr1-deficient LECs. To determine whether
phenotypes in S1pr1ΔLEC mice are due to excess VEGFR3, I will also perform these studies in S1pr1ΔLEC mice
with a reduced gene dosage of Vegfr3. In aim 2, I will investigate lymphocyte memory responses in S1pr1ΔLEC
mice with IAV by quantifying antigen-specific T cells and memory B cells, measuring IAV-specific antibodies,
examining mLN architecture, and studying response to challenge IAV infection. Preliminary data from my studies
show S1pr1ΔLEC mice have reduced morbidity, increased pulmonary TLO formation, altered DC migration, and
impaired antibody production following IAV infection. The successful completion of these studies will provide
novel insight into the interactions of immune cells with the lymphatic endothelium during infection and have
implications for development of therapeutics that act on lymphatic pathologies.",<Ab response><Antibodies><Antibody Formation><Antibody Production><Antigen Presentation><Antigen-Presenting Cells><Antigens><Architecture><Autoimmune Diseases><B blood cells><B cell><B cells><B-Cell Subsets><B-Cells><B-Lymphocyte Subsets><B-Lymphocytes><B-cell><Blood Flow Cytometry><Blood leukocyte><Body Tissues><Body Weight decreased><CD4 Cells><CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes><CD4 T cells><CD4 helper T cell><CD4 lymphocyte><CD4+ T-Lymphocyte><CD4-Positive Lymphocytes><Cancers><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Function><Cell Locomotion><Cell Migration><Cell Movement><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Migration><Cellular Motility><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Chemotactic Cytokines><Chronic><Chronic lung disease><Data><Dendritic Cells><Development><Disease><Disorder><Disseminated Sclerosis><Dose><ELISA><Ectopic lymphoid organ><Ectopic lymphoid structure><Edg Receptors><Endothelial Cells><Engineering / Architecture><Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay><FLK1><Flow Cytofluorometries><Flow Cytofluorometry><Flow Cytometry><Flow Microfluorimetry><Flow Microfluorometry><G Protein-Complex Receptor><G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes><G-Protein-Coupled Receptors><GPCR><Gene Copy Number><Gene Dosage><Gene Expression><Generations><Genes><Germinal Center><Homologous Chemotactic Cytokines><Human><Immune><Immune response><Immunes><Immunofluorescence><Immunofluorescence Immunologic><Immunological response><Impairment><Infection><Inflammation><Influenza A><Influenza A virus><Influenza Virus><Influenza Viruses Type A><Influenzavirus A><Innate Immune Response><Intercrines><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><KDR gene><Leukocytes><Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System><Ligands><LoxP-flanked allele><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Lung damage><Lymph Node Reticuloendothelial System><Lymph System><Lymph node proper><Lymphangiogeneses><Lymphangiogenesis><Lymphatic><Lymphatic Endothelial Cells><Lymphatic Endothelium><Lymphatic Network><Lymphatic System><Lymphatic System Reticuloendothelial System><Lymphatic cell><Lymphatic nodes><Lymphedema><Lymphocyte><Lymphocytic><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Marrow leukocyte><Measures><Mediastinal Lymph Node><Mediastinal lymph node group><Mediating><Mediator><Memory><Memory B Cell><Memory B-Lymphocyte><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Morbidity><Morbidity -

Point-of-Care RT-PCR System to Inform COVID-19 and Respiratory Illness Decisions,Point-of-Care RT-PCR System to Inform COVID-19 and Respiratory Illness Decisions,"Project Summary
 The ongoing COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlights the need for simple, rapid, and cost-effective
testing for respiratory infections at the point-of-care, including physician’s offices, urgent-care settings,
ambulatory procedural centers, and low-resource environments. The need is particularly notable for respiratory
infections, such as COVID-19 and influenza, which can present with similar symptoms yet require distinct
management strategies. With its high sensitivity and specificity, RT-PCR is the gold standard for the molecular
diagnosis and differentiation among respiratory pathogens. Traditional RT-PCR workflow requires significant
control over specimen contents and reaction conditions, with current methods requiring nucleic acid extraction
prior to amplification and detection. The net result is increased complexity, cost, and/or turnaround time for
diagnosis. In this context, we have observed in recent influenza studies that outstanding analytic performance
characteristics can be achieved without RNA extraction, by applying our novel workflow and Adaptive PCR
technology. Unlike traditional RT-PCR, Adaptive RT-PCR incorporates mirror-image L-DNA enantiomers—
identical in sequence to PCR primers and targets—that modify cycling conditions to match the biochemical
sample contents, thus eliminating the need to monitor reaction temperature. The direct monitoring of reaction
conditions overcomes many of the limitations of traditional PCR, facilitating direct amplification within the original
specimen matrix, simplifying instrument design, and enabling single-tube analyses.
 SARS-CoV-2 and influenza are both enveloped RNA viruses, with specimens collected in the same
manner (i.e. nasopharyngeal swab) and using the same viral transport medium. Therefore, we hypothesize that
we may eliminate RNA extraction for this virus, like we have done for influenza, by performing Adaptive RT-PCR
directly on clinical specimens. We propose to enable a simplified methodology through Adaptive RT-PCR,
creating diagnostics for COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens without RNA extraction. As a collaboration
between biomedical engineers and a COVID-19 diagnostic laboratory, we seek to develop a workflow and
instrument that are simple-to-use, cost-effective, and suitable for point-of-care settings, tools that can rapidly
inform treatment and management strategies. To achieve this goal, Aim 1 will evaluate the performance of RT-
PCR directly – that is, without RNA extraction – using both traditional and Adaptive RT-PCR instrumentation.
Aim 2 will develop multiplexed amplification reagents to create a sensitive and specific respiratory panel that
detects SARS-CoV-2, four other viruses, two bacteria, and one control target. Ultimately, Aim 3 will design and
fabricate a self-contained Adaptive RT-PCR instrument suitable for point-of-care settings, while validating this
system using characterized human specimens in a CLIA-accredited lab environment. Completion of this project
will result in a novel point-of-care tool for both the established and emerging respiratory infections that threaten
public health, facilitating rapid treatment, follow-up, infection prevention, and epidemiologic containment.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><Academic Medical

Fixed-Target Platforms for Time-Resolved Crystallography,Fixed-Target Platforms for Time-Resolved Crystallography,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Next generation structural biology experiments look to move beyond static observations of structure to a
dynamic, time-resolved understanding of function. These next-level experiments are enabled by serial
crystallography at X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) and microfocus synchrotron beamlines but are limited by
issues of sample consumption. The long-term goal of this project is to democratize studies of protein structural
dynamics by developing robust fixed-target mounting strategies for light-, chemical-, and electrically-triggered
time-resolved protein crystallography experiments while maximizing sample utilization. This effort leverages the
expertise of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the BioCARS facility at the Advanced Photon Source
for testing and validation of new mounting strategies. These relationships will also enable rapid translation of
developed technologies to the larger structural biology community. We have four initial aims to do this:
Aim 1: Develop fixed-target strategies to facilitate the study of macromolecular crystallography targets
while maintaining biological activity. We will design and fabricate X-ray compatible sample holders that
maintain the stability of protein crystals over time while also allowing for easy sample loading, robotic handling,
and in situ spectroscopy. A particular focus will include enabling data collection in a fully anaerobic environment,
and the technologies developed here will serve as a basis for efforts in subsequent Aims.
Aim 2: Develop fixed-target platforms for photo-triggering of reactions for analysis via time-resolved
serial crystallography. We will develop X-ray compatible sample holders that take advantage of hydrodynamic
forces to create large-scale arrays of crystals for use in serial crystallography experiments. The polymer-based
fabrication strategy will enable fast, low-cost device fabrication, as well as allowing for direct imaging of samples,
in situ spectroscopy, and laser-based triggering of reactions for time-resolved X-ray crystallography studies.
Aim 3: Develop fixed-target platforms for chemical triggering of reactions for time-resolved serial
crystallography analysis. We will develop strategies to enable the controlled addition of a chemical species
(i.e., substrate, pH change) to enable the chemical triggering of reactions in crystals.
Aim 4: Utilize graphene-based devices to study structural dynamics based on high voltage triggering.
We will integrate graphene-based circuitry into our microfluidic devices to enable the use of a voltage-jump as
both a general strategy for triggering protein motions and to control electron transfer reactions.
The team is well qualified, merging expertise in microfluidics, X-ray science, and structural biology, with an
established history of developing new technology to address challenges within the structural biology community.
The impact will be improvements in the ability to perform time-resolved studies of protein structural dynamics
that will immediately enhance the research capabilities of a large base of NIH-supported and other researchers.",<3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA><3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A><Address><Affect><Attention><Biological><Biology><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Chemicals><Coenzyme M><Collaborations><Collection><Communities><Consumption><Coupled><Crystallographies><Crystallography><Data><Data Collection><Dehydration><Dehydrogenases><Democracy><Development><Devices><Electron Transport><Electronics><Environment><Future><Generations><Goals><HMG-CoA><Heat shock proteins><History><Human><Image><In Situ><Influenza HA><Influenza Hemagglutinin><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigators><Knowledge><Laboratories><Laser Electromagnetic><Laser Radiation><Lasers><Light><Location><Massachusetts><Measurement><Metals><Methods><Microfluidic Device><Microfluidic Lab-On-A-Chip><Microfluidic Microchips><Microfluidics><Mitochondria><Modern Man><Molecular><Motion><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Noise><O element><O2 element><Optics><Oxidoreductase><Oxidoreductase Gene><Oxygen><Performance><Phosphatases><Phosphohydrolases><Phosphomonoesterases><Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases><Photons><Photoradiation><Polymers><Protein Dynamics><Proteins><Qualifying><Reaction><Reaction Time><Recording of previous events><Reductases><Reporting><Research><Research Design><Research Personnel><Researchers><Response RT><Response Time><Robotics><Roentgen Rays><Sampling><Science><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Single Crystal Diffraction><Source><Spectroscopy><Spectrum Analyses><Spectrum Analysis><Stream><Structure><Structure-Activity Relationship><Study Type><Synchrotrons><System><Technology><Testing><Time><Translations><United States National Institutes of Health><Universities><Validation><Work><X Ray Crystallographies><X ray diffraction><X ray diffraction analysis><X-Radiation><X-Ray Crystallography><X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography><X-Ray Radiation><X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography><X-ray><Xray><Xray Crystallography><Xray diffraction><Xray free electron laser><base><bases><beamline><biologic><biological signal transduction><biomacromolecular><biomacromolecule><body water dehydration><chemical structure function><cost><design><designing><developmental><electric field><electron transfer><electronic><electronic device><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><fabrication><flu HA><flu hemagglutinin><graphene><histories><hydrodynamic flow><hydrodynamic forces><hydrodynamic laminar flow><hydrodynamic shear flow><hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA><imaging><improved><influenza viral HA><influenza viral hemagglutinin><influenza virus HA><influenza virus hemagglutinin><microfluidic chip><mitochondrial><new technology><next generation><novel><novel technologies><optical><polymer><polymeric><prevent><preventing><protein structure><protein structures><proteins structure><psychomotor reaction time><sensor><stress protein><structural biology><structure function relationship><study design><temperature jump><translation><validations><voltage><x-ray FEL><x-ray free-electron laser><µfluidic>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology
Defining a stromal niche for type 2-like lung regulatory T cells,Defining a stromal niche for type 2-like lung regulatory T cells,"Project Summary
Lung diseases such as acute lung injuries (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are leading
causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are traditionally thought of as critical
negative regulators of systemic immune responses; however, their local roles in tissues such as the lung are
being increasingly appreciated, where they can promote lung epithelial regeneration in both ALI and ARDS.
Subsets of tissue-resident Tregs (tTregs) are found to express transcription factors T-bet, Gata3, RORt, and
Bcl6, and have enhanced suppression towards their Th1, Th2, Th3/17, and Tfh immune ‘flavors,’ respectively.
Although tTreg function are beginning to be understood, how lung tTregs are regulated, positioned, and
maintained within their respective tissue niches remains unknown. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are
immune regulators and have been highlighted to play a role in tTreg biology. Production of IL-33 by a subset of
MSCs promotes the expansion and maintenance of visceral adipose tissue tTregs and human MSCs can induce
Tregs from conventional CD4+ T cells in vitro. Our group identified a stromal cell niche within the lung where
adventitial fibroblasts (AFs), an MSC subset, regulate type 2 effector lymphocytes (e.g. ILC2s and Th2 cells), in
part via the secretion of IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Using 3D thick section imaging, I have
shown that lung type 2-like tTregs (i.e. Gata3hi ST2+, KLRG1+) also localize to this niche, indicating AFs may
regulate lung tTregs and their subsets. When co-cultured with lung AFs, lymphoid Tregs significantly increased
proliferation, survival, and expression of type 2-like Treg markers ST2 and KLRG1 in a contact-dependent
manner. Additionally, AFs preferentially support ST2hi Tregs, as evidenced by higher proliferation, survivability,
and ST2 and KLRG1 expression. Using CellphoneDB V2.0, I identified extracellular matrix (ECM)–integrin
ligand–receptor pairings, such as ICAM, VCAM, and CD49d, that may mediate interactions between AFs and
Tregs. Upon blocking all three in a co-culture system, I found a significant decrease in Treg proliferation and ST2
and KLRG1 expression. I hypothesize that AFs regulate the maintenance and differentiation of lung Treg subsets,
preferentially supporting type 2-like lung Tregs, which play critical roles in post-injury lung repair. This proposal
will define the topography of type 2 lung tTregs and their role in naïve and inflammatory settings (Aim 1) and
determine the role of adventitial fibroblasts in the regulation of lung Treg subsets (Aim 2). This work utilizes
murine models of inflammation, as well as genetic ablations to dissect the local type 2 tTreg response in the lung.
High-dimensional flow cytometry, advanced imaging, and lung function measurements will be used to quantify
impacts on immune cells and functional lung recovery. Completion of these aims will elucidate the role of AFs in
the function and regulation of lung type 2 tTregs, providing novel mechanistic insight into the role MSCs play in
regulating immune subsets. Completion of this study provides a foundation for the development of precision
therapeutics to selectively regulate lung tissue Tregs subsets to impact the outcome of diverse lung diseases.",<3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><ARDS><Ablation><Acute Lung Injury><Acute Pulmonary Injury><Acute Respiratory Distress><Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome><Adipose tissue><Adult ARDS><Adult RDS><Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome><Adventitial Cell><Autoregulation><Biological Response Modifiers><Biomodulators><Body Tissues><CD106><CD106 Antigens><CD4 Cells><CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes><CD4 T cells><CD4 helper T cell><CD4 lymphocyte><CD4+ T-Lymphocyte><CD4-Positive Lymphocytes><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Count><Cell Function><Cell Number><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Signaling><Cell Survival><Cell Viability><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Cellular biology><Co-culture><Cocultivation><Coculture><Coculture Techniques><Da Nang Lung><Data Set><Development><Enhancer-Binding Protein GATA3><FOXP3><FOXP3 gene><Fatty Tissue><Fibroblasts><Flow Cytofluorometries><Flow Cytofluorometry><Flow Cytometry><Flow Microfluorimetry><Flow Microfluorometry><Forkhead Box P3><Foundations><GATA-3 factors><GATA-3 protein><GATA-Binding Protein 3><GATA3><GATA3 gene><GATA3 protein><GATA3 transcription factor><Genetic><Goals><Homeostasis><House Dust Mites><Housedust Mites><Human><ICAM><INCAM-110><Image><Immune><Immune Mediators><Immune Mediators/Modulators><Immune Regulators><Immune response><Immunes><Immunological response><Immunomodulation><In Vitro><Inducible Cell Adhesion Molecule 110><Inflammation><Inflammatory><Influenza A><Influenza A virus><Influenza Viruses Type A><Influenzavirus A><Injury><Integrins><Integrins Extracellular Matrix><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><JM2><Ligands><Location><Lung><Lung Diseases><Lung Parenchyma><Lung Respiratory System><Lung Tissue><Lung damage><Lymphatic cell><Lymphocyte><Lymphocytic><Lymphoid><Maintenance><Measurement><Mediating><Mice><Mice Mammals><Microscopy><Modeling><Modern Man><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Murine><Mus><Orthomyxovirus Type A><Outcome><Pathway interactions><Pericapillary Cell><Pericytes><Perivascular Cell><Physiological Homeostasis><Play><Position><Positioning Attribute><Precision therapeutics><Production><Proliferating><Pulmonary Diseases><Pulmonary Disorder><Pyroglyphidae><RNA Seq><RNA sequencing><RNAseq><Receptor Protein><Recovery><Regulation><Regulatory T-Lymphocyte><Reporter><Role><Rouget Cells><SCURFIN><Shock Lung><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Sorting><Stiff lung><Stromal Cells><Structure of parenchyma of lung><Subcellular Process><Surface><System><T cell response><T-Cell Proliferation><T-Cell Subsets><T-Lymphocyte Subsets><T-bet protein><T-bet transcription factor><T4 Cells><T4 Lymphocytes><TSLP><TSLP gene><Testing><Th-2 Cell><Th2 Cells><Therapeutic Uses><Thick><Thickness><Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin><Tissues><Treg><Type 2 Helper Cell><Type A Influenza><VCAM><VCAM-1><Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule><Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1><Visceral><Work><adipose><allergic airway disease><biological signal transduction><candidate identification><cell biology><design><designing><developmental><differential expression><differentially expressed><disease of the lung><disorder of the lung><epithelium regeneration><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><flow cytophotometry><high dimensionality><host response><imaging><immune modulation><immune regulation><immune system response><immunologic reactivity control><immunomodulatory><immunomodulatory biologics><immunoregulation><immunoregulatory><immunoresponse><injuries><insight><intercellular cell adhesion molecule><lung disorder><lung function><lung injury><lung repair><lung tissue repair><lymph cell><mesenchymal stromal cell><mortality><mouse model><murine model><novel><pathway><precision therapies><precision treatment><pulmonary><pulmonary damage><pulmonary function><pulmonary injury><pulmonary repair><pulmonary tissue damage><pulmonary tissue injury><receptor><regenerate epithelium><regulatory T-cells><reparative process><scRNA-seq><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single-cell RNA sequencing><social role><three dimensional><transcriptional differences><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing><wet lung><white adipose tissue><yellow adipose tissue>,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Lung; Rare Diseases
CD8+ tissue-resident immunity to primary and heterotypic Influenza A controlled by commensal microbiota,CD8+ tissue-resident immunity to primary and heterotypic Influenza A controlled by commensal microbiota,"Project Summary/Abstract
Neonates have the highest infection-related mortality of any age group with viral pneumonia
causing the majority of these estimated 1 million deaths per year. A majority of neonates in the
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) receive empiric antibiotic therapy. This antibiotic exposure
dysregulates the development of immunity, including influenza-specific CD8+ T cells, although
exactly how early-life antibiotic exposure affects the formation and function of tissue-resident
CD8+ T cells is unclear. With their canonical role as adaptive responders to viral infection, CD8+
T cells are key effector immune cells in both immediate and long-term host defense against
serious viral pneumonia. It is essential to better define how exactly early-life antibiotic exposure
disrupts tissue-resident CD8+ T cell formation and function in order to lessen the substantial
pneumonia-related mortality in neonates. Preliminary flow cytometry data in this proposal shows
that early-life antibiotic exposure reduces the formation of influenza-specific CD8+ T cells, which
leads to higher viral burden and morbidity. Preliminary single cell RNA (scRNA-) and single cell
Assay for Transposase-accessible Chromatin sequencing (scATACseq) data shows a similar
reduction in lung CD8+ T cells that is controlled by specific alterations in gene regulatory networks.
This data drives the overall hypothesis of this proposal that early-life antibiotic exposure
leads to a decrease in the formation and functions of tissue-resident CD8+ T cells following
both primary and heterotypic Influenza A infection. This proposal will test this hypothesis by
determining the effect of early-life antibiotic exposure on the formation and function of CD8+ T
cells in the lungs following challenge with Influenza A (Aim 1) and determining regulatory
mechanisms governing how this early-life antibiotic exposure affects the functions of CD8+ T cells
(Aim 2). Collectively, this work will provide novel, mechanistic insights into how early-life antibiotic
exposure is affecting the functions of influenza-specific tissue-resident CD8+ T cells. These Aims
expect to show an antibiotic-mediated reduction in CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity, cytokine production,
and proliferation, as well as changes in specific gene regulatory networks underlying the
functional dysregulation. The candidate driving this proposal is currently an MD/PhD student at
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital in the laboratory of Dr. Hitesh Deshmukh, who will use this proposal
to set a foundation for an independent career as a physician-scientist. The candidate will use this
proposal to support his future in the clinic as a pediatric intensivist, where findings from this
proposal will uncover new strategies leading to better outcomes for the most vulnerable neonates.","<21+ years old><Adoptive Transfer><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><Antibiotic Agents><Antibiotic Drugs><Antibiotic Therapy><Antibiotic Treatment><Antibiotics><Assay><Automobile Driving><Basal Transcription Factor><Basal transcription factor genes><Behavior Control><Behavioral Manipulation><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Body Tissues><CD8><CD8 Cell><CD8 T cells><CD8 lymphocyte><CD8+ T cell><CD8+ T-Lymphocyte><CD8-Positive Lymphocytes><CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes><CD8B><CD8B1><CD8B1 gene><CITE sequencing><CITE-seq><CITEseq><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cellular Assay><Cellular Function><Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Cessation of life><Childhood><Children's Hospital><Chromatin><Clinic><Complex><Data><Death><Development><Early identification><Epigenetic><Epigenetic Change><Epigenetic Mechanism><Epigenetic Process><Exposure to><Flow Cytofluorometries><Flow Cytofluorometry><Flow Cytometry><Flow Microfluorimetry><Flow Microfluorometry><Foundations><Frequencies><Future><Gene Expression><Gene Transcription><General Transcription Factor Gene><General Transcription Factors><Genetic Transcription><Grippe><H1N1><H1N1 Virus><H3N2><H3N2 Virus><Host Defense><Immune><Immunes><Immunity><Immunotherapeutic agent><Impairment><Infection><Influenza><Influenza A><Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype><Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype><Influenza A virus><Influenza Virus><Influenza Viruses Type A><Influenzavirus A><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Knowledge><LYT3><Laboratories><Life><Lower Respiratory Tract Infection><Lower respiratory infection><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Lytotoxicity><Measurement><Measures><Mediating><Memory><Mice><Mice Mammals><Miscellaneous Antibiotic><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Murine><Mus><Neonatal><Neonatal Intensive Care Units><Neonatal Mortality><Newborn Intensive Care Units><Non-Polyadenylated RNA><Orthomyxovirus Type A><Outcome><Pediatric Hospitals><Ph D student><Ph D. student><Ph.

A Tunable Nanophage Platform for Vaccine Development,A Tunable Nanophage Platform for Vaccine Development,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Newly emerging and long-standing infectious challenges, including arboviruses, Ebola virus and pandemic
coronaviruses (CoVs), among others, pose serious public health concerns. Additionally, the potential use of
biological agents as weapons of mass destruction poses an ongoing threat to humanity. All of these issues
have in common the need for development strategies that allow for the rapid design, screening and
formulation of potential vaccine candidates. We have developed a “designer nanoparticle” platform based on
λ phage-like particles, or nanophages (NPs), that can display multiple antigenic biomolecules alone and in
combination in rigorously defined ratios. The NPs can be rapidly modified to screen and evaluate potential
vaccine candidates against newly emerging threats. Herein we propose to develop tools and technologies for
rapid screening of multivalent vaccine candidates effective for current and emerging SARS-CoVs and pre-
emergent SARS-like CoVs. We will engineer “second generation” nanophages (NPs) that display the spike
receptor binding domain (RBD) for these pathogens, the primary target of neutralizing antibody (Ab)
responses. Physiochemical and structural characterization of the preparations will be employed to ensure
that they possess properties that are appropriate for a pharmaceutical preparation. We will also employ a
novel atomic layer deposition technology to generate thermostable, timed-release, single-shot vaccine
formulations that reduce or eliminate onerous “cold-chain” requirements for their distribution. We further
propose to determine the immunogenicity and protective capacity of mosaic NPs engineered to
simultaneously display multiple antigens. These studies will identify vaccine candidates that elicit potent,
durable, and broad neutralizing Ab and T cell responses and protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2
variants and pre-emergent SARS-like bat CoVs. In addition to developing this powerful platform and
implementing novel formulation strategies, these studies will help define mechanisms of immunogenicity and
develop a platform for the rapid engineering of vaccine candidates for existing and untoward emerging
biological threats. In sum, this application seeks to provide compelling evidence that the  nanophage system
provides a platform for facile and rapid generation, and formulation of highly active multi-antigen presenting
vaccines.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><2019-nCoV variant><2019-nCoV variant forms><2019-nCoV variant strains><Address><Antibodies><Antibody Response><Antigen

Subcellular mito-nuclear balance and gene expression dynamics in Alzheimers's disease,Subcellular mito-nuclear balance and gene expression dynamics in Alzheimers's disease,"Defects in mitochondrial function and subcellular trafficking along neuronal subcompartments are
hallmarks of genetic and idiopathic Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Neurons rely heavily on proper
mitochondrial function and localization, as mitochondria play a dual role: buffering calcium and also
providing the energy required for synaptic transmission and local translation. Mitochondria maintain
their own extrachromosomal genome and must coordinate gene expression programs with the nuclear
genome (mitonuclear coordination) to correctly assemble oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
complexes that make up the electron transport chain. This coordination is vital for proper cellular
function, as mitonuclear imbalance leads to orphan OXPHOS subunits that can overwhelm proteostasis
pathways. How mitonuclear balance is affected in AD and the collective effects of AD pathology in
subcellular transcriptome dynamics —from transcription to degradation and localization—, for both
nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded transcripts are unknown. We hypothesize that neuronal
architecture predisposes mitochondria located distal to the soma to mitonuclear imbalance, making
them prone to malfunction in neurodegenerative disease states. Recently, we developed a technique
(subcellular TimeLapse-seq: STLseq) that simultaneously quantifies the kinetic rates of transcription,
nuclear export, ribosome association, and degradation for each transcript, a process we refer to as
RNA-flow. This method combines RNA metabolic labeling and subcellular fractionation with Bayesian
modeling and has been adapted to capture mitochondrial-encoded genes, enabling quantitative
analysis of mitochondrial transcriptome dynamics and of mitonuclear co-regulation. Here, we will
analyze RNA-flow dynamics in AD by adapting STL-seq to neurons harboring AD-related mutations,
combined with the isolation of soma and neuronal projections. The overall goal of this proposal is to
determine the effects of AD in subcellular transcriptome dynamics and in mitonuclear coordination in
the soma and neuronal projections. In Specific Aim 1, we will use STL-seq to analyze the subcellular
transcriptome dynamics in AD and identify key regulatory factors. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine
the soma and neurites translatome, the mitonuclear coordination differences in soma and neuronal
projections, and how AD influences mitonuclear balance. The expected outcome from this grant will be
an understanding of AD pathology at the transcriptome, the translatome, and the mitonuclear
coordination levels in the soma and neuronal projections. These results will positively impact our
understanding of mitochondrial gene regulation in healthy neurons and in AD, exposing putative new
areas for therapeutic intervention.",<AD dementia><AD model><AD pathology><Address><Affect><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimer's disease model><Alzheimer's disease pathology><Alzheimer's pathology><Alzheimers Dementia><Anabolism><Architecture><Area><Bayesian Modeling><Bayesian adaptive designs><Bayesian adaptive models><Bayesian belief network><Bayesian belief updating model><Bayesian framework><Bayesian hierarchical model><Bayesian network model><Bayesian nonparametric models><Bayesian spatial data model><Bayesian spatial image models><Bayesian spatial models><Bayesian statistical models><Bayesian tracking algorithms><Binding><Buffers><Calcium><Cell Fractionation><Cell Function><Cell Nucleus><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Chars><Complex><Cytoplasm><Defect><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Diagnosis><Distal><Electron Transport><Engineering / Architecture><Equilibrium><Face><Gene Action Regulation><Gene Expression><Gene Expression Regulation><Gene Regulation><Gene Regulation Process><Gene Transcription><Genes><Genetic><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic Transcription><Genetic defect><Genome><Goals><Grant><Impairment><Induced pluripotent stem cell derived human neuron><Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Kinetics><Knowledge><Label><Length><Machine Learning><Maps><Membrane><Metabolic><Methods><Mission><Mitochondria><Mitochondrial Diseases><Mitochondrial Disorders><Modeling><Molecular Interaction><Mutation><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Cell><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural Transmission><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurites><Neurocyte><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neuron from iPSC><Neuron from induced pluripotent stem cells><Neurons><Non-Polyadenylated RNA><Nuclear><Nuclear Export><Nucleus><Orphan><Outcome><Oxidative Phosphorylation><Oxidative Phosphorylation Pathway><PSEN1><Pathway interactions><Physiologic><Physiological><Play><Porosity><Predisposition><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Process><Production><Public Health><RNA><RNA Expression><RNA Gene Products><RNA Transport><RNA-Binding Proteins><Research><Ribonucleic Acid><Ribonucleic Acid Transport><Ribosomes><Role><S182 protein><Salvelinus><Structure><Subcellular Process><Susceptibility><Synaptic Transmission><Techniques><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Intervention><Transcript><Transcription><Translations><Tweens><United States National Institutes of Health><alzheimer model><balance><balance function><biosynthesis><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><electron transfer><excitatory neuron><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><faces><facial><familial AD><familial Alzheimer><familial Alzheimer disease><genome mutation><global gene expression><global transcription profile><hiPSC-derived neurons><human disease><human iPSC-derived sensory neuron><iPS neurons><iPSC derived-neurons><iPSC-derived human neuron><induced pluripotent stem cell neurons><intervention therapy><interventional strategy><machine based learning><membrane structure><meter><millimeter><mitochondrial><neural cell body><neurodegenerative illness><neuronal><neuronal cell body><neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells><new drug target><new druggable target><new pharmacotherapy target><new therapeutic target><new therapy target><novel><novel drug target><novel druggable target><novel pharmacotherapy target><novel therapeutic target><novel therapy target><pathway><polysome profiling><presenilin 1 protein><presenilin-1><primary degenerative dementia><programs><protein homeostasis><proteostasis><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><social role><soma><subcellular fractionation><trafficking><transcriptome><translation><translatome>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Brain Disorders; Dementia; Genetics; Human Genome; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences
Probing the Toxic Effects of Early Stage Tau Pathology on Microglial Modulation of Neuronal Circuits Using iPSC Hippocampal Assembloids,Probing the Toxic Effects of Early Stage Tau Pathology on Microglial Modulation of Neuronal Circuits Using iPSC Hippocampal Assembloids,"Project Summary/Abstract
Recent genetic and functional studies suggest microglia play a significant role in tau-associated
neurodegeneration. However, key questions persist regarding microglia-neuron interactions in tau
pathology and how diseased neurons affect microglial function. Recent research indicates
neuronal electrophysiological defects, including alterations in oscillatory properties, can influence
microglial transitions in Alzheimer's models. Our findings support widespread microglial changes
early in tau pathology, including markers of synaptic regulation. We hypothesize that bidirectional
changes between microglia and neurons in early tauopathy facilitate disease progression. To
investigate, we propose a new model using microglial co-cultures with electrocompetent
hippocampal assembloids derived from patient iPSC lines with MAPT mutations and controls,
providing a foundation for exploring the maladaptive feedforward loop between microglia and
early neuronal dysfunction in tau-related pathology.","<2-photon><3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><AD dementia><AD model><Acceleration><Address><Affect><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimer's disease model><Alzheimers Dementia><Ammon Horn><Biosensor><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Calcium><Co-culture><Cocultivation><Coculture><Coculture Techniques><Complex><Cornu Ammonis><Cyclic Somatostatin><Data><Defect><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Development><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Dysfunction><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Encephalon><Exhibits><Foundations><Functional disorder><Ganglia><Genetic><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic Markers><Genetic defect><Growth Hormone Inhibiting Factors><Growth Hormone-Inhibiting Hormone><Hippocampus><Hortega cell><Image><Immunoblotting><Immunohistochemistry><Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue><Immunohistochemistry Staining Method><Implant><Induced DNA Alteration><Induced Mutation><Induced Sequence Alteration><Inflammatory><Inflammatory Response><Location><MFR gene><MFR protein><MT-bound tau><MYD-1><Macrophage Fusion Receptor><Microglia><Modeling><Mutation><Nerve Cells><Nerve Degeneration><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Cell><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural Ganglion><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurocyte><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neuron Degeneration><Neuronal Dysfunction><Neurons><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Organoids><P84><PTPNS1><PTPNS1 gene><Parvalbumins><Pathology><Pattern><Phagocytes><Phagocytic Cell><Phenotype><Physiology><Physiopathology><Play><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Property><Protein-Tyrosine Phosphatase, Nonreceptor Type, Substrate 1><Proteins><Regulation><Research><Role><SHP Substrate 1><SHPS1><SIRP-Alpha-1><SIRPA><SRIH><SRIH-14><Signal Pathway><Signal Regulatory Protein, Alpha Type, 1><Somatostatin><Somatostatin-14><Somatotropin Release Inhibiting Factors><Somatotropin Release-Inhibiting Hormone><Synapses><Synaptic><Tauopathies><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Tyrosine Phosphatase SHP Substrate 1><Western Blotting><Western Immunoblotting><abnormal tau><alzheimer model><amebocyte><biological sensor><cell type><comparative><cytokine><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><developmental><electrophysiological><excitatory neuron><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><gene biomarker><gene expression biomarker><gene marker><gene signature biomarker><genetic biomarker><genome mutation><gitter cell><growth hormone release inhibiting factor><hippocampal><hyper-phosphorylated tau><hyperphosphorylated tau><iPS><iPSC><iPSCs><imaging><induced pluripotent cell><induced pluripotent stem cell><induced pluripotent stem cells derived from patients><induced pluripotent stem cells from patients><inducible pluripotent stem cell><inhibitory neuron><insight><mesoglia><microglial cell><microgliocyte><microtubule associated protein tau mutation><microtubule bound tau><microtubule-associated protein tau mutation><microtubule-bound tau><mutant><mutant tau><mutation in microtubule associated protein tau><mutation in microtubule-associated protein tau><nerve cell death><nerve cell loss><neural><neural degeneration><neural dysfunction><neural network><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neurodegenerative illness><neurological degeneration><neuron cell death><neuron cell loss><neuron death><neuron loss><neuronal><neuronal cell death><neuronal cell loss><neuronal circuit><neuronal circuitry><neuronal death><neuronal degeneration><neuronal loss><neuropathologic tau><neuropathological tau><overexpress><overexpression><pathogenic tau><pathogenic tau gene mutation><pathological change in tau><pathophysiology><patient derived human iPS><patient derived human iPSC><patient derived human induced pluripotent stem cell><patient derived iPS><patient derived iPSC><patient derived induced pluripotent cells><patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells><patient-derived pluripotent stem cells><perivascular glial cell><primary degenerative dementia><protein blotting><response><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><social role><synapse><tau><tau Proteins><tau abnormality><tau associated neurodegeneration><tau associated neurodegenerative process><tau factor><tau induced neurodegeneration><tau intronic mutation><tau mediated neurodegeneration><tau mutation><tau neurodegenerative disease><tau neuropathology><tau pathological change><tauopathic neurodegenerative disorder><tauopathy><three dimensional><transcriptomics><two-photon><τ Proteins><τ mutation>",Acquired Cognitive Impairment;

Elucidating the mechanisms by which microgliopathy causes early-onset dementia,Elucidating the mechanisms by which microgliopathy causes early-onset dementia,"ABSTRACT
Dementias lead to disability and dependency and are the leading cause of death among all diseases. While
Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, genetically inherited dementias are epidemiologically
relevant and may provide insight into the pathogenic pathways and therapeutic targets for common dementias.
Here, we focus on an autosomal recessive microgliopathy, known as Nasu-Hakola Disease (NHD), which is
caused by rare homozygous loss-of-function mutations in either TREM2 or TYROBP (encoding DAP12). In
contrast to AD, which manifests with aging, NHD progresses quickly, often resulting in death by the fifth decade.
We recently examined specimens of brain occipital cortical tissues from three rare DAP12-deficient patients with
NHD by single nucleus RNA-seq. This analysis showed that lack of DAP12 is associated with a unique
transcriptome microglia profile indicative of enhanced RUNX1/2, STAT3 and TGFβ signaling pathways that
mediate tissue repair functions. We postulate that DAP12 attenuates the RUNX, STAT3 and/or TGFβ pathways.
In the absence of DAP12 (or TREM2), unrestricted signaling of these pathways may cause maladaptive
responses of microglia to stimuli normally received from the brain microenvironment, leading to exaggerated
tissue repair reactions, widespread tissue alterations, microvascular alterations, and neuronal loss. In this grant,
we aim to investigate whether the lack of DAP12 in microglia leads to heightened signaling of RUNX/STAT3 in
vitro. Furthermore, we will explore whether excessive RUNX/STAT3 signaling in microglia, independent of
DAP12 influence, disrupts the expression of genes responsible for microglial functions, including phagocytosis,
cytokine production, and wound repair. Ultimately, we seek to understand how these mechanisms contribute to
brain pathology. In Aim 1, we will investigate the impact of DAP12 deficiency on the expression of RUNX1/2 in
human iPSC-derived microglia (iMGL). Regardless of whether DAP12 directly regulates these factors, we will
explore the consequences of RUNX1/2 overexpression on transcriptome and functionality of iMGL. Additionally,
we will assess the repercussions of altered microglial expression of RUNX in vivo using a mouse model where
RUNX2 is selectively induced in microglia. In Aim 2, we will focus on STAT3, which drives macrophage
responses to IL-6 family cytokines and IL-10. Our preliminary data show that NHD microglia exhibit a
transcriptional signature resembling that of IL-10–STAT3-stimulated macrophages. We also found that DAP12-
deficient macrophages contain more phosphorylated and total STAT3 than do wild-type macrophages. We will
investigate whether lack of DAP12 increases STAT3 activation in human iMGLs and delineate the molecular and
functional changes induced by a gain-of-function mutant of STAT3 in human iMGLs. Furthermore, we will
evaluate the impact of STAT3 gain-of-function on glial phenotype and brain pathology using in an vivo knock-in
mouse model. Overall, this project will elucidate the role of RUNX1/2 and STAT3 in driving the expression of
genes which, if dysregulated, may alter microglial functions inducing brain pathology and dementia.",<12-20 years old><AD dementia><AML1><AMLCR1><Abscission><Adolescence><Aging><Alzheimer Type

Characterization of age-related changes in the testis stem cell niche,Characterization of age-related changes in the testis stem cell niche,"Project Summary
The objectives of this application are to characterize how age-related changes (1) in gene expression in niche
cells and (2) in the niche microenvironment impact the process of spermatogenesis. It is known that decreased
stem cell function with age is due at least in part to a decline in niche cell function and number. However, niche
cell aging is poorly understood in most tissues. This proposal uses the adult Drosophila testis as a model for
identifying age-related intrinsic and extrinsic processes in niche cell function. The work will capitalize upon the
powerful genetics available in flies, as well as the ability to unequivocally identify all cells in the testis. The fly
testis stem cell niche is formed by 12 quiescent niche cells (termed “hub” cells), which supports germline stem
cells and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs). The number of hub cells significantly declines during aging as they
lose quiescence and transdifferentiate into fully-functional CySCs. The PI's published work shows that Activin
signaling controls hub cell quiescence (and hence hub cell number) during aging. In young testes, Activin are
inhibited by the secreted antagonist Follistatin (Fs). In older testes, there are more Activin mRNAs and less Fs
mRNAs, leading to an increase in free local Activin proteins, which trigger the Activin receptor on hub cells.
Autonomous Activin signaling causes hub cells to exit quiescence and transdifferentiate into new CySCs,
resulting in the age-related decline of hub cells. These results support the model that age-related changes in
Activin-responsive genes induce the cell cycle in aged hub cells. State-of-the-art transcriptomic techniques will
be used in Aim 1 to identify genes differentially expressed in young and aged hub cells and genes whose
expression is dependent on Activin signaling. Validated genes will be used to test the model that the differentially-
upregulated genes causes hub cell proliferation, hub-to-CySC conversion, and, ultimately, hub cell loss.
 Other published work from the PI's lab shows an age-dependent change in the niche microenvironment: an
extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounds the niche in aged but not young testes. When this ECM is inhibited, there
is a significant increase in the number of hub cells in aged testes. These results support the model that the ECM
in aged testes binds Activin, increasing the chance of Activin binding to its receptor. However, there are no
reagents to monitor Activin or Fs proteins or pathway activity in vivo in flies. To overcome this barrier, new tools
to monitor Activin components and signaling in flies will be developed in Aim 2. They will be used to test whether
suppressing the ECM alters Activin and Fs distribution in aged testes and whether the ECM increases Activin
near the surface of hub cells, resulting in more pathway activation in aged testes. The studies in this proposal
will increase the knowledge base about how aging affects niche cell function and number in more complex
systems and will foster new avenues of research into mechanisms and treatments for age-related male infertility.",<21+ years old><Activin Receptor><Activin Receptor-Like Kinases><Activin-Binding Protein><Activins><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><Age><Aging><Antibodies><Antigenic Determinants><Basal Transcription Factor><Basal transcription factor genes><Binding><Binding Determinants><Bio-Informatics><Bioinformatics><Body Tissues><Bone-Derived Transforming Growth Factor><Candidate Disease Gene><Candidate Gene><Cannot achieve a pregnancy><Cell Aging><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Count><Cell Cycle><Cell Division Cycle><Cell Function><Cell Growth and Maintenance><Cell Growth in Number><Cell Maintenance><Cell Multiplication><Cell Nucleus><Cell Number><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Proliferation><Cell Senescence><Cell Signaling><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cells><Cellular Aging><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Cellular Proliferation><Cellular Senescence><Chronic><Cloning><Complex><Cues><Cyst><Difficulty conceiving><Drosophila><Drosophila genus><ECM><Enhancers><Epitopes><Extracellular Matrix><FSH-Releasing Protein><Flies><Follistatin><Fostering><Gene Expression><GeneHomolog><General Transcription Factor Gene><General Transcription Factors><Genes><Genetic><Goals><Homolog><Homologous Gene><Homologue><Human><Immunofluorescence><Immunofluorescence Immunologic><In Situ Hybridization><Infertility><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Intrinsic factor><Knowledge><Ligands><Male Infertility><Messenger RNA><Milk Growth Factor><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular Interaction><Monitor><Nucleus><Pathway interactions><Phosphorylation><Platelet Transforming Growth Factor><Population><Process><Progenitor Cells><Proliferating><Protein Phosphorylation><Proteins><Publishing><RNA Seq><RNA sequencing><RNAseq><Reagent><Receptor Protein><Receptor Signaling><Rejuvenation><Replicative Senescence><Reporter><Research><Role><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Somatic Cell><Spermatogenesis><Stem Cell like><Subcellular Process><Surface><System><TGF B><TGF-beta><TGF-β><TGFbeta><TGFβ><Techniques><Testicles><Testing><Testis><Tissues><Transcript><Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene><Transcription factor genes><Transforming Growth Factor beta><Transforming Growth Factor-Beta Family Gene><Work><adulthood><age associated><age associated alterations><age associated changes><age associated decline><age associated effects><age correlated><age correlated alterations><age correlated changes><age dependent><age dependent alterations><age dependent changes><age dependent decline><age effect><age linked><age related><age related alterations><age related changes><age related decline><age related effects><age specific><age specific alterations><age specific changes><aged><ages><aging effect><alterations with age><antagonism><antagonist><biological signal transduction><changes with age><decline with age><design><designing><differential expression><differentially expressed><expression vector><fertility cessation><fertility loss><fertility preservation><fly><fruit fly><germ stem cells><germline progenitor><germline progenitor cells><germline stem cells><global gene expression><global transcription profile><heparin proteoglycan><heparin sulfate proteoglycan><impact of age><in situ Hybridization Genetics><in situ Hybridization Staining Method><in vivo><infertile><influence of age><insight><knowledge base><mRNA><male><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new therapeutics><new therapy><next generation therapeutics><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><overexpress><overexpression><pathway><perlecan><preserve fertility><progenitor cell function><progenitor cell niche><progenitor cell population><progenitor function><progenitor niche><progenitor population><proteoheparin><receptor><self-renew><self-renewal><social role><stem and progenitor cell function><stem and progenitor cell niche><stem and progenitor cell population><stem and progenitor function><stem cell characteristics><stem cell function><stem cell niche><stem cell population><stem cells><stemness><tool><transcription factor><transcriptional differences><transcriptome><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing><transcriptomics><transdifferentiation>,Aging; Contraception/Reproduction; Genetics; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human; Urologic Diseases
C5ORF51 - a Novel Regulator of Cardiomyocyte Function and Homeostasis,C5ORF51 - a Novel Regulator of Cardiomyocyte Function and Homeostasis,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Adult human cardiomyocytes have poor capacity for proliferation and functional recovery after heart attack, thus
leading to the high morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, there is great need to under-
stand the underlying mechanisms of adult cardiomyocyte turnover and maturation. While screening for modula-
tors of TEAD1, a core component of the cardiac transcriptional network, my lab identified a novel factor—
C5ORF51/RIMOC1—as a potential cardiomyogenic modulator. C5ORF51 (hereinafter referred to as C5x) is a
previously uncharacterized protein of nearly unknown function, which appears to play critical roles in the regula-
tion of cardiomyocyte homeostasis and heart size. The overarching hypothesis is that C5x, as a novel TEAD1
cofactor, regulates cardiomyogenesis by functioning as a modulator of core cardiac transcription factors. The
rationale for the project is that both the ex vivo and in vivo C5x knockout models demonstrate significantly ac-
celerated cell cycle activity and cardiomyocyte endowment. Importantly, C5x-cardiomyocyte-knockout mice de-
velop massive cardiomegaly and premature mortality, demonstrating a critical role of C5x in maintaining normal
cardiac function. RNA sequencing analysis suggests C5x as a gatekeeper for the fetal gene program. We pro-
pose two aims to address our hypothesis: [Aim 1] Determine the mechanisms by which C5x modulates tran-
scription in cardiomyocytes. [Aim 2] Investigate the role of C5x in adult cardiomyocyte proliferation and matura-
tion. Under the first aim, we will investigate the molecular interactive model between C5x and TEAD1. We will
further determine the interacting partners of C5x in cardiomyocytes to understand its regulatory network. Under
the second aim, we will determine proliferation in the sub-aim 2A and function in sub-aim 2B. Specifically, we
will test whether C5x loss is sufficient to induce cell cycle reentry and fetal gene program reactivation in adult,
we will also test whether C5x loss is able to induce more cells to enter cell cycle in the cardiac injury models. We
will determine the necessity of C5x in cardiomyocyte maturation and function. The research proposed in this
application is innovative because this is the first study demonstrating the nonredundant role of C5x in vivo and
in heart and illustrating a novel transcriptional modulator in cardiomyocytes. The proposed study is significant
because it will uncover a novel regulatory mechanism leveraging cell cycling and maturation. Ultimately, this
knowledge has the potential of offering new opportunities for the development of innovative treatment modality
to induce cardiogenesis.",<21+ years old><Acceleration><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Autoregulation><Basal Transcription Factor><Basal transcription factor genes><Binding><Binding Sites><Bioenergetics><Biological><Biological Function><Biological Process><Biology><Birth><Calcium><Cardiac><Cardiac Muscle Cells><Cardiac Myocytes><Cardiac development><Cardiac infarction><Cardiocyte><Cardiomegaly><Cardiovascular Diseases><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Cycle><Cell Cycle Arrest><Cell Cycle Progression><Cell Division Cycle><Cell Line><Cell Maturation><Cell Nucleus><Cell Signaling><CellLine><Cells><Combining Site><Congestive Cardiomyopathy><Cytokinesis><Cytoplasmic Division><DNA><DNA Binding><DNA Binding Interaction><DNA Content><DNA Index><DNA Ploidy><DNA bound><Deoxyribonucleic Acid><Development><Dilated Cardiomyopathy><Diploid><Diploidy><Dysfunction><Endowment><Enhancers><Enlarged Heart><Entropy><Functional disorder><Gatekeeping><Gene Activation><Gene Expression><Gene Transcription><General Transcription Factor Gene><General Transcription Factors><Genes><Genetic Transcription><Goals><Heart><Heart Enlargement><Heart Injuries><Heart Muscle Cells><Heart failure><Heart myocyte><Homeostasis><Human><Impairment><In Vitro><Injury><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><KO mice><Knock-out><Knock-out Mice><Knockout><Knockout Mice><Knowledge><Life><M Phase><Mediating><Mice><Mice Mammals><Mission><Mitosis><Mitosis Stage><Modality><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><Molecular Interaction><Mononuclear><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Murine><Mus><Myocardial><Myocardial Infarct><Myocardial Infarction><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Nature><Neonatal><Nodal><Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions><Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences><Nucleus><Null Mouse><Parturition><Pathway interactions><Pattern><Physiological Homeostasis><Physiopathology><Play><Ploidies><Population><Premature Mortality><Proliferating><Proteins><Public Health><RNA Expression><RNA Seq><RNA sequencing><RNAseq><Reactive Site><Recovery of Function><Regenerative capacity><Regulation><Regulatory Regions><Research><Role><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Specific qualifier value><Specified><Strains Cell Lines><Testing><Transcription><Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene><Transcription factor genes><United States National Institutes of Health><adulthood><biologic><biological signal transduction><cardiac dimension><cardiac failure><cardiac function><cardiac infarct><cardiac injury><cardiac size><cardiogenesis><cardiomyocyte><cardiovascular disorder><chromosome complement><cofactor><coronary attack><coronary infarct><coronary infarction><cultured cell line><developmental><disease prevention><disorder prevention><fetal><function of the heart><functional recovery><gain of function><gatekeeper><genetic regulatory element><heart attack><heart development><heart dimension><heart dimension/size><heart formation><heart function><heart infarct><heart infarction><heart size><iPS><iPSC><iPSCs><in vivo><in vivo Model><induced pluripotent cell><induced pluripotent stem cell><inducible pluripotent stem cell><injuries><innovate><innovation><innovative><interest><loss of function><mortality><mouse model><murine model><neonatal mice><novel><pathophysiology><pathway><postmitotic><prevent><preventing><primitive cell><programs><regeneration ability><regeneration based therapy><regeneration capacity><regeneration therapy><regenerative therapeutics><regenerative therapy><repair><repaired><screening><screenings><social role><transcription factor><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing>,Cardiovascular; Genetics; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease
Fluorescence-based sequence-specific imaging of RNA modifications,Fluorescence-based sequence-specific imaging of RNA modifications,"Recent technological advances that allowed for the mapping of selected RNA modifications on a transcript-wide
scale have revealed a wide-spread distribution of N6-methyladenosine (m6A), pseudouridine (Ψ), 5-
methylcytosine (m5C), ribose 2’-O-methylation (Nm), and adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing on mRNA.
The m6A is the most abundant base modification in RNA (over 118,000 m6A peaks in human transcriptome),
and controls a plethora of systems, including stem cell proliferation and differentiation, cellular heat shock
responses, spermatogonia differentiation, maternal-to-zygotic transition, X-chromosome inactivation, UV DNA
damage response, neurogenesis, and tumorigenesis. A variety of illnesses have been further linked with m6A
methylation disorder, including acute myeloid leukemia, gliomas, breast cancer, and lung cancer in humans.
Despite widespread recognition of the important functions of RNA modifications, the availability of technologies
that can monitor and image site-specific RNA modifications are lacking. Novel tools for the site-specific
detection of RNA modifications in cells and other biological samples are urgently needed. The overall goal
of this project is to develop novel, easy to use fluorescence-based methods and reagents for sequence
specific imaging of RNA modifications. The goal of Phase I was to establish the feasibility of novel m6A
antibody-based imaging reagents. In Phase I, we have developed the first-in-class and the best-in-class
homogeneous antibody-based novel assays to determine the extent of site-specific m6A RNA modifications.
Furthermore, we greatly exceeded the original goal of Phase I by developing an additional novel “no antibody”
method which entirely avoids the use of m6A antibody, reducing reagent’s complexity and cost. With these two
novel methods established in Phase I, we are ready to move into a Phase II project. Our aims include Aim 1.
Develop optimal protocols for staining fixed cells using the methods established in Phase I. Aim 2. Test methods
to increase sensitivity of detection. Aim 3. Evaluate and compare the performance of all method variants using
cell culture systems. Aim 4. Expand and validate the methods to measuring other RNA modifications such as A-
to-I RNA editing and m5C. In addition, all the methods, reagents, and protocols developed and validated
internally by Mediomics will be sent to a leading laboratory in this field for third party validation to ensure that
Mediomics' newly developed assays work well in any laboratory that may have an interest in epitranscriptomics
and the quantification of RNA modifications. Successfully validated assay kits will be ready for commercialization.
These novel methods could become the first standard approach for analyzing RNA modifications in any sample
and will enable researchers to perform fluorescence-based imaging for RNA modifications in important biological
samples, including brain and cancer samples. It may further serve as an important diagnostic or prognostic
clinical tool for detecting altered modification levels in the mRNA of tumors.","<AML - Acute Myeloid Leukemia><Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia><Acute Myelocytic Leukemia><Acute Myelogenous Leukemia><Adenosine><Affinity><Antibodies><Assay><Base Sequence><Binding><Bioassay><Biological><Biological Assay><Biology><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Breast Cancer><Cancers><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Culture System><Cell Differentiation><Cell Differentiation process><Cell Signaling><Cell model><Cells><Cellular model><Clinical><D-Ribose><Data Bases><Databases><Deposit><Deposition><Detection><Diagnostic><Disease><Disorder><Encephalon><Exhibits><Fluorescence><Glial Cell Tumors><Glial Neoplasm><Glial Tumor><Glioma><Goals><Heat Shock><Heat-Shock Reaction><Heat-Shock Response><Human><Image><Inosine><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigators><Laboratories><Link><Low Molecular Weight Nuclear RNA><Lyonization><Malignant Breast Neoplasm><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Malignant Tumor of the Lung><Malignant neoplasm of lung><Maps><Measures><Medicine><Messenger RNA><Methodology><Methods><Methylation><Micro RNA><MicroRNAs><Modeling><Modern Man><Modification><Molecular Interaction><Monitor><Neuroglial Neoplasm><Neuroglial Tumor><Non-Polyadenylated RNA><Nucleotide Sequence><Oncogenesis><Pathway interactions><Performance><Permeability><Phase><Phylogenetic Analysis><Phylogenetics><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Pseudouridine><Pulmonary Cancer><Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm><RNA><RNA Decay><RNA Editing><RNA Gene Products><RNA Sequences><RNA Splicing><RNA methylation><RNA, Messenger, Editing><Reagent><Research Personnel><Researchers><Ribonucleic Acid><Ribose><Ribosomal RNA><Sampling><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Site><Small Molecular Weight RNA><Small Nuclear RNA><Spermatogonia><Spermatophores><Splicing><Staining method><Stains><System><Techniques><Technology><Testing><Tissue Sample><Transcript><Transfer RNA><Translations><Triplet Codon-Amino Acid Adaptor><UV damaged DNA><UV induced DNA damage><UV irradiated DNA><Validation><Variant><Variation><Work><X Inactivation><X-Chromosome Inactivation><acute granulocytic leukemia><acute myeloid leukemia><base><bases><biologic><biological signal transduction><cell fixing><cell imaging><cellular differentiation><cellular imaging><clinical prognostic><commercialization><commercialization readiness><cost><data base><design><designing><detection sensitivity><epitranscriptomics><fluorescence imaging><fluorescent imaging><fluorophore><glial-derived tumor><global gene expression><global transcription profile><imaging><interest><large data sets><large datasets><lung cancer><mRNA><malignancy><malignant breast tumor><miRNA><miRNAs><neoplasm/cancer><neurogenesis><neuroglia neoplasm><neuroglia tumor><new approaches><novel><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><nucleic acid sequence><pathway><performance tests><progenitor cell proliferation><progenitor proliferation><rRNA><response><snRNA><spermatogone><spermatospore><spermigonium><spermospore><stem and progenitor cell proliferation><stem cell proliferation><stoichiometry><tRNA><tool><transcriptome><transfer Ribonucleic acids><translation><tumor><tumorigenesis><uRNA><ultraviolet damaged DNA><ultraviolet induced DNA damage><ultraviolet irradiated DNA><validations>",Biotechnology; Cancer; Genetics
Genomic encoding of heterogeneity,Genomic encoding of heterogeneity,"Project Summary/Abstract
In development, the embryo generates many cell types with distinct gene expression programs, leading to
heterogeneity across cells. In cancer, mutation generates heterogeneity, with a growing recognition that non-
genetic (epigenetic) mechanisms contribute to tumor heterogeneity and treatment failure. The ability to take the
same genetic template and form different cell states, exhibiting cell-to-cell variation in gene expression and
behavior, is fundamental to many cell systems across problems in human health including stem cells, cancer,
and immune cell function. Yet, the mechanisms by which cell systems encode heterogeneity in gene expression
are unclear. Pluripotent embryonic stem cells give rise to all the cells of the adult mammal, and primary
embryonic stem cells are genetically stable in culture, making them an ideal system for studying the emergence
of non-genetic heterogeneity in cell systems. Cell-to-cell variation in gene expression that arises in the absence
of environmental signals has previously been termed `noise', or attributed to stochastic processes of gene
expression. However, gene expression heterogeneity is reproducible, suggesting regulation. The goal of this
proposal is to identify regulatory mechanisms by which the genome encodes non-genetic heterogeneity in cell
systems. We will use embryonic stem cells as a model system for gene expression heterogeneity. First, we will
identify transcription factor pairs whose combined activity at enhancers leads to transcriptional heterogeneity of
the regulated gene. In order for heterogeneity to result in forming distinct states with the potential to prime stem
cells into different lineages, heterogeneity must be heritable. Second, using a modified Luria-Delbruck fluctuation
analysis, we will identify memory loci capable of heritable transmission of non-genetic heterogeneity across cell
generations. Motifs such as autoregulation, whereby a gene's product can regulate its own production, may
contribute to the formation of different cell states and therefore to heterogeneity across a cell population. Third,
we will manipulate a single factor within or outside of an autoregulatory loop to determine how it impacts
heterogeneity. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage an assay we have developed which allows the
identification of actively transcribed regulatory regions and genes in small subsets of cells. Completion of these
goals will address longstanding questions about the origins of heterogeneity in cell systems and will advance a
systems level approach for understanding cell state. If successful, the proposal may unlock future studies
applying similar approaches to identify non-genetic drivers of tumor heterogeneity and treatment failure.
Therapeutic targeting of these mechanisms may unlock new treatment strategies for cancer.",<21+ years old><Adult><Adult Human><Assay><Autoregulation><Basal Transcription Factor><Basal transcription factor genes><Behavior><Bioassay><Biologic Models><Biological Assay><Biological Models><Cancers><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Development><ES cell><Embryo><Embryonic><Enhancers><Epigenetic><Epigenetic Change><Epigenetic Mechanism><Epigenetic Process><Exhibits><Future><Gene Expression><Gene Expression Process><Gene Transcription><General Transcription Factor Gene><General Transcription Factors><Generations><Genes><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic Template><Genetic Transcription><Genetic defect><Genome><Genomics><Goals><Health><Heritability><Heterogeneity><Homeostasis><Human><Immune><Immunes><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Intratumoral heterogeneity><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Mammalia><Mammals><Memory><Model System><Modern Man><Mutation><Noise><Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions><Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences><Physiological Homeostasis><Population><Production><Progenitor Cells><RNA Expression><Regenerative Medicine><Regulation><Regulator Genes><Regulatory Regions><Reproducibility><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Stochastic Processes><Subcellular Process><System><Systems Biology><Transcription><Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene><Transcription factor genes><Transcriptional Regulatory Elements><Transmission><Treatment Failure><Variant><Variation><adulthood><biological signal transduction><cell type><developmental><embryonic progenitor><embryonic stem cell><epigenetically><gene product><genetic regulatory element><genome mutation><heterogeneity in tumors><intra-tumoral heterogeneity><intratumor heterogeneity><malignancy><neoplasm/cancer><new therapeutic approach><new therapeutic intervention><new therapeutic strategies><new therapy approaches><new treatment approach><new treatment strategy><non-genetic><nongenetic><novel therapeutic approach><novel therapeutic intervention><novel therapeutic strategies><novel therapy approach><progenitor cell function><progenitor function><programs><regulatory gene><stem and progenitor cell function><stem and progenitor function><stem cell function><stem cell of embryonic origin><stem cells><stochastic method><therapeutic target><therapy failure><trans acting element><transcription factor><transmission process><tumor heterogeneity>,Genetics; Human Genome; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Embryonic - Non-Human
Deciphering the underlying mechanisms of craniofacial spliceosomopathies,Deciphering the underlying mechanisms of craniofacial spliceosomopathies,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Nager syndrome (OMIM#154400) is a rare craniofacial and limb disorder characterized by midface retrusion,
micrognathia, absent thumbs, and radial hypoplasia. This disorder results from mutations in the SF3B4
(splicing factor 3b, subunit 4) gene, which encodes SAP49, a protein that is a component of the spliceosome.
The spliceosome is a complex of RNA and proteins that function together to remove introns and join exons
from transcribed pre-mRNA. While the spliceosome is present and functions in all cells of the body, many
spliceosomopathies – including Nager syndrome – are often cell/tissue-specific in their pathology. In Nager
syndrome patients it is the neural crest (NC)-derived craniofacial skeletal structures that are affected. The
mechanisms underlying Nager syndrome pathology, as well as its tissue-specificity, are poorly understood.
Interestingly, other craniofacial spliceosomopathies, such as craniofacial microsomia (SF3B2), mandibulofacial
dysostosis Guion-Almeida type (EFTUD2), Burn-McKeown syndrome (TXNL4A), and Verheij syndrome
(PUF60) share similar clinical features with Nager syndrome, however it is unclear if they are caused by the
same underlying mechanisms. In this application, I will combine use of a Xenopus tropicalis sf3b4 mutant line
and Nager syndrome patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to tease apart the mechanisms
underlying Nager syndrome. This combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches will provide novel insights into
the mechanisms driving craniofacial defects in the context of Nager syndrome, which can then be translated to
other craniofacial spliceosomopathies to determine if they share a common root cause. The proposed
experiments will test the hypothesis that SF3B4 has NC-specific targets and/or binding partners, and upon
mutation these interactions are disrupted or lost, leading to abnormal NC development and subsequent Nager
syndrome-associated craniofacial defects. I have crafted three specific aims to test this possibility. Specific Aim
1: Using preliminary data from RNA-seq analyses performed on a Xenopus tropicalis sf3b4 mutant line, I
propose to identify the biological pathways disrupted in Nager syndrome by testing candidate genes via gain-
and loss-of-function experiments in Xenopus tropicalis. Specific Aim 2: In collaboration with the Columbia Stem
Cell Core, I propose to generate and characterize a Nager syndrome patient-derived iPSC line, and use this
line to characterize NC in the context of Nager syndrome. Specific Aim 3: In the R00 phase of the application, I
plan to use the knowledge and experience from modeling Nager syndrome and develop in vivo and in vitro
models of other craniofacial spliceosomopathies in order to determine their root cause. Altogether these
studies will provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying Nager syndrome craniofacial defects, which
can be used to inform work on other craniofacial spliceosomopathies, establishing a unique view on
understanding craniofacial development and disorders.","<Affect><Animals><Apoptosis><Apoptosis Pathway><Apoptotic><Automobile Driving><Berry syndrome><Berry-Treacher Collins syndrome><Binding><Biological><Biological Function><Biological Process><Body Tissues><Bone structure><CRISPR approach><CRISPR based approach><CRISPR method><CRISPR methodology><CRISPR technique><CRISPR technology><CRISPR tools><CRISPR-CAS-9><CRISPR-based method><CRISPR-based technique><CRISPR-based technology><CRISPR-based tool><CRISPR/CAS approach><CRISPR/Cas method><CRISPR/Cas technology><CRISPR/Cas9><CRISPR/Cas9 technology><Candidate Disease Gene><Candidate Gene><Cas nuclease technology><Categories><Cell Body><Cell Death><Cell Line><Cell Locomotion><Cell Migration><Cell Migration Pathway><Cell Movement><CellLine><Cells><Cellular Migration><Cellular Motility><Cephalic><Chondrocytes><Classification><Cleft Palate><Clinical><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats approach><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats method><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats methodology><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technique><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology><Collaborations><Complex><Cranial><Craniofacial Abnormalities><Data><Defect><Development><Disease><Disorder><Embryo><Embryonic><Event><Extremities><Facial Bones><Franceschetti syndrome><Franceschetti-Zwahlen syndrome><Franceschetti-Zwahlen-Klein syndrome><Gene Expression><Gene Transcription><Genes><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic Transcription><Genetic defect><Head><In Situ Hybridization><In Vitro><Intervening Sequences><Introns><Joining Exons><Knowledge><Limb structure><Limbs><Maintenance><Mandibulofacial Dysostosis><Mediating><Messenger RNA><Micrognathism><Modeling><Molecular><Molecular Interaction><Mutation><Nager acrofacial dysostosis><Nager anomaly><Nager syndrome><Nager-de Reynier syndrome><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neural Crest><Neural Crest Cell><Neurocyte><Neuronal Differentiation><Neurons><Non-Polyadenylated RNA><Non-Trunk><OMIM><Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man><Ontology><Pathogenicity><Pathology><Pathway interactions><Patients><Phase><Phenotype><Pre-mRNA><Production><Progenitor Cells><Programmed Cell Death><Proteins><Quantitative RTPCR><Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR><RNA><RNA Expression><RNA Gene Products><RNA Seq><RNA Splicing><RNA sequencing><RNA, Messenger, Precursors><RNAseq><Radial><Radius><Ribonucleic Acid><Role><Role of PI3K subunit p85 in regulation of Actin Organization and Cell Migration><Short interfering RNA><Skeleton><Small Interfering RNA><Specificity><Spliceosomes><Splicing><Strains Cell Lines><Syndrome><Systematics><Testing><Thomson complex><Thumb><Thumb structure><Tissues><Transcription><Translating><Treacher Collins Syndrome><Treacher Collins-Franceschetti syndrome><Variant><Variation><Work><Xenopus><Xenopus sp.><Zwahlen syndrome><bilateral facial agenesis><biologic><candidate validation><cell motility><cell type><clawed frog><craniofacial><craniofacial anomalies><craniofacial complex><craniofacial defects><craniofacial development><craniofacial disorder><craniofacial malformation><craniofacial microsomia><craniofacies><cultured cell line><developmental><developmental disease><developmental disorder><disease model><disorder model><driving><dysostosis mandibulofacialis><experience><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><face bone structure><gain of function><genome mutation><hESC><human ES cell><human ESC><human embryonic stem cell><iPS><iPSC><iPSCs><immunocytochemistry><in situ Hybridization Genetics><in situ Hybridization Staining Method><in vitro Model><in vivo><induced pluripotent cell><induced pluripotent stem cell><induced pluripotent stem cells derived from patients><induced pluripotent stem cells from patients><inducible pluripotent stem cell><insight><knock-down><knockdown><loss of function><mRNA><mRNA Precursor><malformation><mandibulofacial dysostosis with limb malformations syndrome><mandibulofacial syndrome><melanocyte><micrognathia><mutant><necrocytosis><neuronal><novel><ossa faciei><pathway><patient derived human iPS><patient derived human iPSC><patient derived human induced pluripotent stem cell><patient derived iPS><patient derived iPSC><patient derived induced pluripotent cells><patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells><patient-derived pluripotent stem cells><preaxial acrofacial dysostosis><preaxial mandibulofacial dysostosis><premature><prematurity><protein function><qRTPCR><rare condition><rare syndrome><siRNA><skeletal structure><skeletons><social role><stem cells><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing><transcriptomics>","Congenital Structural Anomalies;

Developing programmable RNA writing tools with the novel RNA-guided RNA-targeting CRISPR effector Cas7-11,Developing programmable RNA writing tools with the novel RNA-guided RNA-targeting CRISPR effector Cas7-11,"Project Summary: While gene editing technologies have revolutionized the ability to programmably edit DNA
with high efficiency in diverse tissues, there remain several challenges with DNA editing, including permanent
off-targets, concern for permanent correction of certain diseases, and some diseases being better targeted by
other modalities than gene editing. For example, treatment of triplet repeat disorders with gene editing remains
difficult, due to the difficulty of targeting repeat regions in the genome and the need to make large and precise
deletions, without causing off-target genome rearrangements and other undesired effects on the genome. RNA
modifications, however, may offer a better approach with notable features: 1) temporal and reversible
modification of genetic diseases, 2) minimal off-targets which are reversible and less harmful, and 3) more
versatile editing beyond genome editing. For example, with triplet repeat disorders, an RNA writing strategy
could allow for collapse of the repeats to the exact desired number, an approach that would be more
successful than gene editing or RNA knockdown strategies that have failed. To accomplish RNA writing, which
involves all possible base edits (transitions and transversions), small or large insertions, and small or large
replacements (e.g. exon swapping), some approaches have been developed, such as trans-splicing, but with
limited success. Trans-splicing relies on the recruitment of an RNA template to a pre-mRNA without any active
targeting domains and involves competition with the cis target. As a result, programmable trans-splicing has
had low efficiency. We hypothesized that combining trans-splicing with programmable RNA guided CRISPR
systems could help boost the efficiency of the trans-splicing mechanism, enabling any potential type of RNA
edit, insertion, deletion, or replacement to be incorporated into endogenous transcripts. While we and others
have characterized novel programmable RNA targeting CRISPR systems, such as Cas13, and developed tools
from these systems, use of these tools have been limited in cellular systems due to a non-promiscuous
cleavage activity known as collateral activity. While Cas13 has been shown to have specific RNA cleavage
activity in some cell types, other cell types have had significant collateral cleavage of cellular RNAs, leading to
toxicity in cell models. The proposed work will address these needs by combining biochemical characterization,
structural characterization, and enzyme engineering to develop new RNA targeting CRISPR nucleases
without collateral activity, such as the novel CRISPR-Cas7-11 enzyme, for specific RNA writing tools in
conjunction with trans-splicing to enable any possible RNA edit. Beyond optimizing the RNA writing technology
via trans-splicing optimization using RNA and protein engineering, we will showcase RNA writing’s therapeutic
potential by correcting triplet repeat disorders in iPSC-derived human neurons. The developed technologies in
this proposal will accelerate the pace of biomedical research and enable treatment of many genetic disorders,
many of which are not treatable with gene editing, bringing more therapies to patients.","<Abscission><Acceleration><Binding><Bio-Informatics><Biochemical><Bioinformatics><Biology><Biomedical Research><Body Tissues><CRISPR><CRISPR/Cas system><Cell Body><Cell model><Cells><Cellular model><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats><Complex><DNA><DNA Molecular Biology><DNA Viruses><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Deoxyribonucleic Acid><Development><Disease><Disorder><Dose><Engineering><Enzyme Gene><Enzymes><Excision><Exons><Extirpation><Family><Genes><Genetic Diseases><Genome><Guide RNA><Individual><Induced pluripotent stem cell derived human neuron><Investigators><Location><Methods><Modality><Modification><Molecular Biology><Molecular Interaction><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neurological><Non-Polyadenylated RNA><Nucleic Acids><Ortholog><Orthologous Gene><Patients><Performance><Point Mutation><Pre-mRNA><Process><Protein Engineering><Proteins><RNA><RNA Editing><RNA Gene Products><RNA Sequences><RNA Splicing><RNA based therapeutics><RNA based therapy><RNA therapy><RNA, Messenger, Editing><RNA, Messenger, Precursors><Reaction><Removal><Research Personnel><Research Resources><Researchers><Resources><Ribonucleic Acid><Safety><Specificity><Splicing><Surgical Removal><System><Technology><Therapeutic><Tissues><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Trans RNA Splicing><Trans-Splicing><Transcript><Translations><Trinucleotide Repeats><Triplet Repeats><Work><Writing><base><base editing><bases><causal allele><causal gene><causal mutation><causal variant><causative mutation><causative variant><cell type><codon reiteration><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><developmental><disease model><disorder model><gRNA><gene editing platform><gene editing system><gene editing technology><gene editing tools><gene-editing toolkit><genetic condition><genetic disorder><genetic protein engineering><genome editing><genomic editing><hiPSC-derived neurons><human iPSC-derived sensory neuron><iPSC-derived human neuron><improved><insight><knock-down><knockdown><mRNA Precursor><neurodegenerative illness><neuropsychiatric disease><neuropsychiatric disorder><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new therapeutics><new therapy><next generation therapeutics><novel><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><nuclease><protein design><recruit><resection><structural biology><success><tech development><technology development><therapeutic RNA><therapeutically effective><tool><translation>",Biotechnology; Genetics
Nanotechnology for Glial Targeting and Inhibition of Neuroinflammation for Alzheimer’s Disease,Nanotechnology for Glial Targeting and Inhibition of Neuroinflammation for Alzheimer’s Disease,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of death among the elderly community in the United States.
The socio-economic burden of the disease is steeply escalating as the number of AD patients is projected to nearly
triple to 14 million by 2060. Memory loss is a core clinical phenotype results from irreversible damage of
neuronal circuits in the brain. Although advances in science have made remarkable strides in understanding the
disease, the currently approved drugs focus primarily on alleviating symptoms, not stalling disease progression.
Neuroinflammation due to the aggregation and inappropriate clearance of fibril amyloid-beta (fAβ) by glial cells
is a hallmark of AD. Glial cells including microglia and astrocytes communicate through signaling pathways
and an ensemble of receptors including scavenger receptors (SRs). In AD, the recognition of fAβ by SRs triggers
glial activation, attenuates glial clearance of fAβ and exacerbates neuroinflammation.
Our labs have advanced a library of synthetic amphiphilic macromolecule (AMs)-based nanoparticles (NPs) that
can be targeted to ensemble SR receptors. Our preliminary data show that SR-specific AM-NPs counteract the
fAβ-mediated inflammatory microglial activation. In line with this, the internalization of fAβ through SRs is
blocked by AM-NPs in microglia. Furthermore, AM-NPs arrest the in vitro formation of fAβ from monomers.
Interestingly, our AM-NPs stimulate fAβ lysosomal clearance in microglial. Finally, our AM-NPs prevent the
neurotoxic effect of fAβ-induced microglial inflammatory cytokines.
Given these findings, we hypothesize that the utilization of SR-selective NPs is a neuroprotective multimodal
approach to interrupt fAβ-SRs complex formation and arrest inflammatory cascade of glial communication. This
hypothesis will be addressed in the following specific aims: (1) to elucidate the role of SR-targeted NPs in the
amelioration of fAβ-mediated pathological glial communications; and (2) to evaluate the longer-term
neuroprotective effects of SR-specific AM-NPs within an AD pathological model based on 3D multicellular
human organoid cultures.
In summary, this exploratory study seeks to develop an innovative nanotechnology to abrogate the
neuroinflammatory crosstalk that exacerbates AD progression using state-of-the-art technologies of
nanoparticles, stem cells, and brain-like mimetic human organoids.",<3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><AD dementia><AD pathology><Abeta clearance><Acceleration><Active Oxygen><Address><Alzheimer Type

Indoles from commensal microbiota promote mobility during aging,Indoles from commensal microbiota promote mobility during aging,"Abstract: Aging is associated with loss of mobility and infirmity, which accounts for 23% of the total global burden of
disease in people aged 60 years and older and will only increase over the next 20 years. Frailty is associated with dysbiosis
23, 41-43, but it is unclear what microbiota products contribute to health or frailty. We identified indole and its derivatives as
molecules secreted by benevolent commensal bacteria that act across diverse phyla (C. elegans, Drosophila and mice) to
augment healthspan and allow animals to live better for longer1. Indoles derived from commensal bacteria act via the Aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) to promote healthy intestinal homeostasis20, augment intestinal barrier integrity and limit
systemic inflammation1, 20, 23, as well as promote DNA repair and genome integrity in stem cells and germ cells22.
Preliminary and published data1 also suggest that as animals age, indoles limit the loss of muscle proteins concomitant
with loss of mobility. Citing our work as the starting point1, a recent metabolomic study was initiated using samples from
the Arivale and Osteoporotic Fractures in Men [MrOS] cohorts and found that loss of indole producing bacteria and
reduced plasma indole levels correlated with decreased mobility in aged humans44, 45. We hypothesize that indoles act via
Ahr to (i) promote stability of muscle proteins essential for the contractile apparatus by promoting chaperone-mediated
refolding of damaged proteins, and by regulating proteasome activity to promote loss of irreparable proteins and limit
aggregation of damaged proteins. We have identified other indole-regulated process in muscle that may act in
conjunction with proteostatic mechanisms to promote mobility in the aged. These include regulation of genes associated
with mitochondrial respiratory function and efficiency, which fuels muscle activity but declines with age46, 47. Together, we
hypothesize that these mechanisms maintain muscle mass and function and thereby promote mobility in the aged. Aim 1
will determine the mechanism by which indole limits age-dependent loss of existing assembled myofibrils via upregulating
the levels of the myosin chaperone UNC-45 and additional chaperones and proteasome components. Aim 2 will develop
address whether indole affects additional cellular pathways by using genetic approaches to identify which indole-
regulated genes are critical for maintaining mobility during aging. Gene ontogeny (GO) analysis to date has shown that
indole upregulates genes essential for mitochondrial function in aging animals. Thus, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that
indole maintains or improves mitochondrial function in aged animals so as to fuel muscle activity and/or limit production
of factors that disrupt proteostasis (e.g. ROS). We use genetic and biochemical analysis in the nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans, whose striated muscles exhibit significant structural conservation with mammals. Importantly, as C. elegans age,
they exhibit loss of mobility and changes in proteostasis, including loss of the contractile apparatus and mitochondrial
function, characteristic features of sarcopenia in mammals. Here, we also propose to corroborate our worm results in

Optimization of a potent and cell active CK2 chemical probe for Alzheimer's disease therapy,Optimization of a potent and cell active CK2 chemical probe for Alzheimer's disease therapy,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of progressive dementia in adults over the age of 65, is a
devastating disorder without effective treatment options. Available drugs treat late-stage symptoms rather than
addressing disease-causing pathways. There is an urgent need for new protein targets that potentially act via
previously unexplored mechanisms to halt AD progression. Human protein kinases represent a highly tractable
class of targets that have largely been examined with respect to oncology, but which hold great promise in areas
such as neurodegeneration. Protein kinase casein kinase 2 (CK2) is highly expressed in the mammalian brain
and has many validated substrates that are critical in neural cell homeostasis and signaling processes across
synapses. These roles have indicated that CK2 is a key regulator of neuronal function and that it may represent
a novel target to treat neurodegenerative diseases like AD. Through extensive evaluation of our first library of
pyrazolopyrimidines, we identified SGC-CK2-1 as a potent, selective, and cell-active CK2 chemical probe.
Remarkably, despite years of research pointing to CK2 as a key driver in cancer, SGC-CK2-1 did not elicit a
significant antiproliferative phenotype when tested in nearly 180 cancer cell lines. SGC-CK2-1 also does not
demonstrate toxicity in human stem cell-derived neurons/microglia at doses required for CK2 inhibition. Guided
by crystal structures and published data, we have developed a medicinal chemistry plan to address the metabolic
liabilities of SGC-CK2-1 and develop it into a probe that is suitable for in vivo use. Part of this strategy involves
also adding functionalities into our CK2 inhibitors that improve their blood–brain penetrance. Calculations and
predictive software models will aid medicinal chemistry efforts and help prioritize compounds to be made. Many
of these simulations will be corroborated with experimental data, including kinetic solubility, lipophilicity,
microsomal stability, and CNS pharmacokinetic data, which will increase our confidence in their utility. Optimized
CK2 inhibitors will be profiled in stem cell-based assays that model key pathogenic signaling pathways in AD
related to neuroinflammation, a process we have shown to be at least partially regulated by CK2. Our lead CK2
chemical probe candidates will be dosed in a 3xTg mouse model of AD to validate CK2 target engagement in
vivo. All publications that have attempted to characterize CK2 function using a CK2 inhibitor have used a sub-
optimal compound, most often CX-4945 or TBB, that suffers from potent inhibition of off-target kinases and other
liabilities, including broad antiproliferative activity, that preclude its use in AD. Despite these issues, CX-4945
has been dosed systemically in humans for oncology indications, which confirms that clinical inhibition of CK2 is
tolerated. Development of a potent and selective in vivo probe targeting CK2 that lacks broad antiproliferative
activity will enable confirmation of its putative role in AD for the first time.",<21+ years old><3xTg><3xTg-AD mice><3xTg-AD mouse><65 and older><65 or older><65 years of age and older><65 years of

Stem Cell-Derived Microfluidic Placenta Organoids,Stem Cell-Derived Microfluidic Placenta Organoids,"Project Summary
The placenta performs important functions to ensure proper development of the fetus, including oxygen and
nutrients exchange, waste product removal and hormone secretion. It also acts as a barrier to protect the fetus
from harmful substances and pathogens that might be present in the maternal circulation. Despite its short
lifespan, the placenta plays a critical role in the survival and growth of the fetus. Implantation failure and
inadequate placental development can lead to pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia, miscarriage,
and fetal growth restriction. However, our understanding of human placenta development is quite limited due to
scarcity of fetal tissues, ethical restrictions and lack of practical experimental tools.
 Our preliminary studies show that human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) possess an intrinsic self-
organization property. When a colony of hTSCs starts to cluster, they spontaneously form an organoid with
cavities resembling trophoblastic lacunae, and can continuously develop into a multicellular tissue resembling
first-trimester placental villi under a neuregulin 1 (NRG1) stimulation. In this proposed research, we will
undertake an exploratory, high-risk but high-reward study to generate a microfluidic human placenta model.
Specifically, we will derive hTSCs from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) through a naïve
pluripotency stage. We will then use these hTSCs to generate microfluidic placenta organoids. The role of YAP
signaling in regulating spontaneous syncytiotrophoblast (STB) differentiation will be examined. We will further
induce the development of placental villus-like tissue by modulating timing and concentration of NRG1, and
examine morphologies and cell composition of the resultant placenta organoids. Important, we will conduct
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on the resultant placental villus-like tissue at different times
and perform transcriptome-wide comparisons with published in vivo human placenta scRNA-seq datasets.
 This hTSC- derived human placenta organoid system will offer the first-of-its-kind experimental platform
for studying previously elusive stages of human placental development. This research, if successful, will lead
to innovative technologies and methodologies for controllable, reproducible, and scalable manufacturing of in
vitro stem cell-derived tissues with molecular and cellular characteristics consistent with the early/mid-gestation
placenta. This platform can also serve as a screening tool to investigate the potential negative effects of
pathogens, drugs or toxic substances on human placental development, which will accelerate research efforts
towards early diagnosis, prevention and treatment of pregnancy complications associated with insufficient or
abnormal placentation.",<1st trimester><Abnormal placentation><Abscission><Acceleration><Acetylcholine Receptor Inducing Activity><Address><Adhesions><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Blastocyst Implantation><Blastosphere><Body Tissues><Breast Cancer Cell Differentiation Factor P45><Carcinoma><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Differentiation><Cell Differentiation process><Cell Line><Cell Lineage><Cell Locomotion><Cell Migration><Cell Movement><Cell Signaling><CellLine><Cells><Cells Placenta-Tissue><Cellular Migration><Cellular Motility><Characteristics><Chorionic villi><Circulation><Complex><Data Set><Development><Diagnosis><Dissociation><Drugs><Dysfunction><EPH Gestosis><Early Diagnosis><Early Placental Phase><Embryo Development><Embryo Implantation><Embryogenesis><Embryonic Development><Endometrial><Endometrium><Ensure><Epithelial cancer><Epithelium><Ethics><Excision><Extirpation><Fetal Growth Restriction><Fetal Growth Retardation><Fetal Tissues><Fetus><First Pregnancy Trimester><First Trimester><Functional disorder><Generalized Growth><Gestation><Goals><Growth><Hormone secretion><Human><IUGR><Image><In Vitro><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Intrauterine Growth Retardation><Invaded><Investigation><Knowledge><Knowledge acquisition><Location><Macaca><Macaque><Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms><Malignant Epithelial Tumors><Medication><Methodology><Microfluidic Device><Microfluidic Lab-On-A-Chip><Microfluidic Microchips><Microfluidics><Miscarriage><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><Morphogenesis><Morphology><NDF Protein><NRG1 Gene Product><NRG1 Protein><Neuregulin 1><Nidation><Normal Placentoma><Nutrient><O element><O2 element><Organoids><Ovum Implantation><Oxygen><Pathologic><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phase><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiopathology><Placenta><Placenta Embryonic Tissue><Placental Development><Placental Villi><Placentation><Placentome><Play><Pluripotent Stem Cells><Poison><Pre-Eclampsia><Preeclampsia><Pregnancy><Pregnancy Complications><Pregnancy Toxemias><Preimplantation Embryo><Prevention><Process><Progenitor Cells><Property><Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis><Publishing><Removal><Reproducibility><Reproduction><Research><Resolution><Role><Sampling><Screening procedure><Sensory And Motor Neuron-Derived Factor><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Source><Spontaneous abortion><Strains Cell Lines><Surgical Removal><Syncytiotrophoblast><System><Time><Tissue Growth><Tissues><Toxic Chemical><Toxic Substance><Uterine lining><Uterus><Villous><Waste Products><bacteria pathogen><bacterial pathogen><biological signal transduction><blastocyst><blastula><cell motility><cellular differentiation><complications during pregnancy><cultured cell line><design><designing><developmental><drug/agent><early detection><embryo attachment><endometrial stroma><epithelial carcinoma><ethical><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><failure Implantation><fetus tissue><global gene expression><global transcription profile><hiPSC><high reward><high risk><hormonal secretion><human iPS><human iPSC><human induced pluripotent cell><human induced pluripotent stem cells><human inducible stem cells><iPS><iPSC><iPSCs><imaging><impaired fetal growth><in vivo><induced human pluripotent stem cells><induced pluripotent cell><induced pluripotent stem cell><inducible pluripotent stem cell><innovative technologies><intra-uterine growth restriction><intra-uterine growth retardation><intrauterine growth restriction><life span><lifespan><manufacture><microfluidic chip><model of animal><morphogenetic process><natural Blastocyst Implantation><non-human primate><nonhuman primate><ontogeny><pathogen><pathogenic bacteria><pathophysiology><pluripotency><pluripotent progenitor><pluripotent state><pre-eclamptic><pre-implantation embryo><pregnancy toxemia/hypertension><pregnancy-related complications><prenatal growth disorder><prevent><preventing><public health relevance><resection><resolutions><scRNA-seq><screening><screening tools><screenings><self organization><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single-cell RNA sequencing><social role><stem cell derived tissues><stem cells><tool><toxic compound><transcriptome><transcriptomics><trophoblast><trophoblast progenitor><trophoblast progenitor cell><trophoblast stem cell><wasting><womb><µfluidic>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Contraception/Reproduction; Infertility; Maternal Health; Pediatric; Pregnancy; Prevention; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - Human; Women's Health Research
Diversity Supplement: Optically Promoting Cardiac Maturation Using Engineered Peptides,Diversity Supplement: Optically Promoting Cardiac Maturation Using Engineered Peptides,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The promise of human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hSC-CMs) opens doors towards the feasibility
of personalized medicine against cardiac diseases and for performing more accurate drug discovery studies.
Moreover, hSC-CMs overcome the issue of species differences when using animal models for high throughput
screening studies. However, one of the bottlenecks for scaling up the use of hSC-CMs is their ability to accurately
reflect the native structure and function of adult human cardiomyocytes. Current efforts to address this critical
challenge involve maturation protocols that use biophysical cues such as electrical stimulation or substrate-
induced tissue alignment. Methods for electrical stimulation often utilize electrode contacts for field stimulation,
bulky instrumentation for combining electrical stimuli delivery with mechanical or sustained chemical stimulation,
or genetically modifying cells to be light-responsive. Although we have seen successes through these induction
and stimulation approaches, the field would benefit from a stimulation approach with minimal culture contact to
reduce risk of infection during long-term cultures, as well as a light-based approach with higher spatiotemporal
resolution than electrode-based stimulation. Here, we propose a new paradigm for stimulating hSC-CMs towards
maturation by interfacing these cells with peptide-based substrates that can induce tissue anisotropy and
are engineered to convert light to stimulatory cues. Our team will develop peptides functionalized with
chromophore units and cell-binding epitopes as materials that can be used for light-based stimulation of hSC-
CMs, in combination with induction of tissue alignment, towards maturation. The long-term goal of this project is
to establish light stimulation via engineered peptides as a viable method to stimulate cardiomyocytes and
promote hSC-CM maturation in an electrodeless and non-genetic manner. We hypothesize that transient
charging and other associated light-induced processes at the cardiomyocyte-biomaterial interface can influence
extracellular potential, resulting in the photostimulation of hSC-CMs towards maturation. Our rationale for
proposing a materials-based approach for stimulating hSC-CMs stems from previous reports of conjugated
polymers being used as a photoactive substrate for triggering action potentials of other excitable cells. To test
our hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: (1) establishing design parameters for engineered
peptide substrates with optimal photostimulation efficiency; (2) test the cellular- and tissue-level impact of
peptide-mediated photostimulation in combination with anisotropic cues; and (3) elucidate the effect of the
proposed photostimulation method, along with anisotropy cues, on hSC-CM maturation. By establishing the
design rules for the proposed photoexcitable peptides for eliciting combinatorial cues to stimulate hSC-CMs and
ensure their capability to excite cardiac cells, this innovative approach offers a new strategy for a “wireless”
stimulation of cardiac tissues towards maturation, and can therefore significantly contribute towards addressing
the grand challenge of immaturity of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.",<21+ years old><Action Potentials><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Anisotropy><Antigenic Determinants><Architecture><Automobile Driving><Behavior><Binding><Binding Determinants><Biophysics><Body Tissues><Calcium><Cardiac><Cardiac Diseases><Cardiac Disorders><Cardiac Muscle Cells><Cardiac Myocytes><Cardiocyte><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Diseases><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Culture Techniques><Cell Signaling><Cell Survival><Cell Viability><Cells><Charge><Chemical Stimulation><Common Rat Strains><Cues><Drug Screening><Dysfunction><E-stim><Electric Stimulation><Electrodes><Engineering><Engineering / Architecture><Ensure><Epitopes><Film><Frequencies><Functional disorder><Gene Expression><Generations><Goals><Heart Diseases><Heart Injuries><Heart Muscle Cells><Heart Vascular><Heart myocyte><Heating><High Throughput Assay><In Vitro><Intermediary Metabolism><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigation><Light><Measurement><Measures><Mechanics><Mediating><Metabolic Processes><Metabolism><Methods><Microelectrodes><Miniaturized Electrodes><Modeling><Molecular Interaction><Monitor><Muscle Cells><Myocytes><Nanostructures><Neonatal><Optics><Pattern><Peptide Library><Peptides><Phenotype><Photoradiation><Physiopathology><Polymers><Process><Progenitor Cells><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Rat><Rats Mammals><Rattus><Reaction><Reporting><Research><Resolution><Risk Assessment><Risk Reduction><Side><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Source><Stimulus><Stress><Structure><Surface><Technology><Testing><Therapeutic><Tissues><Toxicology><Transducers><Transfection><Ventricular><adulthood><biological signal transduction><biomaterial interface><biophysical foundation><biophysical principles><biophysical sciences><cardiac injury><cardiac tissue engineering><cardiomyocyte><cardiovascular disorder><cell culture><cell cultures><chromophore><circulatory system><combinatorial><conditioning><design><designing><disease mechanisms study><driving><drug discovery><electrostimulation><engineered heart tissue><extracellular><genetically engineered cells><genetically modified cells><heart disorder><hiPSC><high throughput screening><human iPS><human iPSC><human induced pluripotent cell><human induced pluripotent stem cells><human inducible stem cells><human progenitor cell derived><human stem cell-derived><improved><indexing><induced human pluripotent stem cells><infection risk><innovate><innovation><innovative><instrumentation><irradiation><mechanic><mechanical><minimally invasive><model of animal><monomer><nano-sized structures><nano-structures><new approaches><non-genetic><nongenetic><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><optical><optogenetics><pathophysiology><personalization of treatment><personalized medicine><personalized therapy><personalized treatment><polymer><polymeric><reduce risk><reduce risks><reduce that risk><reduce the risk><reduce these risks><reduces risk><reduces the risk><reducing risk><reducing the risk><regeneration based therapy><regeneration therapy><regenerative therapeutics><regenerative therapy><resolutions><response><risk-reducing><scale up><spatiotemporal><species difference><stem><stem cell based approach><stem cells><success><temporal measurement><temporal resolution><time measurement><wireless>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Human
Studying alcohol-associated liver disease and its interaction with rs738409 variant in PNPLA3 in a liver culture model,Studying alcohol-associated liver disease and its interaction with rs738409 variant in PNPLA3 in a liver culture model,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), caused by excessive alcohol consumption, is a growing public health
problem with a significant impact on the global population. In the United States, ALD is now a cause of rising
liver-related mortality, especially among younger patients.
 Despite this severity, there are currently no FDA-approved therapies. The absence of consensus on
optimal drug targets or strategies underscores gaps in our mechanistic understanding of disease drivers.
While animal models have greatly contributed to our understanding of ALD pathogenesis, their utility and
clinical relevance remain a subject of debate. To enhance diagnostic capabilities and advance effective
therapeutics, it is imperative to establish reliable human-relevant models that mimic the liver's response to
disease-specific challenges. The increasing number of genetic variants associated with ALD susceptibility
further underscores the necessity for human-relevant systems.
 To address these limitations, we devised a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived model
for ALD research, capitalizing on a multicellular in vitro liver culture system recently pioneered in our lab.
Within this multicellular setup, we co-cultivated hiPSC-derived hepatocytes, macrophages, and hepatic
stellate cells (HSCs), mirroring the intricate dynamics of liver physiology in both health and disease. Our
investigations unveiled that subjecting the liver culture to clinically relevant blood-alcohol concentrations
successfully replicated many pivotal alcohol (EtOH)-induced and endotoxin (i.e., LPS)-mediated ALD features.
Deeper scrutiny of hepatocytes over time revealed a macrophage-mediated upregulation of hepatic progenitor
markers, a dedifferentiation phenotype frequently observed in ALD patients. Furthermore, the liver cultures
exhibited a heightened reaction to EtOH/LPS than EtOH or LPS alone, especially in terms of HSC activation.
Subsequent investigation unveiled that EtOH exposure sensitized HSCs to LPS stimulation and TGFβ-
induced activation, revealing a previously unexplored mechanism underlying ALD pathogenesis.
 Across three aims, employing cell and molecular approaches, we capitalize on the unique features of
this platform to address questions that cannot be sufficiently explored through existing ex vivo human-relevant
systems. We focus on our working hypothesis, postulating that activated macrophages induce hepatocyte
dedifferentiation through the secretion of soluble factors (Aim 1), and that EtOH exposure elicits changes in
specific genes and pathways, contributing to the heightened sensitivity of HSCs to LPS and TGFβ (Aim 2).
Aim 3 seeks to unravel the roles of a genetic risk factor (i.e., rs738409 C>G variant in PNPLA3), in ALD
development. These efforts will pave the way for more precise therapeutic interventions and targeted
treatments. A better comprehension of the genetic influencers of ALD risk has the potential to enhance the
identification of at-risk populations and fortify disease prevention strategies.",<3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><Absolute ethanol><Address><Alcohol Chemical Class><Alcohol Drinking><Alcohol

A framework for interpreting global effects of genetic variants contributing to disease risk,A framework for interpreting global effects of genetic variants contributing to disease risk,"Advances in next-generation sequencing are enhancing the routine detection of human genetic variants,
particularly in clinical settings. Yet, the ability to interpret the functional consequences of these variants has
lagged far behind. While the identification of clinically actionable and pathogenic mutations has revolutionized
the field of precision medicine, these unfortunately represent a small minority of reported human genetic variants.
A large fraction of patients (~30-70%) who undergo diagnostic genome sequencing are found to have variants
of unknown significance (VUS), for which a clinical impact cannot be assigned. Multiple computational methods
have been designed to score the severity of a particular protein-coding mutation. While informative, predictions
from these methods are imperfect and do not give mechanistic insights into a variant’s impact. On the other
hand, laboratory-based functional genomics approaches have been used to characterize individual pathogenic
variants in human cell lines or model organisms, but these methods are low-throughput and can only focus on a
handful of mutations. Given the sheer volume of identified (and as-yet undiscovered) genetic variants in need of
clinical interpretation, there is a pressing need for high-throughput technologies to address this challenge. Here,
we describe complementary experimental and computational strategies for high-throughput
characterization of the impact of genetic variants in key regulatory and DNA repair genes. We focus on
mutations in ""trans-acting factors” such as chromatin regulators, transcription factors and DNA repair genes,
which are widely implicated in human disease. Mutations in these genes have the potential to induce widespread
transcriptomic, chromatin or genomic changes, and thus are most amenable to the strategies described in our
proposal. Notably, while these categories represent only a subset of clinically actionable genes, they nonetheless
encompass thousands of potential gene targets. We interrogate two classes of phenotypes: global
transcriptomic/chromatin changes induced by mutations to key transcription factors or other regulatory proteins,
and mutator phenotypes induced by disrupting proteins involved in DNA repair processes. We first develop
scBE-seq (single cell base editor sequencing), which combines pooled, high-precision genome editing with
single-cell sequencing assays to interrogate effects of hundreds of variants simultaneously. scBE-seq leverages
chemical base editing (BE) to introduce specific single nucleotide variants (SNVs). In parallel, we develop
computational approaches leveraging genomics datasets from large biobanks to identify genes harboring high-
impact variants which can be followed up using scBE-seq. Overall, our proposal brings together complementary
expertise spanning computational human genomics, molecular biology, genome editing and
development/implementation of genomic technologies. We envision the proposed experimental and
computational strategies will make important advances in the ability to interpret the impact of individual variants
in a variety of contexts and provide insights for predicting the effects of previously unobserved genetic variants.","<Active Follow-up><Address><Affect><Angioma Pigmentosum

Domain adaptation approaches to unify established and emerging sequencing technologies,Domain adaptation approaches to unify established and emerging sequencing technologies,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Advances in sequencing technologies provide new opportunities to interrogate biological systems from multiple
perspectives. However, the introduction of new technologies highlights a problem many researchers face:
missing data. Missing observations across technologies and biological states is a frequently observed problem
in the field of computational biology. This missingness can be a result of limitations in the technology, the rarity
of a biological state, or because the technology has not been widely adopted. While one technology may have
high sparsity in biological observations, there is an opportunity to leverage existing, complementary data from
an established technology to impute the missing biological observations.
We address these issues by utilizing new methodological advances in machine learning, primarily focusing on
domain adaptation techniques. These techniques learn patterns in one dataset that can be adapted to another
dataset, enabling cross-technology information sharing. Our proposal introduces a general framework in which
domain adaptation techniques can be used to unite an emerging technology with a different, but technology. To
highlight the broad utility of this approach, we apply this model to three biomedical applications: 1) Predict
cell-type-specific perturbation response in rheumatoid arthritis; 2) Predict tissue-of-origin from cell-free DNA
(cfDNA); 3) Predict progenitor-specific gene signatures from cell-free DNA in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
The proposed aims not only unite existing and emerging sequencing technologies, but enable the discovery of
new biology that is difficult or infeasible to directly observe.
The research proposed builds on my experience in using statistical approaches for transcriptomic data. During
the K99 phase I will require further training from my mentoring team in deep generative modeling (Dr. Casey
Greene), modeling of single-cell data (Dr. Fan Zhang), and modeling of cfDNA and chromatin accessibility (Dr.
Srinivas Ramachandran). The research will be conducted at the University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical
Campus, in the Center for Health AI. In this institution, I will have access to the Colorado Clinical and
Translational Sciences Institute and the RNA Bioscience Initiative, which provide resources for building an
interdisciplinary and translational research program. With this training and available institutional resources, I
will have a solid foundation on which to build an independent research program focused on domain adaptation
applications for high-throughput sequencing technologies.",<AML - Acute Myeloid Leukemia><Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia><Acute Myelocytic Leukemia><Acute Myelogenous Leukemia><Address><Adopted><After Care><After-Treatment><Aftercare><Area><Atlases><Atrophic Arthritis><Autoimmune Diseases><Beneficence><Benevolence><Biodiversity><Biologic Sciences><Biological><Biological Diversity><Biological Markers><Biological Sciences><Biology><Biopsy><Bioscience><Body Tissues><Bone Marrow><Bone Marrow Blood-Deriving Cell><Bone Marrow Blood-Forming Cell><Bone Marrow Cells><Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System><Bone marrow biopsy><Bypass><Cancer Detection><Cancers><Causality><Cell Body><Cell model><Cells><Cellular Assay><Cellular model><Chromatin><Clinical Sciences><Colorado><Computational Biology><Computational Technique><DMARD><DMARDs><DNA><Data><Data Reporting><Data Set><Deoxyribonucleic Acid><Dimensions><Disease><Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs><Disease-Modifying Second-Line Drugs><Disorder><Dissociation><Emergent Technologies><Emerging Technologies><Epigenetic><Epigenetic Change><Epigenetic Mechanism><Epigenetic Process><Etiology><Evaluation><Expression Signature><Face><Foundations><Frequencies><Gene Expression Profile><Goals><Graft Rejection><Health><High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing><High-Throughput Sequencing><Incidence><Information Technology><Institution><Interdisciplinary Research><Interdisciplinary Study><Investigators><Learning><Life Sciences><Machine Learning><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Masks><Measurement><Medical><Mentors><Methodology><Methods><Modality><Modeling><Molecular><Monitor><Multidisciplinary Collaboration><Multidisciplinary Research><Non-Polyadenylated RNA><Outcome><Patients><Pattern><Phase><Procedures><Process><Progenitor Cells><Proteomics><RNA><RNA Gene Products><RNA Seq><RNA sequencing><RNAseq><Research><Research Personnel><Research Resources><Researchers><Resolution><Resources><Rheumatoid Arthritis><Ribonucleic Acid><Sampling><Scientist><Severities><Severity of illness><Single cell seq><Solid><Source><T-Cells><T-Lymphocyte><Techniques><Technology><Tissues><Training><Translational Research><Translational Research Enterprise><Translational Science><Transplant Rejection><Transplantation Rejection><Transposase><Universities><Work><acute granulocytic leukemia><acute myeloid leukemia><autoimmune condition><autoimmune disorder><autoimmunity disease><bio-markers><biologic><biologic marker><biological systems><biomarker><career><causation><cell assay><cell free DNA><cell free circulating DNA><cell type><cohort><computer biology><data diversity><data representation><data representations><disease causation><disease severity><diverse data><emerging sequencing technology><epigenetically><experience><faces><facial><flexibility><flexible><gene expression pattern><gene expression signature><gene signatures><generative models><genetic signature><insight><interest><learning activity><learning method><learning strategies><learning strategy><machine based learning><malignancy><minimally invasive><model building><multiomics><multiple omics><neoplasm/cancer><new sequencing technology><new technology><novel sequencing technology><novel technologies><panomics><post treatment><progenitor><programs><resolutions><response><response to therapy><response to treatment><rheumatic arthritis><single cell next generation sequencing><single cell sequencing><stem cells><therapeutic response><therapy response><thymus derived lymphocyte><tool><transcriptional profile><transcriptional signature><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing><transcriptomics><translation research><translation research enterprise><translational investigation><translational research program><treatment effect><treatment response><treatment responsiveness>,Arthritis; Autoimmune Disease; Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Human Genome; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Rare Diseases; Rheumatoid Arthritis
Systematic characterization of tandem repeat variants contributing to complex traits,Systematic characterization of tandem repeat variants contributing to complex traits,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic loci linked to complex
traits, but determining the causal variants, target genes, and biological mechanisms responsible for each signal
remains challenging. While traditionally GWAS has focused on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the
advent of biobank-scale next-generation sequencing datasets as well as advanced functional genomics
techniques now enable systematic interrogation of the role of more complex variants in polygenic traits.
 We focus on the role of genetic variation at repetitive regions of the genome. Specifically, we consider
two repeat types: short tandem repeats (STRs), consisting of repeated motifs of 1-6bp, and variable number
tandem repeats (VNTRs), with motifs of 7+bp, which we collectively refer to as tandem repeats (TRs). TRs exhibit
rapid mutation rates that render them one of the largest sources of genetic variation in humans. Increasing
evidence suggests that TRs act as an important source of causal variants for complex traits and may drive some
of the strongest GWAS signals identified to date. Yet, due to bioinformatic and experimental challenges in
studying repeats, the genome-wide role of TRs on complex human traits is only beginning to be uncovered.
 We hypothesize that TR variants are key drivers of complex traits. We recently published the first
genome-wide integration of TRs into the GWAS framework. This identified 93 STRs predicted to causally impact
blood and serum biomarker traits and estimated STRs explain 5-10% of GWAS signals for these traits. We have
experimentally interrogated the effects of thousands of promoter TRs by optimizing a massively parallel reporter
assays (MPRA) to enable studying low-complexity sequences. Using our MPRA we were able to show
widespread and cell-type specific TR effects on expression.
 While these findings offer intriguing evidence that thousands of TRs contribute to human phenotypes,
they have been limited by the range of TRs that could be accurately imputed into available GWAS datasets and
the biological mechanisms by which TRs affect complex traits remains unknown in most cases. Here, we
leverage (i) newly available whole genome sequencing (WGS) for hundreds of thousands of individuals from UK
Biobank (UKB) and All of Us (AoU) which will enable direct TR genotyping rather than imputation, (ii) a suite of
computational tools we have developed for population-scale TR analysis and association testing, and (iii) our
recently developed MPRA and genome editing frameworks for experimental interrogation of TR effects to
systematically evaluate the contribution of TRs to complex traits in humans. Using these, we will develop scalable
methods to perform TR-based GWAS in large biobanks to generate a comprehensive catalog of TRs associated
with complex traits (Aim 1), use MPRA to investigate the effects of tens of thousands of TRs on gene regulation
(Aim 2) and perform deep characterization of candidate medically relevant TRs in induced pluripotent stem cells
and their differentiated derivatives in cell lines originating from ancestrally diverse donors (Aim 3).",<3' Untranslated Regions><3'UTR><Affect><Assay><Bio-Informatics><Bioassay><Bioinformatics><Biological><Biological Assay><Biological Markers><Blood><Blood Platelet Count><Blood Platelet Number><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Blood Serum><Catalogs><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Differentiation><Cell Differentiation process><Cell Line><Cell Signaling><CellLine><Complex><Computational toolkit><DNA Methylation><DNA Molecular Biology><Data><Data Set><Enhancers><Environment><Exhibits><GWA study><GWAS><Gene Action Regulation><Gene Expression><Gene Expression Regulation><Gene Regulation><Gene Regulation Process><Gene variant><Genes><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic Diversity><Genetic Polymorphism><Genetic Variation><Genetic defect><Genome><Genomics><Genotype><Goals><Gonosomes><Human><Human Genetics><Individual><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><LDL Cholesterol><LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins><Length><Link><Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol><Maps><Medical><Methods><Minisatellite Repeats><Minisatellites><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular Biology><Mutation><NGS Method><NGS system><Phenotype><Platelet Count><Platelet Count measurement><Platelet Number><Play><Polygenic Characters><Polygenic Inheritances><Polygenic Traits><Population><Publishing><QTL><Quantitative Trait Loci><RNA Seq><RNA Splicing><RNA sequencing><RNAseq><Repetitive Element><Repetitive Regions><Repetitive Sequence><Reporter><Research Resources><Resources><Role><Sampling><Serum><Sex Chromosomes><Short Tandem Repeat><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Simple Repetitive Sequence><Simple Sequence Repeat><Single Base Polymorphism><Single Nucleotide Polymorphism><Source><Splicing><Strains Cell Lines><Tandem Repeat Sequences><Tandem Repeats><Techniques><Testing><VNTR><VNTR Loci><VNTR Region><VNTR Sequences><Variable Number of Tandem Repeats><Variable Tandem Repeats><Variant><Variation><Work><allele variant><allelic variant><beta-Lipoprotein Cholesterol><bio-markers><biobank><biologic><biologic marker><biological signal transduction><biomarker><biorepository><candidate identification><case control><case-controlled><catalog><causal allele><causal gene><causal mutation><causal variant><causative mutation><causative variant><cell type><cellular differentiation><computational suite><computational toolbox><computational tools><computational toolset><computerized tools><cultured cell line><design><designing><entire genome><full genome><functional genomics><gene locus><genetic locus><genetic variant><genome editing><genome mutation><genome scale><genome sequencing><genome wide association><genome wide association scan><genome wide association studies><genome wide association study><genome-wide><genomewide><genomewide association scan><genomewide association studies><genomewide association study><genomic editing><genomic location><genomic locus><genomic variant><iPS><iPSC><iPSCs><induced pluripotent cell><induced pluripotent stem cell><inducible pluripotent stem cell><model generalizability><molecular array><molecular phenotype><next gen sequencing><next generation sequencing><nextgen sequencing><novel><polymorphism><promoter><promotor><single nucleotide variant><social role><statistics><tech development><technology development><tool><trait><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing><whole genome><whole genome association analysis><whole genome association studies><whole genome association study>,Biotechnology; Genetics; Human Genome
Identifying and characterizing human pulmonary neuroendocrine stem cells and their diversity,Identifying and characterizing human pulmonary neuroendocrine stem cells and their diversity,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are sensory epithelial cells that signal to the brain
through sensory neurons and locally through neuropeptides and neurotransmitters. We used
scRNA-seq to comprehensively profile and analyze mouse and human PNECs, which revealed
over 40 PNEC neuropeptides and hormones in diverse combinations. Here, we propose to map
the innervation and molecular subtypes of human pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and identify
the functional subsets in human lung, beginning with an investigation of functionally distinct
neuroendocrine stem cells. Using precision cut lung slice cultures to establish an injury model
inducing proliferation, we will identify the location of proliferative PNECs and measure their
complete transcriptomic profiles by scRNA-seq. In parallel, we will use multiplex single molecule
in situ hybridization methods to localize the human PNEC neuropeptides, identify their
combinations in situ, and their cognate receptors in human lung. Collectively, these studies will
comprehensively characterize the cellular and molecular features of human PNECs, their stem
cells and niches. PNEC expansions and ectopic pulmonary neuroendocrine cells are the
distinguishing pathologic features underlying a common form of pediatric diffuse lung disease,
neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI), which is characterized by diffuse obstructive
ventilatory defect. In adults, a pre-neoplastic condition called diffuse idiopathic pulmonary
neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) is also associated with airway obstruction and
prominent respiratory symptoms thought to be due to bioactive peptides from neuroendocrine
cells. We will identify the neuropeptide and receptor expression in pathological cell niches
during NE stem cell transformation in DIPNECH. This work establishes a molecular foundation
for the diverse clinical presentations associated with pulmonary neuroendocrine lesions and
identifies panels of neuropeptides and hormones localized to precise anatomic locations that will
provide the basis for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",<21+ years old><3-D Imaging><3D imaging><Acute><Adult><Adult Human><Afferent Neurons><Anatomic Sites><Anatomic structures><Anatomy><Asthma><Autoregulation><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Breathlessness><Bronchial Asthma><Bronchial Tree><Bronchiolitis><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Growth in Number><Cell Locomotion><Cell Migration><Cell Movement><Cell Multiplication><Cell Proliferation><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cellular Migration><Cellular Motility><Cellular Proliferation><Childhood><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Clonal Expansion><Color><Common Core><Coughing><Data><Defect><Development><Diagnosis><Diffuse><Disease><Disorder><Distal><Dyspnea><Encephalon><Endocrine Gland Secretion><Epithelial Cells><Epithelium><Exhibits><Foundations><Future><Gene Transcription><Genes><Genetic Transcription><Goals><Heterogeneity><Homeostasis><Hormones><Human><Hyperplasia><Hyperplastic><Hypoxemia><Hypoxia><Hypoxic><Image><In Situ><In Situ Hybridization><Individual><Injury><Interstitial Lung Diseases><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigation><Label><Lesion><Ligands><Location><Lung><Lung Diseases><Lung Neuroendocrine Neoplasm><Lung Respiratory System><Maps><Measures><Mediating><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><Molecular Fingerprinting><Molecular Profiling><Monitor><Murine><Mus><Nerve Transmitter Substances><Neuroendocrine><Neuroendocrine Cell><Neuroendocrine System><Neurohumor Receptors><Neuromediator Receptors><Neuropeptides><Neuroregulator Receptors><Neurosecretory Systems><Neurotransmitter Receptor><Neurotransmitters><Oxygen Deficiency><Pathologic><Patients><Pattern><Peptide Receptor><Peptides><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiological Homeostasis><Population><Preneoplastic Conditions><Progenitor Cells><Proliferating><Pulmonary Diseases><Pulmonary Disorder><Pulmonary Edema><Pulmonary Neuroendocrine Neoplasm><Pulmonary Neuroendocrine Tumor><RNA Expression><Receptor Protein><Regional Anatomy><Resolution><Respiratory Disease><Respiratory Signs and Symptoms><Respiratory System Disease><Respiratory System Disorder><Respiratory physiology><Role><Sensory><Sensory Neurons><Sentinel><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Site><Slice><Stimulus><System><Testing><Therapeutic Hormone><Three-Dimensional Imaging><Trachea><Trachea Proper><Transcription><United States><Visualization><Work><adulthood><airflow limitation><airflow obstruction><airway limitation><airway obstruction><airway symptom><biological signal transduction><cell motility><cell transformation><cellular targeting><combinatorial><daughter cell><developmental><diagnostic approach><diagnostic strategy><disease of the lung><disorder of the lung><epithelial injury><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><expression subtypes><genetic approach><genetic strategy><global gene expression><global transcription profile><human tissue><hypoxemic><imaging><in situ Hybridization Genetics><in situ Hybridization Staining Method><in vivo><infancy><infantile><injuries><injury response><innervation><lung disorder><lung edema><lung neuroendocrine tumor><molecular profile><molecular signature><molecular sub-types><molecular subsets><molecular subtypes><mouse model><murine model><nerve supply><neuroendocrine differentiation><new diagnostics><new therapeutic approach><new therapeutic intervention><new therapeutic strategies><new therapy approaches><new treatment approach><new treatment strategy><next generation diagnostics><novel diagnostics><novel therapeutic approach><novel therapeutic intervention><novel therapeutic strategies><novel therapy approach><obstructed airflow><obstructed airway><pediatric><pre-neoplastic conditions><pre-neoplastic state><preneoplastic state><progenitor cell expansion><progenitor cell population><progenitor expansion><progenitor population><programs><pulmonary><receptor><receptor expression><repair><repaired><resolutions><respiratory><respiratory airway obstruction><respiratory function><respiratory symptom><response to injury><scRNA-seq><sensor><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single molecule><single-cell RNA sequencing><social role><stem and progenitor cell expansion><stem and progenitor cell population><stem cell expansion><stem cell population><stem cells><transcriptome><transcriptomics><transformed cells><windpipe>,Lung; Neurosciences; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Human
Elucidating the Role of TGF-Beta Signaling in Craniofacial Fibrous Dysplasia of the Bone,Elucidating the Role of TGF-Beta Signaling in Craniofacial Fibrous Dysplasia of the Bone,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Craniofacial fibrous dysplasia (CFD) is a disabling skeletal disease with no curative medical therapies. It is
characterized by fibrotic, expansile bone lesions that compress surrounding craniofacial structures and cause
significant morbidity, including vision loss, hearing impairment, dysmorphic facies, fractures, pain, and dental
and jaw abnormalities. Fibrous dysplasia (FD) can affect one or more bones throughout the skeleton, but the
femur, ribs and craniofacial skeleton are the most commonly affected sites. FD is caused by a somatic, mosaic
activating mutation in GNAS, the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding
protein, Gsa, leading to constitutive activation of Gsa and elevated intracellular cAMP levels in affected tissues.
CFD can occur in isolation or in association with McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS), which is characterized by
polyostotic FD (FD affecting more than one bone), café-au-lait-skin hyperpigmentation and precocious puberty.
There are no approved medical treatment options for FD, and there is a critical need to understand the
pathways that are activated downstream of Gsa to identify potential therapeutic targets for this disabling
disease. Our single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data on cells collected from human craniofacial and non-
craniofacial FD bone lesions has identified critical signaling pathways that are up-regulated in FD, including
TGFβ signaling. TGFb signaling is critical for healthy skeletal development and repair, but when inappropriately
activated, it is a significant driver of tissue fibrosis, including pulmonary, renal and systemic fibrosis. Despite its
established role in driving fibrosis of non-skeletal tissues, the contributory role of TGFb signaling in FD bone
lesions remains unknown. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the role of TGFβ signaling in driving
the fibrotic bone phenotype seen in FD/MAS. Our central hypothesis is that TGFβ signaling is activated in
response to Gs-GPCR signaling and contributes to the fibrosis and aberrant osteogenesis seen in FD lesions.
To test our hypothesis, we will pursue 2 aims. The first aim will elucidate the mechanisms driving TGFβ signaling
in response to Gs-GPCR overactivation at a cellular level. We will use our iPSC model of FD/MAS to generate
neural crest-derived mesenchymal osteogenic lineage cells and test the effect of TGFb stimulation and inhibition
on the fibrotic profile of these cells at different developmental stages. The second aim will use an in vivo murine
model of FD in which GNASR201H is expressed in early osteoblastic lineages to test the effect of TGFβ signaling
inhibition on the development of fibrosis and impaired osteogenesis using a pan-TGFβ antibody. Upon
successful completion of this project, we aim to shed light on the interplay between Gs-GPCR and TGFβ signaling
in the skeleton and apply this knowledge to the treatment of CFD as well as more common diseases of impaired
osteogenesis such as osteoporosis, heterotopic ossification, and fracture repair. The data generated in this
proposal will be used in future grant applications to explore the role of metabolic and growth factor signaling
pathways that are dysregulated in response to constitutive Gs-signaling.","<3'5'-cyclic ester of AMP><Adenosine Cyclic 3',5'-Monophosphate><Adenosine Cyclic Monophosphate><Adenosine, cyclic 3',5'-(hydrogen phosphate)><Affect><Albright Syndrome><Albright's syndrome><Antibodies><Applications Grants><Attenuated><Automobile Driving><Blindness><Body Tissues><Bone Formation><Bone Growth><Bone Marrow Fibrosis><Bone Resorption><Bone-Derived Transforming Growth Factor><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Lineage><Cell Signaling><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cells><Clinical Trials><Collecting Cell><Coupling><Cyclic AMP><Data><Dental><Deposit><Deposition><Development><Disabling><Disease><Disorder><ECM><Ectopic Ossification><Extracellular Matrix><Facial asymmetry><Facies><Femur><Fibroblasts><Fibrosis><Fibrous Dysplasia><Fibrous Dysplasia of Bone><Fracture><Fracture Healing><Future><G Protein-Complex Receptor><G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes><G Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling><G-Protein-Coupled Receptors><GPCR><GPCR Signaling><Gene Expression><Generalized Growth><Genes><Genetic><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic defect><Goals><Grant Proposals><Growth><Growth Agents><Growth Factor><Growth Substances><Hearing Loss><Hemifacial Microsomia><Heterotopic Ossification><Histology><Human><Hypermelanoses><Hypermelanosis><Hyperpigmentation><Hypoacuses><Hypoacusis><Immunoblotting><Immunohistochemistry><Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue><Immunohistochemistry Staining Method><Impairment><In Vitro><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Jaffe-Lichtenstein syndrome><Jaw Abnormalities><Kidney><Kidney Urinary System><Knowledge><Lesion><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Maintenance><McCune Albright's Syndrome><McCune-Albright Syndrome><Medical><Mesenchymal><Metabolic><Milk Growth Factor><Modeling><Modern Man><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Mutation><Myelofibrosis><Myelosclerosis><Neural Crest><Organ><Osteitis Fibrosa Disseminata><Osteoblasts><Osteoclastic Bone Loss><Osteogenesis><Osteoporosis><Pain><Painful><Pathogenesis><Pathologic Ossification><Pathological Ossification><Pathway interactions><Phenotype><Platelet Transforming Growth Factor><Polyostotic Fibrous Dysplasia of Bone><Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia><Precocious Puberty><Proliferating><Proteins Growth Factors><Ribs><Role><Series><Signal Pathway><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Site><Skeletal Development><Skeleton><Skin><Stromal Cells><TGF B><TGF-beta><TGF-β><TGFbeta><TGFβ><Testing><Tissue Growth><Tissues><Transforming Growth Factor beta><Transforming Growth Factor-Beta Family Gene><Western Blotting><Western Immunoblotting><X-ray microtomography><Xray microtomography><adenosine 3'5' monophosphate><attenuate><attenuates><biological signal transduction><bone><bone fracture><bone fracture healing><bone fracture repair><bone quality><bone tissue formation><cAMP><co-morbid><co-morbidity><comorbidity><craniofacial><craniofacial bone><craniofacial structure><craniofacies><curative intervention><curative therapeutic><curative therapy><curative treatments><developmental><disabling disease><disease associated disability><disease model><disease-induced disability><disease-related disability><disorder model><driving><dysfunctional hearing><effective therapy><effective treatment><efficacy testing><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><fracture repair><gene synthesis><genome mutation><guanine nucleotide binding protein><hearing challenged><hearing defect><hearing deficient><hearing deficit><hearing difficulty><hearing dysfunction><hearing impairment><human data><iPS><iPSC><iPSCs><in vivo><induced pluripotent cell><induced pluripotent stem cell><inducible pluripotent stem cell><inhibitor><long bone><micro CT><micro computed tomography><microCT><microtomography><mosaic><mouse model><murine model><nano-string><nanostring><novel><ontogeny><osteoblast cell differentiation><osteoblast differentiation><osteoblastic differentiation><osteogenic><osteoprogenitor><osteoprogenitor cell><pathway><protein blotting><pulmonary><renal><repair><repaired><response><rib bone structure><scRNA-seq><serological marker><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single-cell RNA sequencing><skeletal><skeletal disease><skeletal disorder><skeletal dysplasia><skeletons><skin lesion><social role><therapeutic target><vision loss><visual loss>","Congenital Structural Anomalies; Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Disease; Genetics; Osteoporosis; Pediatric; Rare Diseases; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - Human"
Manganese exposure  and genetic diversity in risk mechanisms for neurodevelopmental disorders,Manganese exposure  and genetic diversity in risk mechanisms for neurodevelopmental disorders,"ABSTRACT
The broad, long-term objectives of the grant are to increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying
the gene x environment interactions that link developmental manganese (Mn) exposure, dopamine (DA)
dysregulation and increased frequency of ADHD diagnoses. Through the use of both sexes and varied genetic
backgrounds in our testing models (mice and human iPSC lines) we use a rigorous approach to deepen our
understanding of the role of genetics on the strength of the mechanisms under investigation. Strong
epidemiological and correlation evidence points to a relationship between overexposure to metals, including
Mn, and development of childhood and adolescent neuropsychological disorders. We will use oral exposures
to mimic exposure to Mn through poorly filtered water such as that obtained from wells, at levels relevant to
known human exposures in N. America. We will support our behavioral studies with comprehensive analyses
of dopaminergic (DAergic) function including post-mortem analyses of brain tissues, electrophysiology
approaches in live brain slices and in vitro study of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived DA
neurons. Our first Specific Aim is to Determine the role of sex and genetic background on Mn exposure-
induced behavioral change and DAergic transport deficits. Three background strains have been selected for
their baseline differences in DAergic function, Mn metabolism and locomotor activity. Mice will be exposed to
control, moderate or high Mn through water from weaning to assess the impact of sub-toxic (i.e. no expected
cell death) Mn levels in brain during development. We will use a range of behavioral outcomes that are
representative of changes observed in ADHD as well as variation observed in the general public. We will study
DA metabolism and release/reuptake kinetics through neurochemistry, post translational protein modifications,
RNA and electrophysiology approaches. In Specific Aim 2 we will Test whether Mn modifies pharmacological
modulation of DA transport in vivo. We will use genetic approaches to generate mild disturbances in the
DAergic system from birth that cause only modestly altered phenotypes (behavioral and cellular). We will then
test whether Mn exposure is sufficient to drive these mild presentations towards full expression of abnormal
phenotypes mimicking a classic gene x environmental exposure model of development of Intellectual and
Developmental Disabilities. We will further test the potential for Mn to impact efficacy of common treatments for
ADHD. Finally, in Specific Aim 3 we will determine whether Mn has an ADHD-related differential impact on DA
functional characteristics of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived DAergic neurons. We will use
cell lines derived from males and females under baseline conditions, and following genetic mutation of the DA
transporter, or exposure to chemical ADHD risk factors. We will assess changes in neurochemistry and post-
translational modifications to test the potential translational relevance of Aims 1 and 2. We will use single-cell
genetic pathway analysis to test hypotheses about which pathways are disrupted by Mn.",<0-11 years old><21+ years old><AD/HD><ADHD><Adolescent><Adolescent Youth><Adult><Adult

Hierarchical modeling and simulation to optimize cell village experimental design and the analysis of scRNA-seq data,Hierarchical modeling and simulation to optimize cell village experimental design and the analysis of scRNA-seq data,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Elucidating the genetic and environmental drivers of disease is critical to precision medicine. Advancements
in in vitro human stem cell culture are accelerating disease and therapeutic research across individuals of di-
verse genetic backgrounds. Cell villages are an e!cient platform, that pools populations of 10-100 genetically
distinct, human stem cell lines, to study how genetic variation and environment inﬂuence a spectrum of molec-
ular phenotypes. This experimental design allows researchers to apply selection and perturbation treatments to
large, ancestrally diverse cell populations, while simultaneously measuring phenotype di↵erences between donors
through molecular and omics assays. While villages show a lot of promise for uncovering Gene x Environment
(GxE) interactions and the end e↵ect on disease, two main limitations need to be addressed: (i) experimental
methods need to be reﬁned to ensure reproducibility and adequate statistical power and (ii) statistical analysis
tools need to be built to incorporate the full structure of these data. We aim to address these limitations by ﬁrst
developing standards for cell village experimental design through statistical modeling and simulation of village
donor growth. Speciﬁcally, we will test how di↵erent experimental parameters a↵ect the amount of variation in
donor growth rate estimates, the consistency of these predictions and whether experiments can maintain donor
representation over the desired time frames. These factors will be important as we want to help researchers design
experiments that minimize the variance in the growth rate estimates, while maintaining high genetic diversity
throughout the entire experiment. Using this experimentally validated simulation framework, we will build a user-
friendly tool that enables researchers to input their own preliminary data to project how di↵erent experimental
design choices might impact the signals they are able to detect in the data and if donors might drop out or take
over the population. In the second aim, we will build a hierarchical model of single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)
time series count data. The scRNA-seq pipeline will focus on two main applications: (i) a statistical tool that
addresses the sparsity in single cell time series count data while accounting for natural variation in villages, and
(ii) a tool that estimates the sequencing depth and village design needed to optimize statistical power. This
work will help researchers conduct reproducible, high powered cell village experiments while fully leveraging the
structure of the data. Improving cell village experimental and statistical methods will give researchers a powerful
platform for investigating individual disease risk and potential for speciﬁc therapeutic interventions.",<ATAC sequencing><ATAC-seq><ATACseq><Acceleration><Address><Assay><Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing><Bioassay><Biological><Biological Assay><CRISPR><CRISPR/Cas system><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Count><Cell Culture Techniques><Cell Line><Cell Number><Cell Signaling><CellLine><Cells><ChIP Sequencing><ChIP-seq><ChIPseq><Chemicals><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats><Complex><Computational toolkit><Data><Data Analyses><Data Analysis><Data Reporting><Data Set><Diathesis><Disease><Disease susceptibility><Disorder><Dropout><Drops><Ensure><Environment><Experimental Designs><Expression Signature><Gene Expression><Gene Expression Profile><Gene x Environment Interaction><Generalized Growth><Genes><Genetic><Genetic Diversity><Genetic Variation><Genetic study><Goals><Growth><GxE interaction><In Vitro><Individual><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigators><Length><Measures><Messenger RNA><Methods><Modeling><Molecular><NPC><Neural Stem Cell><Nuclear Pore Complex><Pharmaceutical Agent><Pharmaceuticals><Pharmacologic Substance><Pharmacological Substance><Phenotype><Population><Probabilistic Models><Probability Models><Reproducibility><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Sampling><Series><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Statistical Data Analyses><Statistical Data Analysis><Statistical Data Interpretation><Statistical Methods><Statistical Models><Strains Cell Lines><Structure><Techniques><Testing><Therapeutic Intervention><Therapeutic Research><Time><Tissue Growth><Toxicology><Variant><Variation><Viral><Work><assay for transposase accessible chromatin followed by sequencing><assay for transposase accessible chromatin seq><assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing><assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing><biologic><biological signal transduction><cell culture><cell cultures><cell type><chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing><computational toolbox><computational tools><computational toolset><computerized tools><cultured cell line><data interpretation><data representation><data representations><data structure><design><designing><disease risk><disorder risk><dosage><environment effect on gene><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><flexibility><flexible><gene environment interaction><gene expression pattern><gene expression signature><human pluripotent stem cell><human progenitor><human stem cells><improved><in silico><intervention therapy><liability to disease><mRNA><model-based simulation><models and simulation><molecular phenotype><nerve stem cell><neural precursor><neural precursor cell><neural progenitor><neural progenitor cells><neuron progenitors><neuronal progenitor><neuronal progenitor cells><neuronal stem cells><neuroprogenitor><ontogeny><overpopulation><pharmaceutical><power analysis><precision medicine><precision-based medicine><scRNA-seq><simulation><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single-cell RNA sequencing><statistic methods><statistical analysis><statistical linear mixed models><statistical linear models><tool><transcriptional profile><transcriptional signature><user-friendly>,Genetics; Human Genome; Precision Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Human
Investigating the Mechanism of Hair Follicle Placode Induction : A novel approach to understanding establishment of the periodic pattern,Investigating the Mechanism of Hair Follicle Placode Induction : A novel approach to understanding establishment of the periodic pattern,"In the field of regenerative medicine, while much work has been done to grow skin in culture, it has been
especially difficult to create cultured skin that is able to autonomously produce hair follicles in a biologically
accurate fashion. Optimizing a way to grow fully functional skin in culture would revolutionize the way that the
medical field utilizes skin grafts and transplants. Especially in instances where there is insufficient transplant
tissue to sample from, patients with severe burns, slow healing wounds, and advanced forms of scarring alopecia
would greatly benefit from being able to receive skin grafts and transplants derived from fully functional skin
produced in culture. Somehow, skin possesses an inherent ability to transform itself from a uniform sheet of
tissue to an elegantly decorated structure with all of its necessary appendages organized in a periodic pattern.
Several studies have been done to generate isolated follicle-like structures and even to stimulate a patch of hair
growth in stem-cell derived tissue. The few instances of induced hair growth that have been accomplished in
culture fall short of recapitulating hair follicle patterning de novo. We believe that better understanding how hair
follicles establish a periodic pattern during development will provide a strong framework for creating a way to
mimic this phenomenon in culture. In the developmental biology field, the prevailing hypotheses that have been
proposed to explain periodic pattern establishment rely heavily on local signaling and self-organization. Though,
there is insufficient experimental evidence to definitively support these hypotheses, which is also reflected in the
challenging feat to produce skin with hair follicles in culture. Data from our lab utilizing live imaging of embryonic
skin development has uncovered remarkable plasticity in hair follicle placode induction, revealing an underlying
program that ensures robust development of a periodic pattern. Informed by this data, I hypothesize that long-
distance migration mediated by Wnt signaling serves as the underlying mechanism for hair follicle placode
induction rather than being driven entirely by local activation and inhibition by diffusible ligands. I plan to test this
hypothesis by utilizing the Cre-Lox system under the control of a K14 epithelial-specific promoter to stochastically
knock out beta-catenin, an important Wnt signaling transcription factor. In this way, Wnt responsiveness will be
mosaic in that some cells will be Wnt-responsive and others will not. I will then characterize hair follicle placodes
in the mosaic Wnt-responsive system (Aim 1), determine the mechanism for how Wnt-responsive cells are able
to migrate and coalesce to form a placode (Aim 2), and determine how Wnt signaling output is refined from a
stochastic to periodic pattern in an unperturbed environment (Aim 3). This proposed project will provide
experimental evidence that has the potential to both lay the mechanistic foundation for more realistic skin culture
experiments and challenge long-standing hypotheses in the field. Through collaboration between Princeton
University, Robert Wood Johnson, and Weill Cornell Medicine, the proposed project and training plan is designed
to provide the clinical, basic science training, mentorship, and resources necessary to accomplish this goal.",<Adopted><Alopecia><Animals><Antigen-Presenting Cells><Baldness><Basal Transcription Factor><Basal transcription factor genes><Basic Research><Basic Science><Behavior><Beta Cadherin-Associated Protein><Beta-1 Catenin><Biology><Body Tissues><CUL-2><Cadherin-3><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Isolation><Cell Locomotion><Cell Migration><Cell Movement><Cell Segregation><Cell Separation><Cell Separation Technology><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cellular Migration><Cellular Motility><Chemotaxis><Cicatrix><Clinical><Collaborations><Coupled><Cre Lox technology><Cre LoxP system><Cre lox recombination><Cre lox recombination system><Cre lox system><Cre recombinase/LoxP technology><Cre system><Cues><Data><Dermatoplasties><Dermatoplasty><Development><Developmental Biology><Diffusion><Embryo><Embryo Development><Embryogenesis><Embryonic><Embryonic Development><Ensure><Environment><Epithelium><FGF20><FGF20 gene><Family><Feathers><Fibroblast Growth Factor 20><Foundations><General Transcription Factor Gene><General Transcription Factors><Generalized Growth><Genes><Goals><Grant><Growth><Hair><Hair Follicle><Hair follicle structure><Image><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Knock-out><Knockout><Knowledge><Ligands><Mediating><Medical><Medicine><Mentorship><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modeling><Molecular><Monitor><Morphogenesis><Murine><Mus><Output><P-Cadherin><PRO2286><Pathway interactions><Patients><Pattern><Pattern Formation><Periodicals><Placental Cadherin><Placental Calcium-Dependent Adhesion Protein><Reaction><Regenerative Medicine><Reporter><Research Resources><Resources><Sampling><Scars><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Skin><Skin Transplantation><Skin development><Skin graft><Specific qualifier value><Specified><Structure><Suggestion><Sweat Glands><System><Testing><Time><Tissue Growth><Tissue Transplantation><Tissues><Training><Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene><Transcription factor genes><Undifferentiated><Universities><WNT Signaling Pathway><WNT signaling><Wood><Wood material><Work><Wound Repair><accessory cell><allogenic skin graft><appendage><beta catenin><biological signal transduction><cell motility><cell sorting><cell type><design><designing><developmental><diffused><diffuses><diffusing><diffusions><epidermal progenitor><epidermal progenitor cell><epidermal stem cell><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><imaging><inhibitor><keratinocyte><migration><morphogenetic process><mosaic><mouse model><murine model><new approaches><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><ontogeny><pathway><periodic><periodical><programs><promoter><promotor><self organization><serious burns><severe burns><skin organogenesis><stem cell derived tissues><sudiferous gland><transcription factor><wound healing><wound recovery><wound resolution><β-catenin>,Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - Non-Human; Transplantation; Wound Healing and Care
High-Content Screen to Identify Small Molecule Therapeutics that Reduce Aberrant Lipid Accumulation in APOE4 Alzheimer's Disease,High-Content Screen to Identify Small Molecule Therapeutics that Reduce Aberrant Lipid Accumulation in APOE4 Alzheimer's Disease,"Project Summary: Genome-wide association studies demonstrate that the top genes associated with
increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism, inferring
lipid dysregulation is pathological. In particular, APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk for late-onset AD.
Individuals of European ancestry carrying two copies of the APOE4 allele have a sixteen-fold increase in AD risk
compared to a similar individual carrying two copies of the APOE3 allele. APOE is the primary cholesterol and
lipid transporter in the brain. Studies using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) show that APOE4 alters
cholesterol and lipid homeostasis across multiple cell types; however, its effects are especially pronounced in
oligodendrocytes—myelinating cells that insulate and protect neurons. Histological and lipidomic profiling of
human post-mortem brains and animal models shows impaired cholesterol transport and vast lipid deposits in
APOE4-expressing oligodendrocytes. This aberrant accumulation of lipids impairs myelination, impedes amyloid
plaque clearance, and increases neuroinflammation. Despite the central role of APOE4 and lipid metabolism
in AD, no therapeutics target APOE4 or aberrant lipid accumulation. MCM6 Therapeutics’ Chief Science
Advisor, Dr. Joel Blanchard, an Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt.
Sinai, has developed a drug discovery pipeline that models APOE4 lipid accumulation in human
oligodendrocytes. In a small proof-of-concept screen, we discovered two mechanistically distinct drugs,
rosiglitazone and cyclodextrin, both reduce lipid deposits in APOE4 oligodendrocytes. This reduction in
intracellular lipid accumulation restored myelination in an in vitro neuron co-culture assay and improved learning
and memory in APOE4 transgenic mice. We will further optimize and apply this high-content screening
pipeline to identify therapeutics that reduce aberrant cholesterol and lipid accumulation in human
APOE4 oligodendrocytes. Aim 1, we will adapt our screening assay to 384-well plates, and perform a targeted
screen of ~2,500 lipid modifying compounds. Our high-content image analysis platform will be conducted in
collaboration with PhenoVista. We expect the focused screening approach in Aim 1 will generate early leads and
targets that we will validate and expand on with structure-activity-relationship studies. Aim 2 we will perform a
large unbiased screen of 30,000 compounds. Hits from Aims 1 and 2 will be validated via dose titration, and
identity will be confirmed by re-ordering and MS analysis. We will perform off-target analysis, functional validation
(in vitro myelination), and neurotoxicity assays in iPSC-derived human brain tissue. Through rigorous in vitro
validation of efficacy, selectivity, and neurotoxicity, we will select 3-10 lead compounds for future evaluation in
our established APOE4 humanized mouse models through extensive histological and behavioral assays,
delivering first-in-class lead compounds that restore APOE4 brain lipid homeostasis, opening new therapeutic
opportunities in AD.",<3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><AD dementia><APOE e4><APOE-ε4><APOEε4><Acute Neuronopathic Form Niemann-Pick Disease><Acute Neurovisceral Form Niemann-Pick Disease><Affect><After

Specialized Proresolving Lipid Mediator-Enhanced Stem Cell Therapy and Tissue Regeneration,Specialized Proresolving Lipid Mediator-Enhanced Stem Cell Therapy and Tissue Regeneration,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
Periodontal disease remains a significant public health problem. Chronic unresolved inflammation in response to proinflammatory oral microbiome dysbiosis induces host-mediated destruction of the periodontal tissues. Periodontal regeneration efforts have shown limited success due to the inability to resolve inflammation. Resolution of inflammation is initiated by Specialized Proresolving lipid Mediators (SPMs). SPMs include the lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, maresins, as well as their protein conjugates, which exhibit multipronged actions that improve the outcome of inflammation-related pathologies in experimental models and clinical trials. Human periodontal ligament stem cells human (PDLSC) release SPMs to regulate immunomodulatory and pro-healing properties. Among SPMs, Maresin 1 (MaR1) displays potent actions in regulating inflammation resolution and pain, wound repair and tissue regeneration. However, there is no defined mechanism by which MaR1 induces tissue regeneration, including bone. Our proposed research will address this gap by using a systems biology approach with LM-SPM metabolipidomics, and RNA-sequencing of PDLSC to discover possible pathways modulated by MaR1 in PDLSC tissue regeneration. By utilizing the American Yorkshire Pig as a large animal regeneration model, we will test the therapeutic potential of MaR1-enhanced PDLSC therapy for regeneration of periodontal tissues for translation to humans. Three specific aims are proposed: 1) To establish MaR1 biosynthetic pathway in PDLSC. 2) To define the mechanism by which MaR1 controls tissue regeneration. 3a) To demonstrate MaR1-enhanced PDLSC-mediated periodontal regeneration in the Pig. 3b) To elucidate the impact of MaR1 on combined BMP2-PDLSC treatment in the Pig. Results from these studies will address a mission of NIDCR: ”to support the development of human disease- and injury-relevant animal models for tissue regeneration of the oral and craniofacial complex, with preference given to large animal models.” 
The candidate is a dentist-scientist and is currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Texas Health San Antonio. This proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and training plan to advance the candidate’s skills and knowledge in immunology, metabolipidomics, RNA-sequencing and translational science under the guidance of a strong team of NIH-funded scientists; Dr. Kenneth Hargreaves, Dr. Stephen Harris, Dr. Charles Serhan and Dr. George Huang. The proposal builds on the candidate’s previous research in stem cells, BMP2 and periodontium formation by integrating new areas of expertise. The plan includes a mentored phase designed to optimize learning and acquisition of new skills (K99) followed by the R00 phase, which is specifically designed to capitalize on the strengths of the applicant to develop a new path of research that will determine the role of resolution of inflammation and stem cells in BMP2 mediated regeneration. The R00 phase also includes residency training. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will position the candidate with a unique set of cross disciplinary skills that will enable her to transition to independence specializing in stem cell-based periodontal tissue regenerative therapies.",<Acceleration><Adopted><Affect><Agonist><Alveolodental Ligament><Alveolodental Membrane><American><Anabolism><Animal Model><Animal Models and

Sex dependent dysregulation of parvalbumin interneurons as a pathway to Autism Spectrum Disorder,Sex dependent dysregulation of parvalbumin interneurons as a pathway to Autism Spectrum Disorder,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Altered GABAergic interneurons have been documented following genetic and environmental perturbations in Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD) suggesting that GABAergic interneurons might be particularly susceptible and contribute to
ASD pathophysiology. We identified Caspr2, a neuronal protein to be a target of 3 monoclonal IgG derived from
mothers with anti-brain antibodies (Ab) with an ASD child, and found that ~40% of mothers with anti-brain Ab harbor
anti-Caspr2 IgG. Caspr2 expression is localized during development to proliferating progenitor cells of pyramidal
neurons in the ventricular zone and to the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) where somatostatin and parvalbumin
interneurons (PVI) arise. It is involved in stabilization of dendrites and synapses and is an ASD risk gene. Its brain
expression is similar between females and males throughout gestation. We have demonstrated that exposure in utero
to either human monoclonal anti-Caspr2 IgG or polyclonal anti-Caspr2 IgG results in male offspring with structural
and behavioral alterations. Female offspring show no such alterations. Here we focus on the immunization model in
which female mice are immunized with the extracellular domain of human Caspr2 and harbor endogenous polyclonal
anti-Caspr2 Abs throughout gestation. Male mice exposed in utero to anti-Caspr2 IgG (“Anti-Caspr2”) exhibit a specific
reduction in PVIs but not in number of other hippocampal interneurons such as somatostatin, calretinin and
cholecystokinin in the CA1 region of the hippocampus compared to adjuvant immunized control mice (“Control”). The
reduction in PVIs is evident at postnatal age P21 and is not accompanied by a reduction in total number of GABAergic
cells. The reduction in PVIs in Anti-Caspr2 male mice is not explained by a reduction in PV progenitor cells or altered
migration, as number of proliferating and apoptotic progenitor interneurons in the MGE and the number of migratory
MGE interneurons is similar between Control and Anti-Caspr2 male mice. Given the contribution of PVIs to gamma
oscillations, we implanted multi-electrodes in Anti-Caspr2 male mice, targeted to the striata oriens and pyramidale,
and calculated relative power of the gamma band. Anti-Caspr2 male mice exhibit a significant increase in mid and
high gamma oscillations. Taken together, the model permits a study of the impact of PVIs during development as they
pertain to ASD. Our hypothesis is that in utero exposure to anti-Caspr2 Abs has sex specific epigenetic effects on PVI
maturation, which contribute to network imbalance in male mice.
 We therefore propose to study:
1. Whether the reduction in PV expression in the CA1 region of the hippocampus is associated with epigenetic
 changes that disrupt the normal transcriptional profile of PVIs in male but not female Anti-Caspr2 mice.
2. When abnormal PVIs network patterns develop in Anti-Caspr2 mice and what are the functional consequence
 of disrupting PVI development using ex vivo hippocampal slices.",<0-11 years old><21+ years old><7S Gamma Globulin><ASD><Adjuvant><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><Age><Ammon Horn><Antibodies><Apical><Apoptosis><Apoptosis Pathway><Apoptotic><Autism><Autistic Disorder><Basal Transcription Factor><Basal transcription factor genes><Behavioral><Brain><Brain Nervous System><CCK><CUT&RUN><Cell Body><Cell Nucleus><Cells><Child><Child Youth><Children (0-21)><Cholecystokinin><Chromatin><Cleavage Targets and Release Using Nuclease><Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease><Connector Neuron><Cornu Ammonis><Cyclic Somatostatin><Data><Dendrites><Development><Differences between sexes><Differs between sexes><Dysfunction><Early Infantile Autism><Electrodes><Encephalon><Epigenetic><Epigenetic Change><Epigenetic Mechanism><Epigenetic Process><Equilibrium><Exhibits><Exposure to><Expression Signature><External Domain><Extracellular Domain><Female><Functional disorder><Gender Bias><Gene Expression Profile><Gene Transcription><General Transcription Factor Gene><General Transcription Factors><Genetic><Genetic Transcription><Gestation><Growth Hormone Inhibiting Factors><Growth Hormone-Inhibiting Hormone><Hippocampus><Hu-mABs><Human><IgG><Immunization><Immunize><Immunoglobulin G><Immunohistochemistry><Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue><Immunohistochemistry Staining Method><Implant><In Situ Nick-End Labeling><Infantile Autism><Intercalary Neuron><Intercalated Neurons><Interneuron function><Interneurons><Internuncial Cell><Internuncial Neuron><Kanner's Syndrome><Label><Location><Maternal antibody><Measures><Medial><Mediating><Mental disorders><Mental health disorders><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modeling><Modern Man><Mothers><Murine><Mus><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neurologic Disorders><Neurological Disorders><Neurons><Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions><Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences><Nucleus><Pancreozymin><Parvalbumins><Pathway interactions><Pattern><Phenotype><Physiologic><Physiologic pulse><Physiological><Physiopathology><Play><Predisposition><Pregnancy><Progenitor Cells><Programmed Cell Death><Proliferating><Property><Proteins><Psychiatric Disease><Psychiatric Disorder><Pulse><Pyramidal Cells><Pyramidal neuron><RNA Expression><Receptor Protein><Regulation><Regulator Genes><Regulatory Regions><Research><Risk-associated variant><Role><SRIH><SRIH-14><Sex Bias><Sex Differences><Sexual differences><Single-Nucleus Sequencing><Slice><Somatostatin><Somatostatin-14><Somatotropin Release Inhibiting Factors><Somatotropin Release-Inhibiting Hormone><Susceptibility><Synapses><Synaptic><TUNEL><Techniques><Time><Transcription><Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene><Transcription factor genes><Transcriptional Regulatory Elements><Transposase><Uropancreozymin><Ventricular><adulthood><ages><autism spectral disorder><autism spectrum disorder><autistic children><autistic spectrum disorder><balance><balance function><behavior phenotype><behavioral phenotyping><calbindin 2><calretinin><candidate identification><children on the autism spectrum><children with ASD><children with autism><children with autism spectrum disorder><compare to control><comparison control><developmental><disease risk><disorder risk><epigenetic regulation><epigenetically><excitatory neuron><exposed in utero><fetal exposure><gene expression pattern><gene expression signature><genetic regulatory element><growth hormone release inhibiting factor><hippocampal><hippocampal pyramidal neuron><humAbs><human mAbs><human monoclonal antibodies><human monoclonals><in utero exposure><intra-uterine environmental exposure><intrauterine environmental exposure><kids><male><mental illness><migration><mouse model><murine model><neural cell body><neurological disease><neuronal><neuronal cell body><new therapeutic approach><new therapeutic intervention><new therapeutic strategies><new therapy approaches><new treatment approach><new treatment strategy><novel therapeutic approach><novel therapeutic intervention><novel therapeutic strategies><novel therapy approach><offspring><pathophysiology><pathway><postnatal><postsynaptic><prenatal exposure><prenatally exposed><progenitor><progenitor cell proliferation><progenitor proliferation><psychiatric illness><psychological disorder><receptor><regulatory gene><response><risk allele><risk gene><risk genotype><risk loci><risk locus><risk variant><sNuc-Seq><sex><sex based differences><sex-dependent differences><sex-related differences><sex-specific differences><single nucleus RNA-sequencing><single nucleus seq><single-nucleus RNA-seq><snRNA sequencing><snRNA-seq><social role><soma><stem and progenitor cell proliferation><stem cell proliferation><stem cells><synapse><terminal nick end labeling><trans acting element><transcription factor><transcriptional profile><transcriptional signature><youngster>,Autism;

Identifying potential therapeutics for neurodevelopmental disorders using artificial intelligence and transcriptional data,Identifying potential therapeutics for neurodevelopmental disorders using artificial intelligence and transcriptional data,"Project Summary/Abstract
Many debilitating neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are caused by a deficiency or excess of a specific gene
product. Most of these disorders are treated at the symptomatic level, without targeting the underlying cause.
Many efforts have been made to systematically find drugs that can modulate the responsible gene product and
correct the imbalance. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, fueled by the vast amount of publicly available data,
can prioritize the most promising treatments to test.
There are tens of thousands of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) studies from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
that give a quantitative readout of many gene and drug perturbations. If a chemical changes a cell’s transcriptome
similarly or oppositely to the disruption of a specific gene, the drug might support or counteract the gene’s
function. Large-scale analyses of discrete pathway data and transcriptomic studies have been used to discover
novel protein regulators, and even successful NDD therapeutics. However, their ability to expedite screens for
NDD therapies has not been quantitatively tested. This project will use AI to curate and analyze the literature
and RNA-seq data, and predict the most likely genetic and pharmacologic regulators of single genes.
Aim 1 will assess whether a fully automated prediction pipeline effectively prioritizes regulators of methyl-CpG-
binding protein 2 (MeCP2). MeCP2 is an ideal target upon which to systematically validate predictions. It is a
dosage-sensitive protein that is widely studied and perturbed. Patients with MeCP2 deficiency (Rett syndrome)
and excess (MECP2 duplication syndrome) are given symptomatic therapies, and treatments for its imbalance
are being developed, but there is no definitive remedy, and affected individuals continue to die in childhood or
live with cognitive and motor defects. Drugs that correct the imbalance could help affected individuals, especially
if given in their infancy, before all symptoms emerge and set in. This aim will involve using neuronal lines from
an individual with Rett syndrome to test the top 20 predictions of MeCP2-regulating genes and drugs. Testing
the top treatments without any manual filtering will determine whether this predictor effectively prioritizes
successful MeCP2 regulators.
Additionally, parts of a disease signature might be pathogenic, and others protective. There thus remains a need
to find druggable subnetworks within a gene disruption signature. Aim 2 will establish a network analysis that
can find separate network modules surrounding a given gene, and drugs that specifically target those modules.
This study will identify promising treatments that can be repurposed to rescue developmental defects in
individuals with Rett syndrome, as well as genes that serve as upstream regulators of MeCP2. On a larger scale,
it will quantitatively assess the ability of AI-guided predictions to expedite the search for undiscovered drug-gene
relationships. This will save a tremendous amount of time and resources in the search for therapeutics for
monogenic NDDs, and pave the way to making more of these disorders treatable.",<AI system><Affect><Artificial Intelligence><Benchmarking><Best Practice Analysis><Biochemical Reaction><Cell Body><Cells><Cerebroatrophic Hyperammonemia><Chemicals><Childhood><Cognitive><Computer Reasoning><Data><Data Bases><Databases><Defect><Development><Disease><Disorder><Drug Targeting><Drugs><Enzymatic Reaction><Gene Cluster><Gene Expression><Gene Expression Monitoring><Gene Expression Pattern Analysis><Gene Expression Profiling><Gene Transcription><Genes><Genetic><Genetic Transcription><Grouping><Human><Immunoblotting><In Vitro><Individual><Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Knowledge><Link><Literature><Machine Intelligence><Manuals><MeCP-2 protein><MeCP2><MeCP2 Duplication Syndrome><MeCP2 protein><Medication><Metadata><Methods><Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2><Methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2><Methyl-CpG binding protein 2><Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2><Methyl-DNA binding protein MECP2><Modern Man><Molecular><Motor><Natural Language Processing><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Network Analysis><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neurodevelopmental Disorder><Neurological Development Disorder><Neuron from iPSC><Neuron from induced pluripotent stem cells><Neurons><Pathogenicity><Pathway Analysis><Pathway interactions><Patients><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Prediction of Response to Therapy><Proteins><RNA Expression><RNA Seq><RNA sequencing><RNAseq><Regulator Genes><Reporting><Research Resources><Resources><Rett Disorder><Rett Syndrome><Role><Symptoms><Techniques><Testing><Therapeutic><Time><Transcript Expression Analyses><Transcript Expression Analysis><Transcription><Transcriptional Regulatory Elements><Western Blotting><Western Immunoblotting><analyze gene expression><benchmark><data base><developmental><dosage><drug action><drug/agent><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><gene corrected><gene correction><gene expression analysis><gene expression assay><gene function><gene product><genomic correction><global gene expression><global transcription profile><groupings><iPS neurons><iPSC derived-neurons><improved><in silico><induced pluripotent stem cell neurons><infancy><infantile><interest><interventional strategy><knock-down><knockdown><knockout gene><meta data><methyl CpG-binding protein 2 duplication syndrome><natural language understanding><neurodevelopmental disease><neuronal><neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells><novel><pathway><pediatric><pharmacologic><predict therapeutic response><predict therapy response><protein blotting><protein function><regulatory gene><screening><screenings><social role><success><therapy prediction><tool><trans acting element><transcriptional profiling><transcriptome><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing><transcriptomics><treatment prediction><treatment response prediction>,Brain Disorders; Genetics; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD); Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Rare Diseases; Rett Syndrome; Women's Health Research
Novel brain-penetrant drugs for translation-targeting therapeutics of Alzheimer’s disease,Novel brain-penetrant drugs for translation-targeting therapeutics of Alzheimer’s disease,"Abstract
 Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia in older adults, is a neurodegenerative
disorder characterized by progressive decline of memory and cognition. AD is multifaceted and heterogeneous,
which prevents clear mechanistic understanding of AD pathogenesis and therefore hinders development of
effective therapeutics. Meanwhile, post-mortem epidemiology indicated that AD onset was associated with
elevated activity of the histone methyltransferase G9a (EHMT2) in diseased brain,
implicating
G9a activity-
associated pathways in AD pathogenesis. Using our c
hromatin-activity-based chemoproteomic (ChaC)
approach that enables dissection of AD heterogeneity
, we (the Chen lab) have discovered a noncanonical,
translation regulatory function of G9a in AD pathogenesis. Further, we deduced the mechanism of action of a
brain-penetrant G9a-targetd drug,
MS1262,
w
here G9a inhibition by MS1262 reversed
AD patient proteomes,
particularly the AD-disturbed expression or phosphorylation of proteins related to cognition and learning, synaptic
transmission, synaptogenesis, and hyperactive behavior. Correspondingly, intermittent
MS1262 treatment
restored cognitive and affective functions in mid/late-stage 5xFAD mice to the healthy level (p <0.0027). Thus,
we will develop a new mechanism-based AD therapeutics. TransChromix, LLC, a startup company created by
the NC Kick-Start program, and Professor Xian Chen at the UNC School of Medicine, will conduct this project.
 Our preliminary results show that MS1262 therapy of AD is clinically practical: Comparison of proteomic
analyses of MS1262-treated AD mice with human data from large cohorts of AD patients revealed that MS1262
reversed the patient proteomic landscapes that were highly correlated with AD pathology and cognitive decline.
This mouse-to-human conservation of G9a-translated AD proteomes suggests that the therapeutic effects of
MS1262 in mice could extend to AD patients. Thus, we will test the hypothesis that targeting G9a-mediated
translational mechanisms using brain-penetrant drugs is a specific and effective strategy to prevent and/or
reverse AD progression. In Phase I, we will test the hypothesis that targeting G9a-mediated translational
mechanisms using MS1262 is a specific and effective strategy to prevent and/or reverse AD progression.
Specifically, in the
MS1262
-treated AD mouse models including 5xFAD mice and other established AD mouse
models at different stages of AD progression we will (1) comprehensively determine the long-term efficacy and
the specificity of MS1262 on synaptic and cognitive function,
(2)
measure inhibitor toxicity and brain specificity
by dose range finding and pharmacokinetic studies, and (3) validate the clinical accuracy of G9a inhibitory
mechanism. In
Phase II
we will use the Phase I-optimized doses with low toxicity to test the treatment efficacy
for AD patients. Meanwhile, we will develop companion diagnostic assays to stratify patients for enhanced
therapy with high response rates. The end deliverable of phase II funding will be an FDA IND application.",<AD dementia><AD model><AD pathology><Affective><Affinity><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimer's disease model><Alzheimer's disease pathology><Alzheimer's disease patient><Alzheimer's disease therapeutic><Alzheimer's disease therapy><Alzheimer's pathology><Alzheimer's patient><Alzheimer's therapeutic><Alzheimer's therapy><Alzheimers Dementia><Amentia><Ammon Horn><Appearance><Autopsy><Behavior><Behavioral><Binding><Biotinylation><Body Surface Area><Body Tissues><Brain><Brain Diseases><Brain Disorders><Brain Nervous System><Cell Body><Cell Isolation><Cell Segregation><Cell Separation><Cell Separation Technology><Cells><Characteristics><Chromatin><Clinical><Co-culture><Cocultivation><Coculture><Coculture Techniques><Cognition><Cognitive><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Cornu Ammonis><Data><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Dementia><Development><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Dissection><Disturbance in cognition><Dose><Drug Kinetics><Drug Targeting><Drugs><Encephalon><Encephalon Diseases><Epidemiology><Exhibits><Funding><G9a histone methyltransferase><Gene Transcription><Genetic Transcription><Hippocampus><Human><Hyperactive behavior><Impaired cognition><Intracranial CNS Disorders><Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders><Learning><MT-bound tau><Measures><Mediating><Medication><Memory><Memory Loss><Messenger RNA><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Molecular Interaction><Motor Hyperactivity><Murine><Mus><Nature><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Cell><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural Transmission><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurocyte><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neurons><Onset of illness><Pathogenesis><Pathologic><Pathology><Pathway interactions><Patients><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Pharmacokinetics><Phase><Phosphorylation><Play><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Protein Phosphorylation><Proteins><Proteome><Proteomics><RNA Expression><RNA Processing><Regulatory Protein><Role><Sampling><Signal Pathway><Specificity><Synaptic Transmission><Testing><Therapeutic Effect><Tissues><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Transcription><Translating><Translational Inhibition><Translational Regulation><Translational Repression><Translations><Treatment Efficacy><alzheimer model><brain tissue><cell sorting><cell type><chemoproteomics><clinical relevance><clinically relevant><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive function><cognitive loss><cohort><companion diagnostics><cost><data management><data sharing><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><developmental><diagnostic assay><disease heterogeneity><disease onset><disorder onset><dosage><drug action><drug/agent><energy efficiency><epidemiologic><epidemiological><genetic regulatory protein><hippocampal><histone H3 methyltransferase><histone methylase><histone methyltransferase><human data><iPS><iPSC><iPSCs><improved><induced pluripotent cell><induced pluripotent stem cell><inducible pluripotent stem cell><inhibitor><innovate><innovation><innovative><intervention efficacy><mRNA><medical college><medical schools><memory decline><microtubule bound tau><microtubule-bound tau><mouse model><multiomics><multiple omics><murine model><necropsy><neural inflammation><neurodegenerative illness><neuroinflammation><neuroinflammatory><neuronal><novel><older adult><older adulthood><panomics><pathway><patient living with Alzheimer's disease><patient stratification><patient suffering from Alzheimer's disease><patient with Alzheimer's><patient with Alzheimer's disease><postmortem><prevent><preventing><primary degenerative dementia><professor><programs><protein expression><protein homeostasis><proteostasis><regulatory gene product><response><school of medicine><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><small molecular inhibitor><small molecule inhibitor><social role><stratified patient><synapse formation><synapse function><synaptic function><synaptogenesis><targeted drug therapy><targeted drug treatments><targeted therapeutic><targeted therapeutic agents><targeted therapy><targeted treatment><tau><tau Proteins><tau factor><therapeutic efficacy><therapeutically effective><therapy efficacy><translation><τ Proteins>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Dementia; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Precision Medicine
Pharmacological rejuvenation of human hematopoietic stem cells,Pharmacological rejuvenation of human hematopoietic stem cells,"Abstract/Summary
The goal of this application is to further develop a first-in-class therapeutic regimen that attenuates
aging of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Aging of hematopoiesis in older adults often
manifests as aging-associated anemia, progressive reduction in the immune response, and/or
increased incidence of myeloid malignancy. These aging associated declines are in part attributed to
the aging of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic system that sustain our life-long
production of quality red blood cells, immune cells and white blood cells. Previous studies have
established, mostly in murine models, that elevated Cdc42 activity and loss of cell polarity serve as
aging associated biomarkers for HSCs and targeting Cdc42 activity via a lead small molecule Cdc42-
activity specific inhibitor, CASIN, can dose-dependently suppress elevated Cdc42 activity and loss of
polarity of aged animals to functionally rejuvenate or attenuate aging of murine HSCs. CASIN thus has
the potential to be further developed towards clinical applications to benefit human aging. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that targeting Cdc42 activity with the drug CASIN can restored Cdc42-
regulated polarity and rejuvenate aged human HSCs ex vivo, which will benefit bone marrow HSC
transplant patients. The proposed studies will develop the proof-of-principle of an intervention to
rejuvenate aged blood forming system and validate CASIN in rejuvenating aged human HSC epigenetic
clock and function at well-defined ex vivo conditions. The proposal will also test a clinically applicable
closed circuit HSC manipulation apparatus for CASIN ex vivo treatment in future commercialization of
this technology. Upon completion of the proposed studies, we expect our product will move closer to
FDA IND filing and clinical trials in preventing or treating aging related functional decline of human
blood system to benefit the lives of older adults.",<Age><Aging><Anemia><Animals><Attenuated><Autograft><Autologous><Autologous Transplantation><Autotransplant><Biological Function><Biological

2025 Myogenesis Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar,2025 Myogenesis Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar,"Abstract
This proposal requests partial support for an international meeting on Myogenesis as part of the Gordon
Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) series to be held at the Renaissance
Tuscany Il Ciocco Resort Lucca (Barga), Italy June 7-13 2025. The international meeting on Myogenesis has
historically been viewed as one of the preeminent skeletal muscle meetings, attracting speakers and attendees
from around the world. A major goal of the 2025 Conference is to identify mechanisms that contribute to both
healthy physiological function and, when dysregulated, muscle pathology during aging or disease. Leaders in
the field will present recent unpublished data to educate conference attendees while stimulating interactive
discussion amongst the group. Additional program events including poster sessions, scheduled social events,
local outings, organized mentoring and networking tables at mealtimes, and informal gatherings in the
afternoons will ensure maximal levels of interaction between established scientists and junior
scientists/trainees: this meeting has historically been rated by attendees as extremely informal and collegial
with excellent interactions between trainees and more senior researchers. Thus, we expect the 2025
Myogenesis GRC will provide an ideal scenario to stimulate new breakthroughs in muscle biology and to
benefit attendees at every professional level. In addition, four afternoon and evening poster sessions will
stimulate interactions between all attendees. We will also provide education, networking opportunities, and
career path mentoring to junior scientists through the GRS, a two-day conference program targeting graduate
students and postdocs that takes place immediately preceding the GRC. The GRS will conduct four sessions
of talks and two poster sessions by graduate students and postdocs. Moreover, during the GRC, 4 sessions of
""poster previews"" will provide a forum for junior scientists to highlight their work and receive feedback from
other participants (approximately 50% of trainees attending will present in this forum). These activities
represent a unique opportunity for the next generation of scientists to present their research on myogenesis,
interact with their peers, and form new collaborations. Achieving these aims will place the field in a better
position to accelerate the advancement of muscle biology and thus the development of new avenues to
promote muscle health. The venue of the conference at Il Ciocco Italy offers a relaxing atmosphere conducive
to creative thinking and the exchange of ideas that will benefit attendees at every professional level. Thus, we
expect the 2025 Myogenesis Gordon Research Conference will provide both a stimulating program and an
ideal setting for attendees to advance their understanding of skeletal muscle biology.",<Acceleration><Address><Affect><Aging><Area><Atmosphere><Autoregulation><Award><Biology><Body Tissues><Career Choice><Career Path><Collaborations><Communication><Creativeness><Data><Defect><Development><Disease><Disorder><Dysfunction><Education><Educational aspects><Ensure><Epigenetic><Epigenetic Change><Epigenetic Mechanism><Epigenetic Process><Event><Feedback><Functional disorder><Gene Action Regulation><Gene Expression Regulation><Gene Regulation><Gene Regulation Process><Genetic><Goals><Health><Homeostasis><Human><Injury><International><Invertebrata><Invertebrates><Investigators><Italy><Maintenance><Mentors><Minority><Modeling><Modern Man><Muscle><Muscle Atrophy><Muscle Development><Muscle Disease><Muscle Disorders><Muscle Tissue><Muscle function><Muscular Atrophy><Muscular Development><Muscular Diseases><Myopathic Conditions><Myopathic Diseases and Syndromes><Myopathic disease or syndrome><Myopathy><Natural regeneration><Oral><Participant><Pathology><Pathway interactions><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiological Homeostasis><Physiopathology><Position><Positioning Attribute><Postdoc><Postdoctoral Fellow><Process><Progenitor Cells><QOL><Quality of life><Regeneration><Regulation><Relaxation><Renaissance><Reporting><Request for Proposals><Research><Research Associate><Research Personnel><Researchers><Resort><Role><Schedule><Scientist><Senior Scientist><Series><Skeletal Muscle><Thinking><Tissues><Voluntary Muscle><Woman><Work><career><career aspiration><career interest><career pathway><career track><cell type><cohort><community building><conference><convention><creativity><developmental><epigenetically><graduate student><in vivo><injuries><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><interest><life span><lifespan><meeting><meetings><member><muscle breakdown><muscle bulk><muscle degradation><muscle deterioration><muscle form><muscle loss><muscle mass><muscle progenitor cell><muscle stem cell><muscle wasting><muscular><muscular disorder><myogenesis><next generation><pathophysiology><pathway><peer><place fields><post-doc><post-doctoral><post-doctoral trainee><posters><progenitor cell niche><progenitor niche><programs><regenerate><research associates><social><social role><stem and progenitor cell niche><stem cell niche><stem cells><summit><symposia><symposium><thoughts>,Aging; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Embryonic - Non-Human; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - Non-Human; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human

Loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) is predominantly observed in the circulating white blood cells of older men,
suggesting a significant link to the aging process. LOY stands out as the most frequently observed non-
physiological postzygotic chromosomal alteration in the human genome. Its profound association with age and
age-related diseases presents a critical area for in-depth study to understand the broader context of aging. In
this proposal, our central focus lies in exploring the LOY-aging nexus. Utilizing both computational and hands-
on experimental strategies, we aim to achieve an integrated understanding of LOY. This encompasses novel
methodological innovations, rare variant association studies, and a meticulous probe into the mechanism binding
LOY with aging. By diving deep into this specific genome irregularity, we aspire to shed light on the intricate
effects of genetic factors that play out as we age. Our overarching goal revolves around demystifying the
interconnections between LOY, genome instability as one ages, and the onset of age-related diseases. Our
research hinges on two foundational hypotheses: first, that rare genetic variants play a pivotal role in LOY's
manifestation, shaping its appearance against the backdrop of polygenic risks set by more common variants;
and second, that LOY isn't an isolated event, but a piece in the larger puzzle of age-associated genome
instability. These suppositions draw strength from our preliminary data, garnered using SNP array genotyping
and whole exome sequencing from the Einstein longevity cohort. This invaluable dataset previously enabled us
to identify links between rare genetic variants and exceptional human longevity. We now set forth three distinct
aims: to ascertain the extent of LOY mosaicism using sequencing data; to pinpoint genes heightening LOY risk;
and, most crucially, to decode the relationship between LOY and aging. We firmly believe that a holistic
understanding of LOY's genetic blueprint and the mechanics tying it to aging will serve as a gateway to
understanding age-related pathology. A deeper insight into LOY will not only allow for precise quantification but
also pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies, potentially offering a novel approach to mitigate the
challenges of aging and age-associated diseases.",<AD dementia><Aberrant Chromosome><Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus><Age><Age of Onset><Age related macular degeneration><Age related

Investigating single-T cell atopic gene networks in Asian and Hispanic genetic backgrounds,Investigating single-T cell atopic gene networks in Asian and Hispanic genetic backgrounds,"Investigating single-T cell atopic gene networks in Asian and Hispanic genetic backgrounds
Project Summary/Narrative
Immunomodulatory therapies now robustly improve atopic dermatitis, based on selective targeting of cytokine
pathways. However, no immune cell-specific molecular biomarkers can currently differentiate disease states at
the level of individual patients or genetic ancestries, to help guide treatment selection. Our long-term objective
is to understand causes and effective treatments for atopic dermatitis in Asian and Hispanic genetic
backgrounds. The objective of this proposal is to identify genetic biases in, and functionally characterize, a set
of abnormally elevated transcripts in atopic dermatitis skin T cells, which we recently discovered in a cohort of
Asian and Hispanic patients. Our central hypothesis is that transcriptional abnormalities in skin-resident T cells
are upstream, causative drivers in atopic dermatitis and once validated, represent candidate biomarkers for
drug response. The rationale underlying this proposal is that prior work suggests that non-European cohorts
develop atopic dermatitis via genetic pathways outside canonical Th2/Tc2 signaling, a model not supported by
our preliminary data. We will validate our abnormal atopic T cell signature in Asian and Hispanic cohorts and
experimentally test our hypothesis that specific genes in this signature can produce a Th2 cell identity. We will
pursue these aims using innovative technical approaches that include both CRISPR/Cas9-based gene
activation in primary T cells and single-cell spatial transcriptomics, bringing new capabilities to the skin
immunology field. Our proposal is significant because it investigates patient-level biomarkers in atopic
dermatitis T cells in diverse genetic backgrounds. The expected outcome of this proposal is a population- and
mechanism-validated set of genetic abnormalities that typify atopic dermatitis in Asian and Hispanic patients.
These data will have a positive impact on clinical treatments because they will guide treatments to reduce the
substantial morbidity and economic impact stemming from atopic dermatitis in non-European patients.","<Address><Antibodies><Asian><Atopic Dermatitis><Atopic Eczema><Atopic Neurodermatitis><B Cell Differentiation Factor I Gene><B-Cell Stimulatory Factor 1 Gene><BSF-1 Gene><BSF1 Gene><Basal Transcription Factor><Basal transcription factor genes><Beta-TG><Biological Markers><Biology><CRISPR approach><CRISPR based approach><CRISPR method><CRISPR methodology><CRISPR technique><CRISPR technology><CRISPR tools><CRISPR-CAS-9><CRISPR-based method><CRISPR-based technique><CRISPR-based technology><CRISPR-based tool><CRISPR/CAS approach><CRISPR/Cas method><CRISPR/Cas technology><CRISPR/Cas9><CRISPR/Cas9 technology><CTAP III><CTAP3><CTAPIII><CXC Chemokine Ligand 7><CXCL7><Cas nuclease technology><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Isolation><Cell Segregation><Cell Separation><Cell Separation Technology><Cell Signaling><Cells><Chromosomal, Gene, or Protein Abnormality><Chronic><Clinical><Clinical Treatment><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats approach><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats method><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats methodology><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technique><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology><Connective Tissue-Activating Peptide III><Cutaneous><Cutaneous Disorder><Cytogenetic or Molecular Genetic Abnormality><Cytokine Signal Transduction><Cytokine Signaling><Data><Data Set><Dermatoses><Detectable Residual Disease><Disease><Disorder><Disseminated Neurodermatitis><Drugs><EDF Gene><Enhancer-Binding Protein GATA3><Eosinophil Differentiation Factor Gene><Epidermis><Future><GATA-3 factors><GATA-3 protein><GATA-Binding Protein 3><GATA3><GATA3 gene><GATA3 protein><GATA3 transcription factor><Gene Abnormality><Gene Activation><Gene Transcription><General Transcription Factor Gene><General Transcription Factors><Genes><Genetic><Genetic Abnormality><Genetic Transcription><Genomics><Germ Lines><Goals><Grant><Health><Hispanic><Homolog of Drosophila TWIST 1><Homolog of Drosophila TWIST1><Human><IL-13><IL-13 binding protein><IL-13 receptor><IL-13R><IL-4 Gene><IL-5 Gene><IL13><IL4><IL4 gene><IL5><IL5 gene><Immune><Immune Modulation Therapy><Immunes><Immunofluorescence><Immunofluorescence Immunologic><Immunology><Inflammation><Inflammatory><Interleukin 5 (Colony-Stimulating Factor, Eosinophil) Gene><Interleukin 5 Precursor Gene><Interleukin-13><Interleukin-4 Gene><Interleukin-4 Precursor Gene><Interleukin-5 Gene><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigation><Knock-out><Knockout><Knowledge><LA-PF4><Laboratories><Link><Medication><Minimal Residual Disease><Mission><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><Molecular Abnormality><Morbidity><Morbidity -

Cell State Network-Directed Therapy,Cell State Network-Directed Therapy,"ABSTRACT—Cell State Network-Directed Therapy
Drug resistance is a significant challenge in cancer therapy and has historically been addressed from “one step
behind”, whereby drug(s) become progressively ineffective, resistance mechanism(s) are studied, and then
different drug(s) are used. While genetic and other resistance pathways are well-appreciated, so-called cell state
plasticity is increasingly understood to be a major determinant of resistance. Cell state is typically defined by a
transcriptome pattern, and plasticity is mediated largely by dynamic epigenetic transitions that mimic
developmental or tissue homeostasis programs. The different cell states along with the transitions between them
comprise a cell state network. Because different cell states can have unique drug sensitivities and resistances,
and cells can change state dynamically through the network, cell state networks provide flexible resistance
mechanisms. This proposal seeks to design therapies based on cell state network dynamics, such that drug
sensitive states are promoted while limiting transitions to drug-resistant states. However, an agnostic
experimental screening approach for drug combinations is extremely challenging, even considering just two
drugs and the hundreds of FDA-approved anti-cancer compounds, not to mention inter-patient heterogeneity,
doses, and timing/sequence. Computational models that predict how tumor cell populations respond to drug
combinations could help fill this gap, but so far this has been a challenging problem, even for modern machine
learning methods. Our preliminary work shows combining knowledge of cell state transition network dynamics
and single drug dose responses could enable computational prediction of how varied drug combinations
influence cell population growth dynamics, and how a sufficient and attainable set of data enables unique
inference of cell state networks. These motivate our proposal to predict and test “cell state network-directed”
therapies, with particular focus on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a brain tumor with poor survival and few
treatment options. We propose four Aims to study 3 different patient-derived xenograft models of GBM with in
vivo-like tumor-chip systems: Aim 1. Develop Glioma Cell State Network Models; Aim 2. Determine How
Microenvironmental Factors Alter Cell State Networks; Aim 3. Determine How Glioma Cell State Networks
Respond to Single Drugs; and Aim 4. Evaluate Model-Predicted Combination Therapies in Cell Culture and
Tumor Chips. We will combine computational modeling with state-of-the-art single cell RNAseq, spatial
transcriptomics, and flow cytometry to characterize cell state networks in gliomas and their dynamics, and how
they respond to a variety of glioma-relevant chemotherapy drugs. We will then use these models to propose
efficacious regimens that not only control growth but favorably modulate cell state transitions, and test them
using in-vivo like tumor chips. Furthermore, we will study how spatial arrangements of cell types and co-cultures
with primary neurons influence glioma behavior. Although the application is GBM, cell state networks are a
universal feature of cancer so findings here may have widespread significance across human cancers.",<3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><Address><Affect><Anti-Cancer Agents><Antineoplastic Agents><Antineoplastic Drugs><Antineoplastics><Assay><Astrocytes><Astrocytus><Astroglia><Autoregulation><BBB penetration><Bar Codes><Behavior><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Body Tissues><Brain Neoplasia><Brain Neoplasms><Brain Tumors><Cancer Drug><Cancer Treatment><Cancers><Cell Body><Cell Communication><Cell Culture Techniques><Cell Cycle><Cell Division Cycle><Cell Interaction><Cell model><Cell-to-Cell Interaction><Cells><Cellular model><Cerebral endothelium><Co-culture><Cocultivation><Coculture><Coculture Techniques><Combined Modality Therapy><Computer Models><Computerized Models><Data><Data Set><Death Rate><Development><Dose><Drug Combinations><Drug Targeting><Drug resistance><Drugs><Epigenetic><Epigenetic Change><Epigenetic Mechanism><Epigenetic Process><Event><FDA approved><Flow Cytofluorometries><Flow Cytofluorometry><Flow Cytometry><Flow Microfluorimetry><Flow Microfluorometry><Generalized Growth><Genetic><Glial Cell Tumors><Glial Neoplasm><Glial Tumor><Glioblastoma><Glioma><Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm><Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor><Grade IV Astrocytoma><Growth><Heterogeneity><Homeostasis><Human><Hybrids><Image><Immunofluorescence><Immunofluorescence Immunologic><Knowledge><Least Squares><Least-Squares Analyses><Least-Squares Analysis><Malignant Cell><Malignant Neoplasm Therapy><Malignant Neoplasm Treatment><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Measurement><Mediating><Medication><Mesenchymal><Methods><Modeling><Modern Man><Modernization><Monitor><Multimodal Therapy><Multimodal Treatment><NPC><Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neural Stem Cell><Neurocyte><Neuroglial Neoplasm><Neuroglial Tumor><Neurons><Nuclear Pore Complex><PDX model><Pathway interactions><Patient derived xenograft><Patients><Pattern><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Physical assessment><Physiological Homeostasis><Population><Population Growth><Probability><Proteins><Publishing><RNA Seq><RNA sequencing><RNAseq><Regimen><Resistance><Sorting><System><Temodal><Temodar><Testing><Time><Tissue Growth><Tissues><Tumor Cell><Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents><Update><Work><anti-cancer><anti-cancer drug><anti-cancer therapy><astrocytic glia><barcode><blood-brain barrier penetration><bloodbrain barrier penetration><brain endothelium><cancer cell><cancer drug resistance><cancer therapy><cancer-directed therapy><cell culture><cell cultures><cell type><chemotherapy><clinical relevance><clinically relevant><combination therapy><combined modality treatment><combined treatment><computational modeling><computational models><computer based models><computer based prediction><computerized modeling><cortical endothelium><design><designing><developmental><discrete time><drug resistant><drug sensitivity><drug-sensitive><drug/agent><epigenetically><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><flexibility><flexible><flow cytophotometry><glial-derived tumor><glioblastoma multiforme><glioma cell line><global gene expression><global transcription profile><imaging><in vivo><intervention design><kinase inhibitor><live cell image><live cell imaging><live cellular image><live cellular imaging><machine learning based method><machine learning method><machine learning methodologies><malignancy><markov model><methazolastone><monolayer><mortality rate><mortality ratio><multi-modal therapy><multi-modal treatment><neoplasm/cancer><neoplastic cell><nerve stem cell><network models><neural precursor><neural precursor cell><neural progenitor><neural progenitor cells><neuroglia neoplasm><neuroglia tumor><neuron progenitors><neuronal><neuronal progenitor><neuronal progenitor cells><neuronal stem cells><neuroprogenitor><oligodendrocyte precursor><oligodendrocyte progenitor><oligodendrocyte stem cell><ontogeny><organ on a chip><organ on chip><pathway><patient derived xenograft model><phospho-proteomics><phosphoproteomics><predictive modeling><programs><resistance mechanism><resistance to Drug><resistance to cancer drugs><resistant><resistant mechanism><resistant to Drug><resistant to cancer drugs><response><scRNA-seq><screening><screenings><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single-cell RNA sequencing><spongioblastoma multiforme><standard of care><temozolomide><theories><therapy design><three dimensional><transcriptome><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing><transcriptomics><treatment design><tumor><tumors in the brain>,Brain Cancer; Brain Disorders; Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Human Genome; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases
Development of CD4 TCR-engineered T cell immunotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer,Development of CD4 TCR-engineered T cell immunotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer,"Abstract
Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths of women in the United States and worldwide.
Immunotherapy is a promising approach, but has not proven successful yet in metastatic breast cancer,
particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is the most aggressive subtype among all breast cancer
subtypes, with little treatment options available. First-line treatment with pembrolizumab–chemotherapy results in
better overall survival than chemotherapy alone among patients with advanced TNBC. Sacituzumab Govitecan is
offered as an option for the second line of treatment. Despite these significant progresses, most patients eventually
collapse and die without further treatment option. Thus, TNBC remains an unmet medical need for urgent
development of novel therapeutics. The rationale for this application is that clinical responses to immune
checkpoint therapy rely on the presence of tumor-infiltrating and antigen-specific T cells. Thus, development of
tumor-specific TCR-T cell immunotherapy is key to the success of immunotherapy in breast cancer. Immunova
Therapeutics is a startup company with the mission to further develop TCR-T cell immunotherapy for the treatment
of solid cancers, including TNBC. Due to the nature of tumor heterogeneity, antigen loss or negative tumor variants
represents a key mechanism to develop resistance to immunotherapy. This IMT-422 product is an HLA-DR13-
restricted KK-LC-1-specific TCR-engineered CD4+ T cells, and has been demonstrated to completely inhibit or
even eliminate TNBC in a mouse model. Our finding is also supported by recent studies showing that CD4+ T cells
could eliminate antigen-positive and -negative tumor cells. To further improve the therapeutic potential, we
engineered TCR with three key technologies to increase the pools of stem-like memory T cells and resistance to
T cell exhaustion and immune suppression. We named the final IMT-422 product as CD4 TCR-STEM T cells,
which could completely reject breast cancer growth in a mouse model. Based on these solid data, we propose to
generate GMP grade Master Cell Bank (MCB) and viral particles of TCR-STEM required for Chemistry,
Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) (Aim 1); and determine the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and
pharmacological toxicity of the IMT-422 (CD4 TCR-STEM T cells) product (Aim 2). Upon completion of the
proposed studies, we are well positioned to initiate and file an investigator-initiated new drug (IND) application for
a future phase I clinical trial, thus accelerating the development of new breast cancer immunotherapy.",<70 kDa zeta-associated protein><Acceleration><Address><Antigenic

ACVR1 sensory neuron-specific signaling in neuropathic pain and injury-induced heterotopic ossification,ACVR1 sensory neuron-specific signaling in neuropathic pain and injury-induced heterotopic ossification,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Debilitating pain, a hallmark of tissue injury and neuropathy, is an unmet clinical challenge particularly in
musculoskeletal diseases, such as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur following orthopedic surgery
and traumatic injuries, manifests with pathological bone formation in muscle and connective tissues. However,
little progress has been made in developing effective treatments for either HO or its associated pain.
Persistent neuropathic pain can arise from hyperexcitability of sensory neuron nociceptors in dorsal root
ganglia (DRG), which release neuropeptides, interact with immune cells, and modulate the host response
after injury to innervated tissues including bone and muscle. A critical link between bone homeostasis and
neuropathic pain has been suggested by the impaired ossification and bone loss in mice lacking Trpv1+
nociceptors. Although the mechanisms that underlie HO formation or HO related pain are poorly understood,
important insights derive from studies of an hereditary HO subset, namely Fibrodysplasia Ossificans
Progressiva (FOP). FOP is commonly caused by an arginine206 to histidine gain-of-function point mutation in
the BMP type I receptor (ACVR1, also known as ALK2) in 97% of patients. We recently found that adult
patients with FOP have baseline heat and mechanical hypersensitivity, in the absence of an inflammatory
flareup. Utilizing FOP patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived nociceptive sensory neurons
(iSNs), we demonstrated that ACVR1R206H is both necessary and sufficient for the hyperexcitability of
nociceptors, a hallmark of neuropathic pain. To determine whether neuronal ACVR1 hyperactivity is also
relevant to more common neuropathic pain conditions, we conditionally expressed activating Acvr1R206H in
sensory neurons of non-FOP transgenic mice. This led to a remarkable recapitulation of the mechanical and
heat hypersensitivity in patients with FOP. As Acvr1 expression is profoundly increased in axotomized DRG
neurons in a traditional preclinical model of neuropathic pain produced by spared nerve injury (SNI), we found
that inhibiting injury-induced active neuronal ACVR1 signaling in the DRG by intrathecal (IT) injections of a
small-molecule ACVR1/ALK2 kinase inhibitor prevented injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and, most
importantly, reversed persistent pain in the mouse SNI model. Based on our observation that trauma-induced
HO triggered massive nociceptor sprouting at the injury site in a preclinical mouse model of FOP, we further
hypothesize that active ACVR1 signaling in sensory neurons is a critical link between neuropathic pain and
HO. Together, aiming to elucidate the mechanisms downstream of active ACVR1 signaling, mechanisms that
may be shared by other chronic pain and musculoskeletal injury conditions; while developing new treatment

A non-viral CRISPR-mediated genome editing delivery platform as a potential therapy for neurogenetic diseases,A non-viral CRISPR-mediated genome editing delivery platform as a potential therapy for neurogenetic diseases,"Genome editing holds great promise for the treatment of many genetic diseases; however its application in the
clinic has been slow due to the lack of the safe delivery tools and significant cost and time investment required
to custom-develop individual therapies. In our SCGE program phase 1 study, we developed a chemically
modified ribonucleoprotein (cRNP)-based gene delivery system that specifically targets neuronal cells
throughout the brain after intrathecal (IT) administration. The overarching goal of this application is to apply this
novel gene editing technology towards the treatment of two severe neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD):
Angelman syndrome (AS) and H1-4 syndrome (HIST1H1E syndrome). AS is a devastating neurodevelopmental
disease caused by the deficiency of the maternal and brain specific imprinting UBE3A gene in human
chromosome 15q11-q13 region. The structure of UBE3A is intact in the paternal chromosome in all AS cases
but transcriptionally repressed by a non-coding and antisense RNA of UBE3A (UBE3A-ATS) mediated
mechanism. It has been shown convincingly that reduction of UBE3A-ATS by antisense oligo (ASO),
topoisomerase inhibitors, and virus delivered Cas9 gene editing can de-repress the expression of UBE3A and
correct the abnormal neurological phenotypes in AS mouse models. H1-4 syndrome is caused by a gain of
function mechanism due to a mutated protein with aberrant C-terminal frameshift tail (CFT). H1-4 syndrome has
similar but milder clinical features than AS. There is no effective intervention for H1-4 syndrome. Thus, a long-
term molecular therapy for AS and H1-4, as well as other NDDs is urgently needed. In our preclinical study using
a well validated AS mouse model, we demonstrated that a single IT delivery of Ube3a antisense-targeting
RNP/Cas9efficiently de-represses the expression of Ube3a from the paternal chromosome, leading to correction
of neurobehavioral phenotypes. Similarly, the knockdown of H1-4 CFT rescue the abnormal phenotypes in H1-
4 humanized mice. We propose our cRNP-based platform for the treatment of AS and H1-4 syndrome utilizing
the same genome editor (CRISPR), delivery system (cRNPs), route (IT), target cell type (neurons), therapeutic
mechanism (genetic inactivation) and overall trial design. We have assembled an outstanding team from Yale
and Rush University with strong and complementary expertise in the areas of preclinical, IND enabling studies,
and clinical trials. The success of this study will lead to the first ever gene editing based therapy for AS and H1-
4. More importantly, it will support a paradigm shift for genome editing; rapidly expanding the number of
neurogenetic diseases treated by in vivo gene editing and accelerating the transition of genome editing
technology into clinical applications.",<0-11 years old><17 year old><17 years of age><21+ years old><Acceleration><Adopted><Adult><Adult Human><Angelman Syndrome><Animals><Anti-sense RNA><Antisense

The role of HIV Vif in clonal hematopoiesis and malignant transformation (HIV-Associated Cancers in Aging Populations),The role of HIV Vif in clonal hematopoiesis and malignant transformation (HIV-Associated Cancers in Aging Populations),"We accrue somatic mosaicism with age in many tissues. In the blood system, this is called clonal hematopoiesis
(CH). CH is a premalignant condition in which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) accrue 1-2 mutations among
~20 genes such as DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1. The CH clone size and the rate at which clones expand, which
are promoted by external factors such as inflammation, are strong predictors of malignant transformation of CH
into hematologic malignancies. Consistently, inflammation has been shown to promote the progression of CH to
hematologic malignancies. HIV-infected patients exhibit signatures of enhanced inflammation, such as activated
immune cells and cytokine expression, even when the patients are treated with antiretroviral therapies (ART).
Indeed, people living with HIV (PLWH) have higher incidence of CH, particularly those with ASXL1 mutations,
than HIV negative population. Notably, PLWH have a higher risk of developing hematologic malignancies such
as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), suggesting an association between
the elevated CH prevalence among PLWH and its malignant transformation. The fact that PLWH treated with
ART have high incidence of CH raises a possibility that HIV infection promotes CH independently of viral load or
inflammation. HIV-infected human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been found in PLWH, further
supporting the possibility that HIV infection may alter HSC function cell intrinsically to confer competitive
advantages to mutant HSCs. The objective of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underpinning
the increased prevalence of CH and its transformation to malignancies among PLWH. In Aim 1, we will study
whether Asxl1 mutant HSCs expands upon HIV infection. In Aim 2, we will examine whether HIV infection
transforms Asxl1 mutant HSCs to myeloid neoplasms. Completion of this study will provide novel insights into
the effects of HIV infection on clonal expansion and subsequent transformation of Asxl1 mutant HSCs.",<AIDS><AIDS Virus><AIDS associated cancer><AIDS related cancer><AIDS-Related Malignancy><AIDS-Related Malignant Neoplasm><AIDS-associated malignancies><AML - Acute Myeloid Leukemia><AML/MDS><AML1><AMLCR1><Acquired Immune Deficiency><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia><Acute Myelocytic Leukemia><Acute Myelogenous Leukemia><Age><Aging><Assay><Attenuated><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Blood><Blood Precursor Cell><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Body Tissues><Bone Marrow Grafting><Bone Marrow Transplant><Bone Marrow Transplantation><CBFA2><CRISPR><CRISPR/Cas system><Cancers><Cell Body><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Clonal Expansion><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats><DNMT3a><Deceleration><Development><Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes><Elderly><Exhibits><Gene Transcription><Genes><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic Transcription><Genetic defect><HIV><HIV Genome><HIV Infections><HIV Seronegativities><HIV Seronegativity><HIV negative><HIV-1><HIV-1 genome><HIV-Associated Cancer><HIV-I><HIV-associated malignancy><HIV-related malignancy><HIV/AIDS-associated malignancy><HIV/AIDS-related cancer><HIV1><HIV1 genome><HSC expansion><HTLV-III Infections><HTLV-III Seronegativities><HTLV-III Seronegativity><HTLV-III-LAV Infections><Hematologic Cancer><Hematologic Malignancies><Hematologic Neoplasms><Hematological Malignancies><Hematological Neoplasms><Hematological Tumor><Hematopoiesis><Hematopoietic Cancer><Hematopoietic Cellular Control Mechanisms><Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells><Hematopoietic stem cells><Human><Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections><Human immunodeficiency virus 1><Immune><Immunes><Incidence><Inflammation><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><LAV-HTLV-III><Length><Life Expectancy><Life Extension><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Malignant><Malignant - descriptor><Malignant Hematologic Neoplasm><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Marrow Transplantation><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><Monitor><Mosaicism><Murine><Mus><Mutant Strains Mice><Mutate><Mutation><Myelodysplastic Disease><Myelodysplastic Syndromes><Myeloid Disease><Myeloid Malignancy><Myeloid Neoplasm><Myeloid Tumor><Myeloproliferative Disorders><Myeloproliferative Tumors><Myeloproliferative disease><Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma><Nonhodgkins Lymphoma><PEBP2A2><PEBP2aB><Patients><Persons><Population><Precancerous Conditions><Premalignant Condition><Premalignant State><Prevalence><Prognosis><Proteins><RNA Expression><RUNX1><RUNX1 gene><Refractory Anemia with an Excess of Blasts><Refractory anaemia with excess blasts><Regulatory Protein><Research><Resistance><Risk><Risk Assessment><Role><Sampling><Smoldering Leukemia><Structural Protein><Subcellular Process><System><Testing><Texas><Tissues><Transcription><Transplantation><Viral Burden><Viral Load><Viral Load result><Virus-HIV><acute granulocytic leukemia><acute myeloid leukemia><acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome><advanced age><age associated><age associated effects><age correlated><age dependent><age effect><age linked><age related><age related effects><age specific><ages><aging effect><antiretroviral therapy><antiretroviral treatment><attenuate><attenuates><blood cell formation><blood cell progenitor><blood progenitor><blood stem cell><blood stem cell expansion><blood-forming stem cell><cell type><cytokine><developmental><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><genetic regulatory protein><genome mutation><geriatric><global gene expression><global transcription profile><hDNA methyltransferase 3a><hematopoietic progenitor><hematopoietic stem cell expansion><hematopoietic stem progenitor cell><hemopoietic progenitor><hemopoietic stem cell><high risk><impact of age><improved><influence of age><inhibitor><insight><interventional strategy><malignancy><mosaic diseases><mosaic disorders><mouse model><mouse mutant><murine model><mutant><myelodysplasia><myeloproliferative neoplasm><neoplasm/cancer><non-Hodgkins disease><novel><precancerous state><pressure><progenitor cell function><progenitor function><regulatory gene product><resistant><senior citizen><social role><sor Gene Products><stem and progenitor cell function><stem and progenitor function><stem cell function><transcriptome><transplant><vif Gene Products><vif Protein>,Aging; Cancer; Clinical Research; Genetics; HIV/AIDS; Hematology; Infectious Diseases; Rare Diseases; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Human; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human
Mechanisms of Persistent Inflammasome Activation in Myeloid Cells,Mechanisms of Persistent Inflammasome Activation in Myeloid Cells,"ABSTRACT
Persistent immune activation is the defining feature of HIV-1 infection in vivo and a driver of progression to end-
stage AIDS. Systemic immune activation in people living with HIV (PWH) has been hypothesized to account for
higher incidence of chronic inflammatory diseases, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND).
Importantly, numerous studies have demonstrated that populations living with opioid-use disorder (OUD) have
a higher occurrence of comorbid HIV infection, suggesting both potential socio-economic and neurocognitive
influence. This comorbidity of OUD and HIV has also been shown to increase neuroinflammation and exacerbate
the progression of HIV infection and HAND. The proposal will primarily focus on macrophages and CNS-resident
innate immune cell, microglia, which both serve as the primary virus reservoirs in the CNS. While some studies
have investigated the interactive effects of OUD and HAND in myeloid cells of non-human origin or transgenic
rodent models, the molecular mechanisms linking the two conditions in primary human microglia is still largely
unknown. Hence, we believe, this proposal fulfills a critical unmet need by establishing primary human iPSC-
derived microglia cultures to systematically interrogate the effect of HIV infection and opioids on inflammasome
activation. This application will attempt to delineate the molecular mechanisms by which HIV-1 infection activates
inflammasome activation in microglia and how opioid exposure degrades auto-inhibitory mechanisms that
restrain spontaneous activation of the inflammasome, and is responsive to the FOA, “Targeting
Inflammasomes in Substance Abuse and HIV (RFA-DA-24-003)”. We will utilize detailed molecular and
mechanistic analysis to identify the microglia-intrinsic pathway that primes and activates NLRP1 inflammasome
upon co-exposure to HIV and opiates. Specifically, we will determine if HIV-1 intron-containing RNA (icRNA)
expression and binding of HIV-1 icRNA by NLRP1 in microglia induces inflammasome activation. We will next
determine if opioid exposure enhances expression of HIV icRNA in microglia and promotes a cellular danger
state to erode negative regulatory mechanisms that prevent spurious NLRP1 inflammasome activation in
microglia. We postulate that these proposed experiments will identify a microglia-intrinsic mechanism of NLRP1
inflammasome activation driven by HIV icRNA expression and opioid exposure that fuels neuroinflammation and
HAND. Importantly, results from these studies will inform future therapeutic development to prevent HIV and
opiate-induced neuroinflammation and prevent development of HAND in HIV+ substance use population.",<AIDS><AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome><Acquired Immune

Mucosal B-cell aging in PLWH,Mucosal B-cell aging in PLWH,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Overall, the world population is aging and in the era of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) people living with HIV
(PLWH) live longer. ART has converted HIV infection into a survivable chronic infection; however,
comorbidities are a mounting clinical reality, likely related to accelerated immunosenescence. It is well
documented that HIV infection leads to accelerated aging, and HIV-1 chronic infection is considered a good
model for studying immunosenescence. The impact of aging on increased susceptibility to infections and
reduced responsiveness to vaccines is a well-known clinical problem. Antibodies are one of the first and most
important responses against pathogens and the reason for this dampened immune response with aging may
be due to age-related reduced humoral immunity (B cell immunosenescence). Humoral immunity has been
understudied in humans, particularly in lymphoid tissue, due to the difficulty of sample availability. It is not clear
how accurately changes observed in blood reflect immunosenescence processes in tissues, especially the
gastrointestinal mucosa which contains most of the body’s lymphocytes (~60%) and it is a region of high
antigen exposure. Therefore, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) represents a good model to study
lymphoid tissue in humans that is highly exposed to antigen stimulation. A growing body of literature has begun
to reveal the pathophysiological processes driving immune dysfunction of T cells, including work by our team,
which has studied the human mucosal immune compartment. It is not well understood how aging depresses
humoral immunity and there are little or no studies on humoral immunity in the mucosal immune compartment.
Compared to blood, gut mucosa contains fewer naïve cells, more activated memory cell, and more antibody
secreting cells, consistent with the high level of antigen exposure. Therefore, in this study, we propose to
analyze the individual and combined impact of age and HIV-1 on immunosenescence of humoral
immunity, especially in the highly immune active gastrointestinal tract, by quantifying B-cell immune
aging in GALT and peripheral blood in PLWH, as a model of accelerated aging, and in people without
HIV (PWOH). Our hypothesis is that natural aging and HIV-1-induced-accelerated aging diminishes the
capacity of the immune system to produce efficient antibody responses in the periphery and GALT; this will be
a result of inappropriate accumulation of memory-effector T-cells fueled by chronic persistent viral infections,
causing ineffective follicular helper T-cells, inefficient recall of cytotoxic responses, and a generalized,
persistent low-level inflammatory state. The Specific Aims to test this hypothesis are: Aim 1: To determine
age-related B cell lymphocyte senescence in the GALT versus peripheral blood compartments of PWOH and
PLWH ranging in age from 18 to ≥60-65 years. We will also study the functional aspects of B cells in terms of
antibody production and B cell receptor repertoire. Aim 2: To determine if the accelerated B lymphocyte
senescence seen in GALT affects humoral responses, using SARS-CoV-2 as a neoantigen challenge model.","<19S Gamma Globulin><2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><2019-nCoV S

Expansion of an established breeding SPF Program at CPRC,Expansion of an established breeding SPF Program at CPRC,"SUMMARY
The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is the most commonly used nonhuman primate model in biomedical
research. Nonhuman primate models are of growing importance for HIV/AIDS-related research to develop
vaccines, therapeutic interventions a potential cure and other approaches. However, it is well-known that the
demand by the research community of rhesus macaques, remains greater than their availability. The CPRC have
been critical for maintaining the momentum of NIH-supported. Over the last three years (2020-2023), 700
animals (app 230/year) have been available from this program supporting $57,866,376 of NIH-high priority
HIV/AIDS-research, mainly R01, P01, U01- funded academic investigators and NIAID-DAIDS-SVEU programs.
This NOFO presents an opportune moment to bolster CPRC's SPF program, aiming to add at least 350
new animals in 5 years and 1,000 in 10 years, significantly enhancing the Center's resources for cutting-
edge research on NIH-funded HIV/AIDS.",<AIDS/HIV><Animals><Biomedical Research><Breeding><Communities><Funding><HIV/AIDS><Investigators><M mulatta><M. mulatta><Macaca mulatta><Modeling><NIAID><NIH><National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease><National Institutes of Health><Research><Research Personnel><Research Resources><Researchers><Resources><Rhesus Macaque><Rhesus Monkey><Therapeutic Intervention><United States National Institutes of Health><develop a vaccine><develop vaccines><development of a vaccine><intervention therapy><non-human primate><nonhuman primate><programs><vaccine development>,HIV/AIDS
Assessment of metformin for restoration of immune homeostasis in HIV+ and HIV- individuals with a history of injection drug use,Assessment of metformin for restoration of immune homeostasis in HIV+ and HIV- individuals with a history of injection drug use,"Project Summary
The combined opioid and stimulant use epidemic is an escalating public health emergency with numerous
biological and psychological drivers and consequences, which are amplified in people with HIV (PWH) and other
marginalized groups. We and others have described significant immune alterations in PWH and individuals that
inject opioids and/or stimulants including increased systemic inflammation and lymphocyte dysregulation,
including among B cells. This heighted inflammatory state and distorted B cell function likely contribute to
increased risk and severity of infections and inflammatory co-morbidities including cardiovascular, kidney, liver,
and autoimmune diseases. Although anti-retroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV, its ability to restore immune
homeostasis is incomplete, resulting in accelerated immunological aging and associated co-morbidities;
subsequently development of adjunctive interventions to mitigate these complications is ongoing. Active
substance use, intoxication, and related behaviors associated with injection drug use can impact HIV viral
dynamics and immune competency. Among people who inject drugs (PWID) that do not have HIV, there is a
high risk for acquiring HIV, clear indications of reduced effectiveness of HIV vaccines, and altered viral dynamics
in the acute stage of HIV infection; these unique factors highlight the challenges of HIV vaccine development for
PWID. There is an unmet need for interventions that can restore immune homeostasis in PWID in order to
improve responses to pathogens and minimize inflammatory-related co-morbidities. Metformin (MTF), the most
widely prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes (T2D), may be such an intervention. Animal and human studies have
demonstrated MTFs ability to reduce inflammation and enhance vaccine responses. Our central hypothesis is
that MTF can mitigate the inflammation and immune dysregulation that is prevalent in PWID including among
PWH, restoring immune homeostasis and responsiveness. This will be addressed through a placebo controlled,
randomized clinical trial of MTF in PWH and non-PWH with a history of recent injection drug use including opioids
and stimulants. Assessment of Hepatitis A/B and pneumococcal vaccine responses during this trial will allow
examination of adaptive responses to pathogens of concern within these populations and serve as a surrogate
for assessing their potential response to a future HIV vaccine. Vaccine outcomes will provide a metric to
complement the integrated behavioral and high-resolution functional analysis of systemic and mucosal
inflammation and immunity, providing mechanistic insights relevant to HIV prevention and pathogenesis. Our
hypothesis will be addressed through the following aims: 1) determine the ability of MTF to mitigate inflammation
and improve vaccine response in PWID, 2) determine the ability of MTF to normalize B cell phenotype and
function in PWID, and 3) determine the influence of MTF on mucosal inflammation and immunity.","<AIDS Virus><AIDS prevention><Acceleration><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired

The impact of antiretroviral therapy on fetal immune system development in SIV-exposed rhesus macaques,The impact of antiretroviral therapy on fetal immune system development in SIV-exposed rhesus macaques,"SUMMARY
 The use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnant women living with HIV is an effective way to prevent
mother-to-child transmission. However, HIV-exposed, but uninfected (HEU) children experience higher mortality
from common infections and severe respiratory disease. However, the independent and combinatorial effects of
HIV and ART on fetal immune cell development remain unknown. We propose to utilize the well-established
rhesus macaque model of ART-treated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection to test our hypothesis that
maternal SIV and ART exert differential effects on the development and maturation of the fetal immune
system, resulting in dysregulated functional responses. To address the differential effects of suppressed
SIV infection and ART, we will study three experimental groups of females. In the SIV/ART group, females will
be infected with SIV and then suppressed with ART before undergoing timed-mated breeding. We will have two
control groups: an ART-only group and an untreated/uninfected healthy pregnancy group. We acknowledge that
the ART-only group is not a clinically relevant scenario, but necessary in the context of the proposed studies to
distinguish the contribution of ART per se to the fetal immune phenotype exhibited by the offspring of SIV/ART
dams. We do not have an untreated SIV-infected group, as this is not relevant to the vast majority of pregnant
WLWH. GD130-135 fetuses will be obtained via Caesarean section and studied as outlined in the following
Specific Aims. Aim 1. Determine the effects of maternal SIV/ART or ART on fetal immune system function.
HEU children exhibit altered lymphocyte function and blunted responses of monocytes to pathogens. However,
little is known about the effects of HIV/ART and ART exposure on lymphoid and myeloid cell activation during
fetal development. Therefore, we will study the effects of SIV/ART or ART on both the innate and adaptive arms
of the fetal immune system in circulation and in fetal tissues using a combination of flow cytometry, functional
assays, and single-cell transcriptomics. Aim 2. Determine the effects of maternal SIV/ART or ART on fetal
hematopoiesis. SIV/ART or ART may impact fetal immune system development by altering fetal hematopoietic
stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Therefore, in this aim, we will isolate HSPCs from the fetal liver and fetal
bones and determine the transcriptional landscape and functional reconstitution abilities of HSPCs from
SIV/ART, ART alone, and control fetuses. Given the increasingly prevalent use of ART in women of reproductive
age, this study will further our understanding of the effect of ART on fetal immune development. The ultimate
goal of the proposed studies is to identify fetal immune system developmental pathways that can be targeted by
therapeutics and interventions to improve immune outcomes for this vulnerable population of infants.",<0-11 years old><3rd trimester><AIDS Virus><Abdominal Delivery><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Address><Age><Agonist><Airway infections><Architecture><Assay><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Birth><Blood Precursor Cell><Blood monocyte><Body Tissues><Bone Marrow><Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System><Breast Feeding><Breast fed><Breastfed><Breastfeeding><Breeding><C section><CD34><CD34 gene><Cell Body><Cells><Cesarean><Cesarean section><Child><Child Youth><Children (0-21)><Circulation><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Control Groups><Defect><Developing fetus><Development><Engineering / Architecture><Engraftment><Exhibits><Exposure to><Female><Female Groups><Fetal Development><Fetal Growth><Fetal Liver><Fetal Lung><Fetal Reduction><Fetal Tissues><Fetus><Flow Cytofluorometries><Flow Cytofluorometry><Flow Cytometry><Flow Microfluorimetry><Flow Microfluorometry><Gene Transcription><Genetic Transcription><Goals><HIV><HPCA1><Hematopoiesis><Hematopoietic Cellular Control Mechanisms><Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells><Hematopoietic stem cells><Homing><Human><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Immune><Immune Cell Activation><Immune Tolerance><Immune system><Immunes><Immunity><Immunohistochemistry><Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue><Immunohistochemistry Staining Method><Immunologic Tolerance><Impairment><Infant><Infection><Inflammation><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Intravaginal Administration><Knowledge><LAV-HTLV-III><Last Trimester><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Lymphatic cell><Lymphocyte><Lymphocyte Function><Lymphocytic><Lymphoid Cell><M mulatta><M. mulatta><Macaca mulatta><Macrophage><Marrow monocyte><Maternal-Fetal Exchange><Measures><Mice><Mice Mammals><Mitochondria><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><Mother-to-child HIV transmission><Multifetal Pregnancy Reduction><Murine><Mus><Myeloid Cell Activation><Myeloid Cells><Mφ><Nutritional status><Outcome><Partner in relationship><Parturition><Pathogenesis><Pathway interactions><Phenotype><Play><Predisposition><Pregnant Women><Primates><Primates Mammals><Property><RNA Expression><Regimen><Resolution><Respiratory Disease><Respiratory Infections><Respiratory System Disease><Respiratory System Disorder><Respiratory Tract Infections><Rhesus Macaque><Rhesus Monkey><Role><SIV><Selective Fetal Terminations><Simian Immunodeficiency Viruses><Site><Socioeconomic Factors><Stimulus><Stromal Cells><Susceptibility><Systems Development><T-Cells><T-Lymphocyte><Testing><Third Pregnancy Trimester><Third Trimester><Tissues><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Transcription><Transplacental Exposure><Treatment Protocols><Treatment Regimen><Treatment Schedule><Vaginal Administration><Vertical Disease Transmission><Viral><Viral Diseases><Viral Pathogenesis><Viral reservoir><Viremia><Virus Diseases><Virus reservoir><Virus-HIV><Vulnerable Populations><Woman><Women's Group><adverse consequence><adverse outcome><ages><antiretroviral therapy><antiretroviral treatment><arm><blood cell formation><blood cell progenitor><blood progenitor><blood stem cell><blood-forming stem cell><bone><clinical relevance><clinical translation><clinically relevant><clinically translatable><combinatorial><developmental><exhaustion><expectant mother><expecting mother><experience><experimental group><fetal><fetus tissue><flow cytophotometry><healthy pregnancy><hematopoietic progenitor><hematopoietic stem progenitor cell><hemopoietic progenitor><hemopoietic stem cell><immune activation><immune system function><immune system tolerance><immune unresponsiveness><immunological paralysis><improved><in utero><interventional strategy><intra-uterine growth><intrauterine growth><kids><lymph cell><mate><maternal-fetal interface><mitochondrial><monocyte><mortality><mother to child transmission><offspring><pathogen><pathway><pregnant><pregnant mothers><premature><prematurity><prevent><preventing><progenitor cell differentiation><progenitor differentiation><reconstitute><reconstitution><reproductive><resolutions><response><social role><socio-economic factors><stem and progenitor differentiation><stem cell differentiation><targeted drug therapy><targeted drug treatments><targeted therapeutic><targeted therapeutic agents><targeted therapy><targeted treatment><thymus derived lymphocyte><transcriptomics><vaccine efficacy><viraemia><viral infection><viral sepsis><virus infection><virus pathogenesis><virus-induced disease><virusemia><vulnerable group><vulnerable individual><vulnerable people><youngster>,HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Pregnancy; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human; Women's Health Research
Development of three KSHV vaccine platforms and chimeric MHV68-K-G for in vivo mouse infection study,Development of three KSHV vaccine platforms and chimeric MHV68-K-G for in vivo mouse infection study,"Abstract
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a prevalent virus that establishes a lifelong persistent
infection in humans and is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and primary effusion lymphomas (PELs).
Despite the reduction in complications associated with HIV infection due to combination antiretroviral
therapy, KS still occurs in individuals with well-controlled HIV infection, in older men without HIV infection
(classic KS), in sub-Saharan Africa (endemic KS), and in transplant recipients (iatrogenic KS). Despite
being a pressing human health problem, very little research has been conducted to date on potential
vaccine development against KSHV infection and its associated diseases. This is primarily due to the lack
of significant interest as well as the absence of an effective animal model that supports in vivo studies on
KSHV infection. For this reason, recombinant Murine Herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) has been used as the
murine counterpart of KSHV in a small, manageable mouse model. The goal of this U01 application is
twofold: firstly, to test three different novel vaccine platforms against KSHV infection, and secondly, to
develop chimeric MHV68 carrying the replacement of KSHV glycoprotein (MHV68-K-G) as a surrogate
challenge virus for testing the efficacy of KSHV vaccines in an in vivo mouse model.",<AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Address><Adverse effects><Affect><Africa South of the Sahara><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Antibody Response><Antigens><Area><Attention><BAC clone><BACs><Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes><Basic Research><Basic Science><Codon><Codon Nucleotides><Development><Disease><Disorder><Engineering><Epidemic Parotitis Virus><Exhibits><Generations><Genes><Genetic><Glycoproteins><Goals><HHV-8><HHV8><HIV><HIV Infections><HTLV-III Infections><HTLV-III-LAV Infections><Health><Healthcare><Herpes infection><Herpesviridae><Herpesviridae Infections><Herpesviridae disease><Herpesvirus Infections><Herpesvirus Vaccines><Herpesviruses><Human><Human Herpesvirus 8><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections><Iatrogenic Kaposi's Sarcoma><Immune response><Immunity><Immunocompromised><Immunocompromised Host><Immunocompromised Patient><Immunological response><Immunosuppressed Host><In Vitro><Individual><Infection><Infrastructure><KSHV><Kaposi Sarcoma><Kaposi Sarcoma-Associated Herpes Virus><Kaposi Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus><Kaposi sarcoma associated virus><Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus><Kaposi's Sarcoma><Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus><LAV-HTLV-III><Link><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Measles virus><Measures><Messenger RNA><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modeling><Modern Man><Mouse herpesvirus strain 68><Multiple Hemorrhagic Sarcoma><Mumps virus><Murid herpesvirus 4><Murine><Murine herpesvirus 68><Mus><Myxovirus parotitidis><Play><Population><Preventive><Process><Production><Protein Subunits><Proteins><RNA vaccine><RNA-based vaccine><Recombinants><Research><Research Resources><Resources><Role><Safety><Side><Sub-Saharan Africa><Subsaharan Africa><Subunit Vaccines><Technology><Testing><Transplant Recipients><UTRs><Untranslated Regions><Vaccinated><Vaccine Antigen><Vaccine Design><Vaccines><Variant><Variation><Viral><Viral Diseases><Viral Pathogenesis><Viral Vector><Virus><Virus Diseases><Virus Replication><Virus-HHV8><Virus-HIV><Vulnerable Populations><antiretroviral therapy><antiretroviral treatment><assess effectiveness><chronic infection><determine effectiveness><develop a vaccine><develop vaccines><development of a vaccine><developmental><effectiveness assessment><effectiveness evaluation><efficacy testing><evaluate effectiveness><examine effectiveness><experience><flexibility><flexible><health care><herpes virus><high risk><host response><immune system response><immunogen><immunogenicity><immunoresponse><immunosuppressed patient><in vivo><in vivo Model><interest><kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus><kaposi's sarcoma-associated human herpesvirus><lipid based nanoparticle><lipid nanoparticle><mRNA><mRNA lipid nano particle vaccine><mRNA vaccine><mRNA-LNP based vaccine><mRNA-LNP combination vaccines><mRNA-LNP vaccines><mRNA-based vaccine><model of animal><mouse model><murine model><nano particle><nano-sized particle><nanoparticle><nanosized particle><neutralizing antibody><new vaccines><next generation vaccines><novel><novel vaccines><older men><persistent infection><plasmid vaccine><primary effusion lymphoma><recombinant virus><rougeole virus><rubeola virus><self assembly><social role><tool><transplant patient><vaccine candidate><vaccine development><vaccine efficacy><vaccine platform><vector vaccine><vector-based vaccine><viral infection><viral multiplication><viral replication><viral testing><virus infection><virus multiplication><virus pathogenesis><virus testing><virus-induced disease><vulnerable group><vulnerable individual><vulnerable people>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Cancer; Emerging Infectious Diseases; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Nanotechnology; Orphan Drug; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Vaccine Related
Translational Geroscience Network,Translational Geroscience Network,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Fundamental aging processes appear to be root-cause contributors to most of the disorders and diseases across
the lifespan that account for the bulk of disability, mortality, and health costs. The goal of the nation-wide
Translational Geroscience Network (TGN) is to accelerate translation of geroscience-guided lifestyle, nutritional,
and drug interventions that target these aging processes from biological discovery and pre-clinical validation to
testing in humans. The TGN is motivated by the hypothesis that clinical interventions targeting fundamental
mechanisms of aging can delay, prevent, alleviate, or treat age-related diseases and disabilities as a group,
instead of one at a time (the Geroscience Hypothesis). During the next grant period, the aims of TGN are:
Aim 1) Accelerate development of a diverse portfolio of interventions targeting fundamental aging processes
(gerotherapeutic interventions) by leveraging TGN expertise and infrastructure in terms of study design, outcome
measures selection, quality control, regulatory compliance, biostatistics, data management, gerodiagnostic
assays, and biobanking for translational early phase gerotherapeutic clinical studies. The current 81 endorsed
or planned studies linked to the TGN now include lifestyle and nutritional interventions, metformin, rapalogs, anti-
inflammatories, MitoQ, senolytics, &/or NAD precursors for several indications as well as observational studies.
Aim 2) Discover, develop, select, optimize, and validate gerodiagnostic measures of aging mechanisms across
studies and optimize reference analytical capabilities of the Facilities for Geroscience
Analysis (FGA). The >150 gerodiagnostics and indicators of organ & immune dysfunction that are or will be
tested in response to interventions include analytes in blood, urine, saliva, synovial fluid, buccal swabs, CSF,
biopsies, & other samples from TGN clinical studies.
Aim 3) Provide statistical and data management support to select efficient designs, facilitate sample size
estimates, and incorporate FDA-compliant network-wide data capture, allowing cross-study comparisons.
Sensitive, specific, and reliable phenotypic signatures responsive to interventions that are based on body fluid
analytes, questionnaires, exam findings, physical & cognitive function, imaging, and biopsies will be refined and
composite scores/ signatures integrating these analytes, clinical scales, and physical function tests developed.
Aim 4) Expand TGN biobanking of samples from across studies to facilitate reverse translation, exploratory
analyses, and new ancillary research as hypotheses develop and assays become available. We will continue to
work with the NIA Biobank to ensure sample storage and distribution, even beyond the terms of this award.
Blood (plasma, serum, PBMCs), urine, buccal swabs (& as available, CSF, saliva, biopsies, aqueous humor,
synovial fluid, hair & nail clippings, microbiome), ECG, imaging, medical record (diagnoses, history, physical
signs, routine labs), and questionnaires from TGN/FGA minimally invasive & interventional studies are archived.
The TGN has enormous potential to impact public health through delaying, preventing, alleviating, and treating
multiple disorders and promoting healthspan, the period of life free of disability.","<0-11 years old><21+ years old><AIDS Virus><Acceleration><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired

"Influence of Social Media, Social Networks, and Misinformation on Vaccine Acceptance Among Black and Latinx Individuals","Influence of Social Media, Social Networks, and Misinformation on Vaccine Acceptance Among Black and Latinx Individuals","Abstract
 One of the most recent and significant public health problems deals with addressing vaccine hesitancy and
mis/disinformation. As new types of vaccines become effective and available, and bundled together, it
becomes increasingly important that researchers and health departments learn how to best communicate to
the public the correct science behind vaccines. Black/African American and Latinx populations might be
especially impacted by misinformation due to health inequity and low health literacy.
 However, despite extensive exposure to vaccine mis- and disinformation, many Blacks and Latinx are
resilient to misinformation and still choose to get vaccinated. This application takes a unique approach in
leveraging that positive outcome by identifying the predictors of Black and Latinx individuals who are frequently
exposed to misinformation, yet demonstrate broad vaccine acceptance for different vaccine types.
 Many factors play a role in vaccine acceptance/hesitancy, including social media and social networks, as
well as traditional multi-level factors such as mental health, political ideology, stigma, access to health
services, trust in the healthcare system, and educational opportunities. Our team has conducted extensive
research on the factors influencing attitudes and behaviors among Black and Latinx populations, for COVID-19
vaccine uptake, as well as ways to use digital data and tools to gain insights and intervene to improve them. In
this study, we seek to use similar artificial intelligence methods on social media, social network, and other
multi-level data to identify factors influencing vaccine acceptance among Black and Latinx populations.
 We seek to enroll 500 Black and Latinx individuals who are Twitter (X) followers of known vaccine-hesitant
influencers. We will collect baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up data on participants’ vaccine acceptance;
misinformation exposure; perceptions about vaccines, including willingness to receive future vaccines or enroll
in a vaccine clinical trial; digital contextual data (e.g., social media content; social network ties; and other multi-
level factors associated with vaccine knowledge and acceptance (e.g., political ideology, medical distrust,
structural factors). We will study the factors affecting acceptance of vaccines. We will also develop a tool to
visualize the data to inform researchers about how to add these new data/approaches to surveillance efforts.
Specifically, we seek to 1) Identify the relationship between social media data and vaccine acceptance among
Black and Latinx followers of influencers spreading vaccine-hesitant information, 2) Examine the influence of
social network factors on vaccine acceptance, and 3) Develop a visualization tool to graph and map contextual
data (e.g., social media content and geographic and network location of social network ties).",<2019-nCoV vaccine><21+ years old><AI based method><AI based model><AI model><AI system><AIDS

Comprehensive Cancer Center Support Grant,Comprehensive Cancer Center Support Grant,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common and third most fatal cancer among women worldwide. Cervical cancer
is an AIDS-defining illness and the most common cancer among women living with HIV (WLWH) globally.
Overall, WLWH have a higher risk of HPV acquisition, lower risk of HPV clearance, higher incidence of high
grade lesions (HGSIL), reduced regression from HGSIL to normal, and higher incidence of cervical cancer
compared to women without HIV. However, little is known about the biological mechanism of cervical pre-cancer.
It is estimated that there are 250,000-1 million new cases of cervical pre-cancer each year in the U.S. requiring
treatment for these pre-cancerous lesions. Even with the WHO’s 90-70-90 cervical cancer elimination strategy,
where they expect to treat 90% of the pre-cancer women, the unwanted effects of invasive treatment should not
be overlooked. Not all pre-cancers progress to cancer and identifying biomarkers associated with progression
could help with treatment algorithms (specifically in HIV). One compelling hypothesis is that additional molecular
events besides human papillomavirus (HPV) are required for cervical pre-cancer development as well as
progression to high grade lesions and biological aging is a likely event at the molecular level. Several studies
suggest that HIV induces alterations of the host biology and in doing so these alterations can accelerate
biological aging. HIV-related aging potentially results in impairing the immune system so that it can no longer
control the risk for cancer. Immune cell profiles using methylation-derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR) and
leukocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) have been shown to be associated with risk of different cancers, including
HPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer; however, there are no reports of studies in pre-cancer, which is a pre-cursor
to cancers that will have impactful prevention strategies. In the proposed study, we will examine the association
of two biomarkers of aging (aging-related inflammation and DNA methylation) with cervical pre-cancer in WLWH
and compare with HIV-negative women in two races (Black and White). To achieve the goal, we will utilize tissues
from: a) “coexisting” normal and pre-cancer lesions from each individual and b) pre-cancer progression lesion
samples collected longitudinally from the same individual from two different time-points. This design allows
validation of results using two different study designs. We will focus on the different neoplastic tissues and utilize
cell isolation techniques and nucleotide processing technologies that allow comprehensive methylation assays
to derive two biomarkers of aging, immune-cell profile (Aim 1) and biological age (Aim 2), using state-of-the-art
computational algorithms. This innovative study will bridge the gap in translating molecular knowledge of cervical
pre-cancer progression and potentially provide insights into development of aging biomarkers. There is potential
demethylation mechanism that will significantly advance management and treatment of cervical pre-cancer
lesions as well as therapeutic vaccine development, specifically in vulnerable populations (HIV status and race).",<11 year old><11 years of age><21+ years old><65 and older><65 or older><65 years of age and older><65 years of age or more><65 years of age or older><65+ years><65+ years old><> 65 years><AIDS><AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Age><Aged 65 and Over><Aging><Algorithms><Anatomic Sites><Anatomic structures><Anatomy><Archives><Assay><Automobile Driving><Bioassay><Biologic Factor><Biological><Biological Aging><Biological Assay><Biological Factors><Biological Function><Biological Markers><Biological Process><Biology><Black><Black race><Blood Neutrophil><Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil><Blood leukocyte><Blood monocyte><Body Tissues><CCSG><Cancer Biology><Cancer Cause><Cancer Causing Agents><Cancer Center Support Grant><Cancer Etiology><Cancers><Carcinogens><Cell Body><Cell Isolation><Cell Segregation><Cell Separation><Cell Separation Technology><Cells><Cervical><Cervical Cancer><Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma><Cervix Cancer><Cervix Squamous Cell Carcinoma><Cervix Uteri Squamous Cell Carcinoma><Cessation of life><Chronology><Comprehensive Cancer Center><Computational algorithm><Country><DNA Methylation><DNA Molecular Biology><Death><Deterioration><Development><Disease><Disorder><Early Diagnosis><Economic Income><Economical Income><Environment><Epidemiologist><Epigenetic><Epigenetic Change><Epigenetic Mechanism><Epigenetic Process><Epigenetic age><Epithelium><Ethnic Group><Ethnic People><Ethnic Population><Ethnic individual><Ethnicity People><Ethnicity Population><Event><Female><Formalin><General Population><General Public><Genetic predisposing factor><Goals><Gynecology><HIV><HIV Infections><HIV Seronegativities><HIV Seronegativity><HIV negative><HPV><HPV + oropharyngeal carcinoma><HPV infection><HPV mediated oropharynx cancer><HPV oropharyngeal cancer><HPV positive oropharyngeal cancer><HPV positive oropharynx cancer><HPV related oropharyngeal cancer><HPV related oropharyngeal carcinoma><HPV+ OPC><HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer><HPV-High Risk><HPV-OPC><HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer><HPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer><HPV-related OPC><HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer><HTLV-III Infections><HTLV-III Seronegativities><HTLV-III Seronegativity><HTLV-III-LAV Infections><High Risk Oncogenic HPV><High risk HPV><High risk Human Papillomavirus><High risk Human papilloma virus><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human Papilloma Virus><Human Papillomavirus><Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections><Human papilloma virus infection><Human papillomavirus driven oropharyngeal cancer><Human papillomavirus infection><Human papillomavirus related oropharyngeal carcinoma><Human papillomavirus- related oropharyngeal cancer><Human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal cancer><IARC><Immune><Immune system><Immunes><Immunosuppression><Immunosuppression Effect><Immunosuppressive Effect><Impairment><Incidence><Income><Individual><Individuals from minority><Individuals of minority><Infectious Human Wart Virus><Inflammation><International Agency for Research on Cancer><Investigators><Knowledge><LAV-HTLV-III><Lesion><Leukocytes><Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System><Low risk HPV><Low risk Human Papillomavirus><Low risk Human papilloma virus><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Lymphatic cell><Lymphocyte><Lymphocytic><Malignant Cervical Neoplasm><Malignant Cervical Tumor><Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Malignant Tumor of the Cervix><Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri><Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm><Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor><Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri><Marrow Neutrophil><Marrow leukocyte><Marrow monocyte><Mentors><Methylation><Minority Groups><Minority People><Minority Population><Minority individual><Molecular><Molecular Biology><Morbidity><Morbidity -

Earlier detection of HPV-related oropharynx cancer in people living with and without HIV,Earlier detection of HPV-related oropharynx cancer in people living with and without HIV,"Abstract
Oral HPV is the cause of increasing incidence of HPV-related oropharynx cancer (HPV-OPC) in the
United States and globally, and is expected to continue into the next century despite an effective
vaccine. The risk of HPV-OPC and HPV-related anogenital malignancies is significantly increased
among people living with HIV (PLWH). Oral and plasma HPV and E6 antibodies are associated with
increased future risk of HPV-OPC and present an opportunity for screening for HPV-OPC. We have
developed the longest running and largest cohort of healthy people living with and without HIV, with
biomarkers of HPV-OPC. This study will combine our existing unique enriched cohort of individuals
with HPV16 biomarkers with new participants identified in a screening scenario to develop a larger
cohort of individuals at-risk for HPV16-OPC (called the MOUTH2 study). We will screen for oral and
blood biomarkers with the aim to 1) study progression to HPV-OPC and how it differs in those with
and without HIV; 2) characterize impact of HIV on oral HPV16 persistence, and 3) evaluate
performance characteristics of stand-alone vs sequential biomarker screening. This prospective
observational cohort will provide the ability to examine questions necessary to understand the long-
term natural history of oral HPV in people living with and without HPV and to inform future study
design to elucidate the benefits and harms of screening.","<AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Active Follow-up><Age><Algorithms><Anal Cancer><Anal Cancers><Anogenital Human Papilloma Virus Infection><Anogenital Human papillomavirus Infection><Anogenital cancer><Antibodies><Anus Cancer><Biological Markers><Blood><Blood Plasma><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Cancers><Characteristics><Chronic><Clinical Evaluation><Clinical Testing><Clinical Trials><Complement><Complement Proteins><DNA><Deoxyribonucleic Acid><Detection><Disease><Disorder><Early Diagnosis><Future><Gender><Groups at risk><HIV><HPV><HPV + oropharyngeal carcinoma><HPV 16><HPV detection><HPV mediated oropharynx cancer><HPV oropharyngeal cancer><HPV positive oropharyngeal cancer><HPV positive oropharynx cancer><HPV related oropharyngeal cancer><HPV related oropharyngeal carcinoma><HPV screening><HPV+ OPC><HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer><HPV-16><HPV-OPC><HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer><HPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer><HPV-related OPC><HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer><HPV16><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human Papilloma Virus><Human Papilloma Virus detection><Human Papilloma Virus screening><Human Papillomavirus><Human papilloma virus type 16><Human papillomavirus 16><Human papillomavirus driven oropharyngeal cancer><Human papillomavirus related oropharyngeal carcinoma><Human papillomavirus type 16><Human papillomavirus- related oropharyngeal cancer><Human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal cancer><Immune response><Immune system><Immunochemical Immunologic><Immunologic><Immunological><Immunological response><Immunologically><Immunologics><Impairment><Incidence><Individual><Infection><Infectious Human Wart Virus><Knowledge><LAV-HTLV-III><Learning><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Malignant Anal Neoplasm><Malignant Anal Tumor><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Oropharyngeal Neoplasm><Malignant Oropharyngeal Tumor><Malignant Tumor><Malignant Tumor of the Anus><Malignant neoplasm of anus><Medical><Mental Depression><Natural History><Oral><Oropharnyx Cancers><Oropharyngeal><Oropharyngeal Cancer><Oropharyngeal Carcinoma><Oropharynx><Oropharynx Cancer><Oropharynx Carcinoma><Oropharynxs><Participant><People at risk><Performance><Persons><Persons at risk><Plasma><Plasma Serum><Population><Populations at Risk><Predictive Factor><Preventative strategy><Prevention strategy><Preventive strategy><Proteins><Research Design><Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma><Risk><Risk Estimate><Risk Factors><Role><Running><Sampling><Secondary Prevention><Secondary to><Specificity><Study Type><Suicide><Survivors><Testing><Time><Triage><United States><Vaccines><Virus-HIV><active followup><ages><anal squamous cell carcinoma><anogenital HPV><antibody based detection><antibody detection><bio-markers><biologic marker><biomarker><biomarker identification><cancer diagnosis><clinical test><co-infection><co-morbid><co-morbidity><cohort><coinfection><comorbidity><complementation><cost><depression><detect antibodies><determine efficacy><early detection><efficacy analysis><efficacy assessment><efficacy determination><efficacy evaluation><efficacy examination><evaluate efficacy><examination questions><examine efficacy><fatal attempt><fatal suicide><financial toxicity><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><host response><human papilloma virus 16><human papillomavirus mediated oropharynx cancer><human papillomavirus positive oropharyngeal cancer><human papillomavirus positive oropharyngeal carcinoma><human papillomavirus positive oropharynx carcinoma><human papillomavirus+ oropharyngeal cancer><identification of biomarkers><identification of new biomarkers><immune system response><immunoresponse><improved><intent to die><malignancy><malignant oropharynx neoplasm><malignant oropharynx tumor><marker identification><neoplasm/cancer><oral HPV><oral human papilloma virus><oral human papillomavirus><oral pharyngeal><prospective><research clinical testing><screen time><screening><screenings><seroconversion><seropositive><social role><specific biomarkers><study design><suicides><television watching><tumor><tv watching><type 16 Human papilloma virus><type 16 Human papillomavirus><wart virus>","Cancer; Clinical Research; Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Disease; Digestive Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Sexually Transmitted Infections"
Self-Assembling Spike-EBR Nanoparticles as a Vaccine Platform Technology Against SARS-CoV-2 and Future Pandemic Coronaviruses,Self-Assembling Spike-EBR Nanoparticles as a Vaccine Platform Technology Against SARS-CoV-2 and Future Pandemic Coronaviruses,"Project Summary/Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic represents the 3rd outbreak caused by zoonotic transmission of a beta-coronavirus
(beta-CoV) in the last 20 years. Hence there is an urgent need for new vaccine strategies to control the ongoing
pandemic and prevent future CoV outbreaks. mRNA vaccines have emerged as an ideal platform for the
development of rapid-response vaccines, but clinical studies have shown that neutralizing antibody titers elicited
by mRNA vaccines are ~10-fold lower than titers elicited by protein nanoparticle (NP) vaccines. This is a concern
with regards to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) that are less sensitive to vaccine-
induced antibodies. In addition, less than 25% of the world population is fully vaccinated. Thus, rapid-response
vaccine technologies are needed that elicit potent antibody responses with a single injection and/or lower doses,
to ensure lasting protection against VOCs, reduce costs, and accelerate global distribution. Moreover, prevention
of future CoV pandemics requires the development of a universal CoV vaccine that elicits cross-reactive immune
responses against a broad spectrum of CoV strains by focusing responses to conserved epitopes. The scope of
the proposed research is to design and evaluate new vaccine strategies to enhance the potency of mRNA-based
rapid-response vaccines and facilitate universal CoV vaccine development. The proposal is based on the EBR
NP technology, which modifies membrane proteins such as CoV spike (S) proteins to self-assemble into virus-
resembling NPs that bud from the cell surface. NP assembly is induced by inserting a short amino acid sequence
into the cytoplasmic tail designed to recruit proteins from the endosomal sorting complex required for transport
(ESCRT) pathway. Initial studies in mice showed that low-dose injections of EBR NPs presenting the SARS-
CoV-2 S protein elicited 10-fold higher neutralizing antibody titers than soluble S protein and protein-based NPs
that displayed the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. The EBR NP technology will be applied to
accomplish three goals: i) Design a hybrid mRNA vaccine encoding the modified SARS-CoV-2 S-EBR construct
that would be expressed at the cell surface and self-assemble into virus-resembling NPs to elicit more potent
antibody responses than the approved Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, while retaining the manufacturing properties
and T-cell activation of mRNA vaccines. ii) Engineer S-EBR NPs to package and deliver S or S-EBR mRNA
vaccines as an alternative to lipid NPs. This delivery approach would enhance mRNA vaccine potency as S
proteins presented on S-EBR NPs induce potent antibody responses, facilitate efficient intracellular delivery, and
target mRNA vaccines to tissues that are naturally infected by SARS-CoV-2 to induce local immune responses.
iii) Design and evaluate mosaic S-EBR NP-based universal CoV vaccine candidates that present full-length
membrane-associated S proteins from multiple CoV strains to elicit cross-reactive immune responses against a
broad spectrum of CoVs and protect against future outbreaks. The proposed vaccine strategies could have direct
impact on the COVID-19 global health crisis and advance our emergency preparedness for the next pandemic.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><2019-nCoV S protein><2019-nCoV

Identifying inter-kingdom microbial determinants of altered immunity in HIV exposed infants,Identifying inter-kingdom microbial determinants of altered immunity in HIV exposed infants,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Infants born to HIV-infected mothers are at high risk for HIV acquisition. Additionally, HIV-exposed yet
uninfected infants display reduced vaccine responses and increased disease susceptibility compared to
unexposed infants. The development of certain T cell subsets, both in the mucosa and systemically, is
determined by the presence of specific microbes in the gut and may be important in determining adaptive
immunity. However, the gut microbiota of HIV-exposed uninfected (iHEU) infants differs from that of HIV-
unexposed (iHU) infants, since their mothers have altered gut microbiota. The gut virome also plays a central
role in modulating both the bacterial microbiota and immune response of adults, yet the association between
the infant enteric virome and cellular responses to vaccination has not yet been explored. This study proposes
that the enteric virome is one of the factors influencing the morbidity of HIV-exposed infants, either by directly
altering mucosal immunity or by altering the composition of enteric bacterial communities, as a consequence of
bacteriophage or other viral dynamics. This proposal will utilize an already funded, ongoing cohort to
longitudinally identify interactions between viruses, bacterial microbiota, and cellular responses to vaccination
in 40 iHEU and 40 iHU (Aim 1). Viral metagenome data will be integrated with bacterial community datasets
and T cell cytokine responses to BCG vaccination to identify viral and bacterial taxa correlated with BCG
responses. The effect of the expanded virome on bacterial microbiota and responses to BCG vaccination will
then be assessed for causality in gnotobiotic mouse models (Aim 2). The effect of the expanded iHEU viroem
on mucosa and peripheral gene expression will be assayed using single cell RNA sequencing in Aim 3.
Integrative analyses will be used to identify interactions between specific bacterial and viral taxa, as well as
their associated with BCG responses. Together, these Aims will identify mechanisms of gut dysbiosis in iHEU
and reveal potential therapeutics to restore health to this group. Collectively, this proposal will reveal how
maternal HIV infection shapes the enteric microbiome and immunity of associated infants.",<16S gene sequencing><16S rRNA amplicon sequencing><16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing><16S rRNA gene sequencing><16S rRNA genomic profiling><16S rRNA sequencing><16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing><16S ribosomal RNA sequencing><16S sequencing><21+ years old><AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Adult><Adult Human><Animals><Assay><BCG Live><BCG Vaccine><BCG immunization><BCG vaccination><BCG-vaccinated><Bacille Calmette Guerin vaccine><Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccinated><Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination><Bacille Calmette-Guérin><Bacillus Calmette Guerin Vaccine><Bacillus Calmette Guérin><Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination><Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination><Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine><Bacteria><Bacterial Vaccines><Bacterin><Bacteriophages><Bayesian Analysis><Bayesian computation><Bayesian inference><Bayesian network analysis><Bayesian spatial analysis><Bayesian statistical analysis><Bayesian statistical inference><Bayesian statistics><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Causality><Cell Body><Cells><Colon><Communities><Data><Data Set><Development><Diathesis><Disease><Disease susceptibility><Disorder><Enteral><Enteric><Etiology><Feces><Functional Metagenomics><Funding><GI microbiome><GI microbiota><Gastrointestinal microbiota><Gene Expression><Germ-Free><Gnotobiotic><Gnotobiotics><HIV><HIV Infections><HTLV-III Infections><HTLV-III-LAV Infections><Health><Human><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human Microbiome><Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections><Immune><Immune response><Immunes><Immunity><Immunization><Immunize><Immunological response><Infant><Intestinal><Intestines><LAV-HTLV-III><Life><Linear Regressions><Link><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Mediating><Metagenomics><Microbe><Modeling><Modern Man><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Mothers><Mucosa><Mucosal Immunity><Mucosal Tissue><Mucous Membrane><Neonatal><Peripheral><Phages><Play><Probiotics><Research><Role><Shapes><Shotguns><Spleen><Spleen Reticuloendothelial System><Statistical Data Analyses><Statistical Data Analysis><Statistical Data Interpretation><T cell response><T-Cell Subsets><T-Cells><T-Lymphocyte><T-Lymphocyte Subsets><Techniques><Testing><Therapeutic><Vaccination><Viral><Virion><Virus><Virus Particle><Virus-HIV><Whole Blood><Work><adaptive immunity><adulthood><antagonism><antagonist><bacteria in the gut><bacterial community><bacterial microbiome><bacterial virus><bacteriome><bowel><causation><cohort><cytokine><data integration><developmental><digestive tract microbiome><disease causation><enteric microbial community><enteric microbiome><enteric microbiota><experiment><experimental group><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><gastrointestinal microbial flora><gastrointestinal microbiome><gut bacteria><gut commensal><gut community><gut dysbiosis><gut flora><gut microbe community><gut microbial community><gut microbial composition><gut microbial consortia><gut microbiome><gut microbiota><gut microbiotic><gut microflora><gut-associated microbiome><high risk><host response><human-associated microbiome><immune system response><immunoresponse><insight><intestinal biome><intestinal flora><intestinal microbiome><intestinal microbiota><intestinal microflora><intestinal tract microflora><liability to disease><metagenome><microbial><microbial consortia><microbial flora><microbiome><microbiota><microflora><mouse model><multiomics><multiple omics><multispecies consortia><murine model><panomics><pup><response><scRNA-seq><shot gun><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single-cell RNA sequencing><social role><statistical analysis><stool><thymus derived lymphocyte><vaccine response><vaccine responsiveness><vaccine-induced response><viral microbiome><virome>,Genetics; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Microbiome; Pediatric; Pediatric - AIDS; Prevention; Vaccine Related
"A Novel, Multi-compartment Intravaginal Ring for Prevention of Genital Herpes and Unintended Pregnancy","A Novel, Multi-compartment Intravaginal Ring for Prevention of Genital Herpes and Unintended Pregnancy","ABSTRACT
Genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections
worldwide. The infection is lifelong: there currently is no cure and no vaccine. In addition, HSV-1 and -2,
human papillomavirus (HPV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are responsible for intersecting
epidemics, where the disease caused by one virus facilitates the transmission and/or pathogenesis of the
other. Numerous studies suggest that user-controlled multipurpose products providing HSV prevention –ideally
along with HPV and HIV– in combination with contraception would strongly motivate higher uptake relative to
single-purpose products: women not self-identifying as at risk of HSV infection would use a multipurpose
product to avoid pregnancy, resulting in significantly improved user compliance, and hence effectiveness,
relative to single-purpose antiviral products. Many women would prefer a topical (vaginal) nonhormonal
contraception method that, unlike vaginal gels, does not require use immediately before or after sex. Our
application integrates key innovations in developing a next generation multipurpose technology (MPT)
intravaginal ring (IVR) comprised of: (1) antiviral peptide lead candidate with activity against HSV, HPV, and
HIV; (2) small-molecule inhibitors of sperm functions required to reach and fertilize the oocyte; and (3) a novel
IVR platform for long-acting, controlled delivery of the two-drug combination. We have designed and
synthesized a library of small antiviral peptides that disrupt a range of viruses, including HSV, HPV, and HIV, at
low µM concentrations. An existing lead candidate, optimized for vaginal delivery, has been selected for IVR
formulation under the current application. In parallel, we have designed and synthesized a library of highly
potent, small-molecule inhibitors of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) that effectively block sperm motility and
prevent in vitro fertilization at sub nM concentrations. Finally, our team developed an innovative IVR platform
for the delivery of drug combinations, including small molecules and biomolecules, at independently controlled
rates. In Aim 1, we will evaluate our panel of sAC inhibitor late-lead candidates using biochemical, functional,
and pharmacological assays to select a lead candidate designed specifically for vaginal dosing. In Aim 2, we
will formulate and evaluate in vitro human-sized MPT IVRs to deliver our lead antiviral peptide and lead
contraceptive combinations at target in vitro rates. In Aim 3, we will assess the pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics (safety and anti-HSV efficacy) of MPT IVR candidates in mice (efficacy and preliminary
safety) and sheep (pharmacokinetics and safety). This project builds on an established collaboration of
investigators and will advance our scientific knowledge on vaginal delivery of novel agents in the context of
HSV prevention and nonhormonal contraception.","<3,5 cyclic AMP synthetase><AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Adenyl Cyclase><Adenylate Cyclase><Adenylyl Cyclase><Adherence><Adopted><Affinity><Age><Anti-viral Agents><Anti-viral Therapy><Assay><Bioassay><Biochemical><Biological Assay><Biology><Characteristics><Chemicals><Chemistry><Clinical><Clinical Trials><Coitus><Collaborations><Contraception><Contraceptive Agents><Contraceptive methods><Contraceptives><Coupled><Coupling><Data><Development><Disease><Disorder><Dose><Drug Combinations><Drug Delivery><Drug Delivery Systems><Drug Interactions><Drug Kinetics><Drugs><Effectiveness><Endocrine Gland Secretion><Ensure><Enzyme Gene><Enzymes><Epidemic><Evaluation><Excipients><Fertility Control><Fertilization in Vitro><Fertilized Egg><Fertilized Ovum><Formulation><Genital Herpes Simplex><Genital Organs><Genitalia><Goals><HHV-2><HHV2><HIV><HPV><HSV><HSV-1><HSV-2><HSV1><HSV2><Health Benefit><Herpes Genitalis><Herpes Simplex><Herpes Simplex Infections><Herpes Simplex Type 1><Herpes Simplex Virus><Herpes Simplex Virus 1><Herpes Simplex Virus 2><Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1><Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2><Herpes labialis Virus><Herpes simplex disease><Herpesvirus 1><Herpesvirus 2 (alpha), Human><Herpesvirus hominis disease><Herpesvirus progenitalis><High Risk Woman><Hormones><Human><Human (alpha) herpes virus 2><Human Herpesvirus 2><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human Papilloma Virus><Human Papillomavirus><Human herpes simplex virus type 2><Hybrids><In Vitro><Individual><Infection><Infectious Human Wart Virus><Inhibition of Fertilization><Investigators><Knowledge><LAV-HTLV-III><Lead><Lesion><Libraries><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Medication><Membrane><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modality><Modern Man><Murine><Mus><Oocytes><Oral><Ovine><Ovis><Ovocytes><PK/PD><Pathogenesis><Pb element><Peptides><Periodicals><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Pharmacokinetics><Pharmacology><PrEP><Pre-Clinical Model><Preclinical Models><Prevention><Prevention therapy><Process><Property><Public Health><Regimen><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Risk><Safety><Sexual Intercourse><Sexually Transmitted Diseases><Sexually Transmitted Disorder><Sexually Transmitted Infection><Sheep><Simplexvirus><Sperm><Sperm Motility><Spermatozoa><Technology><Test-Tube Fertilization><Testing><Therapeutic Hormone><Topical Drug Administration><Topical application><Translations><Transmission><Ulcer><Ulceration><Unplanned pregnancy><User Compliance><Vaccines><Vagina><Vaginal Gel><Vaginal Jellies><Vaginal Ring><Vaginal birth><Vaginal delivery><Vaginal delivery procedure><Venereal Diseases><Venereal Disorders><Venereal Infections><Viral><Virus><Virus-Genital Herpes><Virus-HIV><Woman><administer topically><ages><anti-viral compound><anti-viral drugs><anti-viral medication><anti-viral therapeutic><anti-virals><apply topically><at-risk females><at-risk women><avoid pregnancy><contraceptive target><deliver topically><design><designing><developmental><drug release kinetics><drug release rate><drug/agent><experience><female genital tract><female reproductive tract><females at high risk><genital herpes><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><herpes genitalia><herpes simplex i><herpes simplex ii><herpes simplex virus 1 infection><herpes simplex virus infection><herpes simplex-1><high risk females><human alphaherpesvirus 2><improved><in vivo><inhibitor><innovate><innovation><innovative><interest><intravaginal ring><lead candidate><male fertility><membrane structure><meter><microbe pathogen><microbial pathogen><next generation><novel><pathogenic microbe><periodic><periodical><pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics><pharmacologic><pre-clinical><pre-exposure prophylaxis><preclinical><prevent><preventing><prototype><reproductive><residence><residential building><residential site><scale up><sex><sexually acquired infection><site targeted delivery><small molecular inhibitor><small molecule><small molecule inhibitor><sperm cell><sperm function><sperm mobility><success><targeted delivery><topical administration><topical delivery><topical drug application><topical treatment><topically administered><topically applied><topically delivered><topically treated><translation><transmission process><treat topically><unintended pregnancy><uptake><vaginal fluid><venereal herpes><viral infectious disease treatment><viral transmission><virus transmission><wart virus><women at high risk><women's genital tract><women's reproductive tract><zoosperm><zygote>",Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Contraception/Reproduction; HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Sexually Transmitted Infections; Topical Microbicides; Women's Health Research
Leveraging HIV infrastructure to implement cervical cancer prevention: A study to integrate HPV vaccination in adolescent HIV clinics in Zambia,Leveraging HIV infrastructure to implement cervical cancer prevention: A study to integrate HPV vaccination in adolescent HIV clinics in Zambia,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is a WHO-endorsed, evidence-based tool that can prevent up to
90% of cervical cancer cases by preventing HPV infection when administered prior to exposure to HPV and it
is recommended for girls ages 9-14. However, HPV vaccine coverage is low in low- and middle- income
countries (LMICS) where risk of dying from cervical cancer is high, especially in Zambia (site of parent grant;
UO1CA275033). REACH aims to increase access to and uptake of the vaccine using implementation science
methods. However, implementation science is a field developed in the U.S. and only recently has started to
recognize the importance of explicitly recognizing equity in the implementation process. Transposing
approaches from high income countries risks failure when misunderstanding contexts, relying on leadership
and expertise from HICs, and maintaining colonization practices This supplement project, responding to the
call for Administrative Supplements for NCI Global Oncology Mentored Research (NOT-CA-24-028), is a
methods study aiming to explicitly investigate how equity and decolonization practices can be embedded in
capacity building practices and implementation process. This is a methods-focused study aiming to strengthen
Dr. Asante's knowledge and skills on implementation science with a focus on team collaboration. To achieve
these goals, we will adapt an evidence-based matrix mentoring model for global collaboration, including self,
senior, scientific, staff mentors and sponsors. We conceptualize equity as a process aimed at reducing
disparities and its root causes, including social, structural, and political determinants. Centering equity in
implementation entails building trusting relationships, dismantling power structures, and investing in strategies
that advance equity. We will use methods of reflexivity based on Alexander et al's. model to enhance personal
and team awareness of their own positionality. The model proposes that three reflexivity practices (reflexivity
in, on, and underlying action) are tied to five actions from the Ottawa Charter: a) building healthy public policy,
(b) creating supportive environments, (c) strengthening community actions, (d) developing personal skills, and
(e) reorienting health services. Based on this model, Dr. Asante will: (1) Center equity in the REACH team
using Alexanders' three types of reflexivity, and (2) Center equity in the development of the
implementation strategies. The project will produce a needed outline of methods for the field of
implementation science on how to explicitly outline reflexivity and center equity during the implementation
mapping process. This supplement will also strengthen Dr. Asante's skills in global research leadership as an
implementation scientist, supporting her to reach her mid-term goal to MPI an R01 in implementing color
cancer screening in Zambia, further enabling her to reach her long-term goal of launching her own independent
research in CRC prevention.",<AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Address><Administrative Supplement><Adolescent HIV><Age><Award><Awareness><CRC prevention><Cervical Cancer><Cervix Cancer><Clinic><Collaborations><Color><Colorectal Cancer><Community Actions><Country><Decrease disparity><Development><Economic Income><Economical Income><Equitable healthcare><Equity><Exposure to><Failure><Goals><HIV><HIV infection in adolescence><HIV infections in adolescents><HIV-infected (HIV+) adolescents><HIV-infected adolescents><HPV><HPV Vaccination><HPV Vaccine><HPV infection><Health Services><Healthcare equity><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human Papilloma Virus><Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination><Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine><Human Papillomavirus><Human Papillomavirus Vaccination><Human papilloma virus infection><Human papillomavirus Vaccine><Human papillomavirus infection><Income><Infectious Human Wart Virus><Infrastructure><Intervention Studies><Investments><Knowledge><LAV-HTLV-III><LMIC><Lead><Leadership><Lower disparity><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Malignant Cervical Neoplasm><Malignant Cervical Tumor><Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix><Malignant Tumor of the Cervix><Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri><Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm><Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor><Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri><Maps><Medical><Mentors><Methodology><Methods><Modeling><Northern Rhodesia><Oncology><Oncology Cancer><Outcome><Pb element><Politics><Process><Public Policy><Publishing><Recommendation><Research><Risk><Science><Scientist><Screening for cancer><Site><Structure><Trust><Uterine Cervix Cancer><Virus-HIV><Zambia><accept vaccination><accept vaccine><adolescents living with HIV><adolescents with HIV><ages><career><cervical cancer prevention><colorectal cancer prevention><developmental><disparity reduction><early cancer detection><enthusiastic atmosphere><enthusiastic environment><evidence base><girls><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><implementation process><implementation science><implementation strategy><incomes><intervention research><interventional research><interventional study><interventions research><low and middle-income countries><meeting><meetings><mitigate disparity><parent grant><prevent><prevent colorectal cancer><preventing><reduce disparity><reduction in disparity><screening cancer patients><skills><social><strategies for implementation><supportive atmosphere><supportive environment><tool><vaccination acceptability><vaccination acceptance><vaccination confidence><vaccination uptake><vaccination willingness><vaccine acceptability><vaccine acceptance><vaccine confidence><vaccine uptake><vaccine willingness><wart virus>,Behavioral and Social Science; Cancer; Cervical Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Colorectal Cancer; Digestive Diseases; Dissemination and Implementation Research; HIV/AIDS; HPV and/or Cervical Cancer Vaccines; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Pediatric; Pediatric - AIDS; Prevention; Sexually Transmitted Infections; Social Determinants of Health; Vaccine Related; Women's Health Research
The effectiveness of screening women with lower genital tract neoplasia or cancers for anal cancer precursors,The effectiveness of screening women with lower genital tract neoplasia or cancers for anal cancer precursors,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We recently reported that SCCA incidence (particularly advanced-stage disease) and mortality rates are
increasing rapidly (>3% per year) in the US with notable (>5%/year) increases in women 50 years and older
showing that SCCA is one of the fastest accelerating causes of cancer incidence and mortality among all
cancer sites. Women with lower genital tract (cervical/vaginal/vulvar) dysplasia or cancer (WLGTN) represent a
large population (>200,000 new cases per year) at elevated risk of developing SCCA. We and others have
shown that the incidence of SCCA among WLGTN aged 50 years and older is over 20 per 100,000 persons,
which is both comparable to the incidence rate among women with HIV (who are the focus of current screening
efforts) and is similar to the cervical cancer incidence prior to widespread screening. Furthermore, HPV
vaccination is unlikely to decrease SCCA incidence in this population both because WLGTN have already
been exposed to oncogenic HPV, and vaccine rates remain low among US women. This highlights an urgent
need for studies evaluating possible targeted prevention in the form of anal cancer screening. Our goal is to
evaluate the benefits and harms of SCCA screening among WLGTN. Screening for SCCA involves the
identification of precancerous anal lesions (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or ""aHSILs"") using
cytologic testing or HPV testing (potentially performed by patients themselves). These lesions (if histologically
confirmed) can then be treated, thereby preventing carcinoma development, similar to practices widely
endorsed for cervical cancer. To inform guidelines, data regarding screening characteristics, natural history,
patient acceptability, the benefits and harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening for SCCA among WLGTN,
are urgently needed. We therefore propose a two-site, two-year longitudinal study of 350 HIV uninfected
WGLTN aged ≥45 years. The results of this longitudinal study will be used to synthesize a mathematical
(simulation) model that will estimate clinical and population-level benefits versus harms and cost-effectiveness
associated with different screening approaches. The Specific Aims are: (1A) To evaluate the respective
screening test characteristics of anal cytology, clinician-collected and self-collected high-risk HPV (hrHPV)
testing, and cytology/hrHPV cotesting compared to the gold standard of high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) exam
with biopsy; (1B): To determine baseline anal hrHPV and histologic aHSIL (haHSIL) prevalence and
longitudinal risk among WLGTN; (2): To compare patient acceptability and experiences for anal cancer
screening strategies among WLGTN; and (3): To develop a mathematical model determining the potential
mortality and morbidity benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of anal dysplasia screening and/or hrHPV
testing in WLGTN. In summary, the proposed multidisciplinary study will generate much-needed data regarding
the optimal SCCA screening approach for WLGTN, necessary to inform national screening recommendations
for WLGTN. This study will have direct implications for clinical cancer prevention practices.","<AIDS Virus><Acceleration><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Age Years><Anal><Anal Cancer><Anal Cancers><Anal carcinoma><Anus><Anus Cancer><Anus Carcinoma><Biological Markers><Biopsy><Cancer Cause><Cancer Etiology><Cancers><Carcinoma><Cervical><Cervical Cancer><Cervix Cancer><Characteristics><Clinical><Clinical Trials><Cytology><Data><Death Rate><Decision Analysis><Development><Disease><Disorder><Dysplasia><Effectiveness><Epidemiology><Epidermoid Carcinoma><Epidermoid Cell Cancer><Epithelial cancer><Evidence based practice guidelines><Exposure to><Generations><Goals><Guidelines><HIV><HPV><HPV Vaccination><HPV infection><HPV-High Risk><Healthcare><High Risk Oncogenic HPV><High risk HPV><High risk Human Papillomavirus><High risk Human papilloma virus><Histologic><Histologically><History><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human Papilloma Virus><Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination><Human Papillomavirus><Human Papillomavirus Vaccination><Human papilloma virus infection><Human papillomavirus infection><Incidence><Infectious Human Wart Virus><LAV-HTLV-III><Lesion><Long-term prospective studies><Longitudinal Studies><Longterm prospective studies><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Malignant Anal Neoplasm><Malignant Anal Tumor><Malignant Cervical Neoplasm><Malignant Cervical Tumor><Malignant Epidermoid Cell Neoplasm><Malignant Epidermoid Cell Tumor><Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms><Malignant Epithelial Tumors><Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Squamous Cell Neoplasm><Malignant Squamous Cell Tumor><Malignant Tumor><Malignant Tumor of the Anus><Malignant Tumor of the Cervix><Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri><Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm><Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor><Malignant Vulva Tumor><Malignant Vulvar Neoplasm><Malignant Vulvar Tumor><Malignant neoplasm of anus><Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri><Malignant neoplasm of vulva><Math><Math Models><Mathematics><Methods><Modality><Modeling><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Natural History><Neoplasms><Oncogenic><Patients><Performance><Persons><Planocellular Carcinoma><Population><Prevalence><Preventative measure><Prevention><Prevention Guidelines><Preventive measure><Provider><Publishing><Recommendation><Recording of previous events><Registries><Reporting><Research Resources><Resolution><Resources><Risk><Screening for cancer><Sensitivity and Specificity><Site><Squamous Carcinoma><Squamous Cell Cancers><Squamous Cell Epithelioma><Squamous Cell Intraepithelial Neoplasia><Squamous cell carcinoma><Squamous intraepithelial lesion><Testing><Uterine Cervix Cancer><Vaccines><Vagina><Virus-HIV><Vulva><Vulva Cancer><Vulvar Cancer><Woman><age group><aged><anal squamous cell carcinoma><bio-markers><biologic marker><biomarker><cancer location><cancer prevention><cancer site><comparative><cost><cost effective><cost effectiveness><developmental><disease natural history><dyscrasia><early cancer detection><epidemiologic><epidemiological><epithelial carcinoma><evidence based guidelines><evidence based recommendations><experience><genital tract><health care><high risk group><high risk individual><high risk people><high risk population><high standard><histories><improved><long-term study><longitudinal outcome studies><longitudinal, prospective study><longterm study><malignancy><mathematic model><mathematical model><mathematical modeling><mortality><mortality rate><mortality ratio><multidisciplinary><neoplasia><neoplasm/cancer><neoplastic growth><patient barriers><patient-level barriers><precancer><precancerous><premalignant><prevent><preventing><prevention practice><recommended screening><reproductive tract><resolutions><screening><screening cancer patients><screening guidelines><screening recommendations><screenings><simulation><vulval cancer><vulvar><wart virus>",Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Digestive Diseases; Health Services; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Sexually Transmitted Infections; Women's Health Research
"Influence of maternal virome and HIV status on infant gut virome, growth and immunity","Influence of maternal virome and HIV status on infant gut virome, growth and immunity","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The early life microbiome plays a significant role in health and disease, including immune development and
maturation. Maternal microbiota is a major determinant of infant microbiota. Studies investigating maternal-
infant microbiota transmission and its consequent influence on infant immunity have focused on the bacterial
component. Yet the impact of maternal virome on infant virome is largely unknown, and studies of the virome
in early life are limited. Infants born to mothers living with HIV are more vulnerable to diseases, have stunted
growth, and have altered immunity, including immune activation, even when they are not infected with HIV
themselves. Much work has gone into understanding the reasons for this phenomenon. Given that the enteric
virome is expanded in HIV infection, it is not surprising that our preliminary data show that infants born to HIV-
infected mothers inherit a wider range of viruses than unexposed infants. Thus, similarly to the bacterial
microbiome, the gut virome could also play an important role in modulating immune responsiveness and
growth of infants. We hypothesize that the infant enteric virome is vertically transferred, and the expanded
enteric virome of infants born to mothers who are HIV-infected leads to accelerated immune ontogeny and
activation, which influences the morbidity of infants exposed to HIV. We propose to:
1: Determine the influence of maternal virome on the infant enteric virome and compare the virome succession
in infants exposed and unexposed to HIV through the first 9 months of life. The viromes of matched mother-
infant pairs will be determined via metagenomic sequencing of nucleic acid isolated from purified viral particles.
Maternal fecal and vaginal virome composition will be correlated with that of the infants’ gut in the first week
postpartum. The composition of the enteric virome will be compared between infants exposed and unexposed
to HIV during the first week, 4, 15 and 36 weeks of life.
2: Evaluate the relationship between the virome and the bacterial microbiota in infant stool. We will assess the
relationship between bacteriophage and their bacterial targets longitudinally.
3: Evaluate the relationship between the infant enteric virome and intestinal inflammation, immune ontogeny
and linear growth. To test the hypothesis that the expanded enteric virome in uninfected infants exposed to
HIV contributes to greater immune diversity in early life, we will longitudinally assess circulating NK and T cell
ontogeny using CyTOF analysis over the first 9 months of life. To test whether the virome causes altered
immune ontogeny, we will feed infant mice with phages with and without their bacterial hosts and evaluate the
effect on immunity.

Rwanda CASCADE Clinical Trials Site for cervical cancer prevention,Rwanda CASCADE Clinical Trials Site for cervical cancer prevention,"ABSTRACT
Cervical cancer is a highly preventable malignancy caused by high-risk human papillomavirus
(hrHPV) but is not fully prevented, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).
Women living with HIV (WWH) have higher rates of hrHPV infection and 6-fold higher rates of
invasive cervical cancer. Sub-Saharan Africa carries the highest burden of cervical cancer
globally, as well as the highest global burden of HIV. The Einstein/Rwanda Research and
Capacity Building Program (ER-RCBP) has been conducting research in cervical cancer
prevention for Rwandan WWH since 2005, conducting community- and clinic-based research in
screening uptake, screening modalities, assessing HPV vaccine effectiveness, evaluating how
to implement innovative screening approaches, and developing pathology and molecular
laboratory capacity. We have enrolled nearly 10,000 women WWH and 3,000 HIV-negative
women in studies of cervical HPV infection and disease. ER-RCBP’s primary partner in this
application, and in prior research in HIV services and cervical cancer prevention, is the Rwanda
Biomedical Center (RBC), the implementation arm of Rwanda’s Ministry of Health for healthcare
delivery and research. Rwanda has an extremely effective HIV healthcare program, an equally
effective program for HPV vaccination of girls, and has recently launched a cervical cancer
screening and prevention program with primary HPV testing followed by visual inspection of the
cervix and immediate treatment with thermal ablation, if indicated, for screen-positive women.
Rwanda is thus an ideal location for testing strategies for effective cervical cancer screening in a
low-income country with a high burden of HIV, cervical cancer, and a large unscreened
population. We propose here a clinical trials site in Rwanda as part of the CASCADE Clinical
Trials Network for Cervical Cancer Prevention. Lessons learned in Rwanda can be generalized
to many low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa.",<12 year old><12 years of age><15 year old><15 years of age><AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency

Oral HPV Research Among Latin Americans Living with HIV (ORAL - H² Study),Oral HPV Research Among Latin Americans Living with HIV (ORAL - H² Study),"ABSTRACT
Oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is predominantly caused by HPV 16 and other oncogenic HPV types and
disproportionately impacts men and people living with HIV (PLWH). There is no reliable method to detect OPC
pre-cancerous lesions for secondary prevention. Trials assessing efficacy of the 9vHPV vaccine to prevent OPC
are ongoing by our team: NCI-funded U54 grant, Research on Oral and Cervical Cancer, HPV and HIV in the
Americas [ROCCHHA] Trial 201 among men with HIV, and the Merck v503-049 trial among HIV-uninfected
men. While HPV vaccination is a promising approach for the primary prevention of OPC, vaccination may not be
available to those in greatest need as most countries exclude males in their national programs and may not have
policies for PLWH vaccination. Additional methods to prevent OPC and identify PLWH at highest risk for
surveillance are urgently needed, particularly given that OPC incidence rates are significantly increasing in the
US and Latin America. To inform prevention strategies, the identification of modifiable risk factors and easily
measured biomarkers identifying those at highest risk is needed. Development of HPV-related OPC is multi-
factorial. Sexual behavior leading to an oral oncogenic HPV infection is a necessary step. Regardless of
anatomic site of infection, only a proportion of infections persist and progress to cancer. Multiple interplaying
factors influence viral persistence. We are among the few groups that have conducted large oral HPV natural
history studies contributing to this literature. Results from ours and other studies indicate that older age, poor
oral health, immune dysregulation, such as occurs among PLWH, and aberrant DNA methylation influence oral
HPV persistence. Exacerbating this is the fact that PLWH are living to older ages which results in lifelong immune
dysfunction that may accelerate biological aging, increase risk of acquiring or reactivating a multitude of
infections such as EBV, and ultimately lead to reduced oncogenic viral control. Social factors compound this
scenario as PLWH have lower utilization of dental care and other services resulting in prolonged untreated oral
infections, subsequent chronic oral inflammation, periodontal disease, and tooth loss, factors that potentially
promote oral HPV carcinogenesis, and have independently been associated with HPV-OPC risk. We are
conducting two large studies as part of our ROCCHHA grant among PLWH that obtain clinical data and oral
gargle specimens at bi-annual study visits, which we will leverage to study oral HPV natural history. The goal of
this application is to define the natural history of oncogenic oral HPV infection among PLWH. The central
hypothesis of the Oral HPV Research Among Latin Americans Living with HIV (ORAL H2) Study is that
among PLWH advanced biological age, dental health, and viral factors are associated with persistent oral
oncogenic HPV. We will estimate oral HPV 16 and oncogenic HPV infection, assess factors associated with viral
persistence, and determine the optimal combination of biomarkers and behavioral factors that predict oral
oncogenic HPV persistence.",<65 and older><65 or older><65 years of age and older><65 years of age or more><65 years of age or older><65+ years><65+ years old><> 65 years><AIDS Virus><Aberrant DNA

HIV and Women's Health,HIV and Women's Health,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The program will strengthen patient-oriented HIV clinical investigation training of physician-scientists and
other exceptional clinicians in Mwanza, in northwestern Tanzania. The program builds upon two decades of
collaboration and capacity building by the partner institutions. The primary research institution in Tanzania will
be the Mwanza Intervention Trials Unit (MITU), which is a unit of Tanzania's National Institute for Medical
Research (NIMR). MITU was established in 2006 as a collaboration between NIMR and the London School
of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) to strengthen HIV interventional research in Tanzania. MITU
collaborates closely with the Weill Bugando School of Medicine, which is also located in Mwanza. Weill
Bugando was established in 2003 to train physicians for northwestern Tanzania. MITU and Weill Bugando
have collaborated with Weill Cornell Medical College since their founding.
This research training program aims to fill a critical gap in Mwanza: the need for Tanzanian physicians with
rigorous training in patient-oriented HIV clinical investigation. We use the NIH definition of clinical
investigation as research which directly interacts with individual patients or clusters of patients in Phase I, II, or
III clinical trials, pragmatic trials, or formative epidemiologic or behavioral research in preparation for clinical
trials. The goals of the proposed training program are: 1.To increase the number of clinical investigators at
MITU and thereby increase institutional capacity for HIV clinical investigation 2. Establish Weill Bugando/MITU
as a sustainable training center for HIV clinical investigation. The ultimate goal is to prevent new HIV
infections, provide effective HIV care, and improve HIV outcomes in Tanzania and East Africa.
We will provide long-term training to fifteen outstanding clinician scientists to conduct patient-oriented HIV
clinical investigation. We will primarily train physicians but will also train exceptional other clinicians (PharmD,
DMD). We will train 10 PhDs, and 5 MS degree candidates. Tanzanian trainees will benefit from participation
in 17 active research projects in five synergistic areas of HIV investigation including HIV prevention and
vaccine research, implementation of HIV testing and treatment, women's health, HIV related co-infections, and
HIV and cardiovascular disease. We will also strengthen the PhD program in clinical investigation at Weill
Bugando by introducing 4 new graduate courses in clinical investigation. Weill Cornell is committing
institutional funds so that 4 of the best PhD graduates can have 2-year post-doctoral appointments as
MITU research scientists after their Fogarty training. At the end of the 5-year training program, MITU will have
a cadre of clinical investigators and a greater depth and breadth of externally funded HIV patient-oriented
research. MITU/Weill Bugando will be a training hub for HIV clinical investigators in East Africa.",<AIDS Virus><AIDS prevention><AIDS test><AIDS/HIV test><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Africa><Appointment><Area><Behavioral Research><Cardiovascular Diseases><Caring><Clinical Investigator><Clinical Trials><Collaborations><Disease><Disorder><Doctor of Pharmacy><Doctor of Philosophy><Epidemiologic Research><Epidemiologic Studies><Epidemiological Studies><Epidemiology Research><Female Health><Funding><Goals><HIV><HIV Infections><HIV Prevention><HIV test><HIV-1 test><HIV-2 test><HIV/AIDS prevention><HTLV-III Infections><HTLV-III-LAV Infections><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections><Human immunodeficiency virus test><Hygiene><Institution><Intervention Studies><Intervention Trial><Interventional trial><Investigation><LAV-HTLV-III><London><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Medical Research><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Outcome><Patients><Ph.D.><PhD><Pharm.D.><PharmD><Phase><Physicians><Postdoc><Postdoctoral Fellow><Preparation><Prevention Research><R-Series Research Projects><R01 Mechanism><R01 Program><Research><Research Associate><Research Grants><Research Project Grants><Research Projects><Research Training><Schools><Scientist><Tanzania><Training><Training Programs><Tropical Medicine><United States National Institutes of Health><Vaccine Research><Virus-HIV><Women's Health><cardiovascular disorder><clinical investigation><co-infection><coinfection><epidemiologic investigation><epidemiology study><improved><individual patient><institutional capacity><intervention research><interventional research><interventional study><interventions research><medical college><medical schools><patient centered><patient oriented><patient oriented research><patient oriented study><post-doc><post-doctoral><post-doctoral trainee><pragmatic effectiveness trial><pragmatic trial><preparations><prevent><preventing><programs><research associates><school of medicine><vaccine-related research>,Behavioral and Social Science; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Vaccine Related; Vaccine Related - AIDS; Women's Health Research
Developing a Two-way SMS Platform to Prevent and Treat Wasting Among HIV-infected and HIV-exposed Uninfected Children,Developing a Two-way SMS Platform to Prevent and Treat Wasting Among HIV-infected and HIV-exposed Uninfected Children,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Twenty-five percent of children with HIV-infection have childhood wasting (low weight-for-height or low mid-upper
arm circumference, and HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) children are twice as likely to be underweight as
comparable HIV-unexposed children. Wasting is known to promote morbidity, HIV-progression, and mortality
among these children. Improving wasting prevention and treatment for children and in early infant diagnosis and
HIV-care programs could not only improve the child health outcomes of these children, but also substantially
lower the global burden of childhood wasting.
This proposal will develop a novel two-way short message service (SMS) platform that targets key barriers to
improving nutritional care for HEU and HIV-infected children. This intervention will combine a maternally
administered malnutrition monitoring system (MAMMS) with infant and young child education (IYCF) delivered
by SMS. After developing the intervention using participatory design methods, we will complete a proof-of-
concept quasi-experimental trial of MAMMS-IYCF in the R21. If the R21 milestones are meet, we will use the
R33 to conduct a randomized trial testing the effectiveness of MAMMS-IYCF at reduced the incidence wasting,
and the duration of wasting treatment. During this trial we will also assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of
MAMMS-IYCF, and to better understand which barriers are being successfully addressed by intervention we will
measure its effect on key attitudinal and behavioral outcomes including trust in the healthcare system, intention
to seek if a child becomes wasted, and IYCF knowledge. This trial will generate the evidence necessary to
integrate MAMMS-IYCF interventions into existing HIV-mHealth programs across the globe, and improve the
outcomes of children in early infant diagnosis and HIV-care services while also substantially lowering the global
burden of childhood wasting.","<0-11 years old><2 year old><2 years of age><AIDS Virus><Acceleration><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Active Follow-up><Address><Age><Age Months><Attitude><Behavioral><Breast Feeding><Breast fed><Breastfed><Breastfeeding><Care Givers><Caregiver instruction><Caregivers><Caring><Cessation of life><Child><Child Care><Child Health><Child Youth><Childhood><Children (0-21)><Clinic><Complementary Feeding><Complex><Consumption><Cost Analyses><Cost Analysis><Death><Developmental Delay><Developmental Delay Disorders><Diagnosis><Diet><Early identification><Education><Educational aspects><Effectiveness><Enrollment><Exclusive Breast Feeding><Exclusive Breastfeeding><Exposure to><Failure><Family><Fe element><Feeds><Food><Frequencies><Grant><Guidelines><HIV><HIV Infections><HIV-exposed uninfected infant><HTLV-III Infections><HTLV-III-LAV Infections><Health Care Providers><Health Care Systems><Health Personnel><Health system><Healthcare><Healthcare Providers><Healthcare Systems><Healthcare worker><Height><Home><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections><Incidence><Individual><Infant><Infection><Intention><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Iron><Kenya><Knowledge><LAV-HTLV-III><Life><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Malnutrition><Measures><Medical><Methods><Monitor><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Mothers><Nutritional><Nutritional Deficiency><Nutritional Support><Opportunistic Infections><Outcome><Pathway interactions><Phase><Population><Predisposition><Prevalence><Prevention><Process><Puericulture><Qualifying><Quasi-experiment><Quasi-experimental analysis><Quasi-experimental approach><Quasi-experimental design><Quasi-experimental methods><Quasi-experimental research><Quasi-experimental study><Quasi-experimental technique><Randomization trial><Randomized><Recommendation><Recovery><Reporting><Risk><Services><Specific Child Development Disorders><Supplementary Feedings><Survey Instrument><Surveys><Susceptibility><System><Techniques><Testing><Text Messaging><Time><Trust><Undernutrition><Underweight><Upper arm><Virus-HIV><Weight><access to health care><access to healthcare><accessibility of health care><accessibility to health care><accessibility to healthcare><active followup><adverse consequence><adverse outcome><age 2 years><aged 2 years><aged two years><ages><arm><assess cost><behavior outcome><behavioral outcome><care giver education><care giver instruction><care giver training><care seeking><care services><care systems><caregiver education><caregiver training><clinical care><cost><cost assessment><cost effective intervention><cost effectiveness><cost evaluation><design><designing><dietary><dietary deficiency><diets><effectiveness testing><empowerment><enroll><evaluate cost><examine cost><exclusively breast fed><exclusively breast feeding><exclusively breastfed><exclusively breastfeeding><feeding><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><health care><health care access><health care availability><health care personnel><health care service><health care service access><health care service availability><health care worker><health provider><health workforce><healthcare access><healthcare accessibility><healthcare availability><healthcare personnel><healthcare service><healthcare service access><healthcare service availability><high risk><homes><implementation outcomes><improved><improved outcome><incremental cost><intervention delivery><interventional strategy><kids><m-Health><mHealth><mHealth therapeutic><mHealth therapy><mHealth treatment><malnourished><medical complication><medical personnel><mhealth interventions><mobile health><mobile health intervention><mobile health therapeutic><mobile health therapy><mobile health treatment><mortality><novel><nutrition deficiency><nutrition deficiency disorder><nutritional care><nutritional deficiency disorder><nutritional therapy><nutritious><pathway><pediatric><phase 3 trial><phase III trial><prevent><preventing><programs><randomisation><randomization><randomized trial><randomized, clinical trials><randomly assigned><response><short message service><social stigma><standard of care><stigma><texting><treatment provider><two year old><two years of age><vaccine response><vaccine responsiveness><vaccine-induced response><wasting><weights><youngster>",Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; HIV/AIDS; Health Services; Nutrition; Pediatric; Prevention
The Southwest National Primate Research Center Supplement- Infrastructure improvements of ABSL2 holding areas,The Southwest National Primate Research Center Supplement- Infrastructure improvements of ABSL2 holding areas,"Project Summary
There remains an acute, critical need to study HIV/AIDS as approximately 32,000 individuals are infected
annually in the U.S. and mortality globally remains at over 630,000 annually. The NIH Office of AIDS has four
main priority areas for HIV/AIDS research: reduce the incidence, develop HIV cures, develop next generation
therapies and address HIV comorbidities. The National Primate Research Centers are charged with supporting
the national needs for nonhuman primate research, with a significant priority on supporting HIV/AIDS related
research. The Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNRPC) actively supports research projects in
each of the priority areas designated by the Office of AIDS research.
There remains a current shortage of Indian origin rhesus macaques in the U.S. due to a ban on exportation and
recent global pressures significantly exacerbating the supply. This has led to the increased demand for P51
supported animals to be used to supply HIV/AIDS projects. The SNPRC has been disproportionately affected by
the national macaque shortage due to the small size of our SPF rhesus colony and the assumption of a greater
responsibility for research using rhesus. The SNPRC resources serve not only a number of internal core
scientists that are focused on infectious disease, but also a heavily external-facing research portfolio. The
SNPRC supports > 230 active research requests from > 120 affiliated scientists, with >30 % of rhesus macaque
projects completed onsite associated with HIV/AIDS related research. These requests have increased the
demand for appropriate ABSL2 research holding space in order to support the upcoming HIV/AIDS related
projects.
This proposed P51 supplement will meet an urgent need to upgrade ABSL2 macaque holding space to support
HIV/AIDS related research. Over the last decade several ABSL2 buildings and rooms have been removed from
service and taken offline at SNPRC due to failing HVAC systems. This supplement will provide HVAC upgrades
to eight ABSL2 rooms to bring them back into service to support rhesus macaque holding at SNPRC.",<AIDS><AIDS Virus><AIDS/HIV><Acquired Immune Deficiency><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Acute><Address><Administrative Supplement><Adolescent><Adolescent Youth><Affect><Animals><Area><Back><Biomedical Research><Breeding><Charge><Communicable Diseases><Communities><Dorsum><Funding><HIV><HIV vaccine><HIV/AIDS><HIV/AIDS Vaccines><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Incidence><Individual><Infectious Disease Pathway><Infectious Diseases><Infectious Disorder><Infrastructure><Institution><Investigators><LAV-HTLV-III><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><M mulatta><M. mulatta><Macaca><Macaca mulatta><Macaque><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Pathogenesis><Primates><Primates Mammals><Productivity><R-Series Research Projects><R01 Mechanism><R01 Program><Research><Research Grants><Research Personnel><Research Project Grants><Research Projects><Research Resources><Research Support><Researchers><Resources><Rhesus><Rhesus Macaque><Rhesus Monkey><Running><Sales><Scientist><Services><Site><System><United States><United States National Institutes of Health><Virus-HIV><Weaning><aged><co-infection><co-morbid><co-morbidity><coinfection><comorbidity><develop a vaccine><develop vaccines><development of a vaccine><germ free condition><human immunodeficiency virus vaccine><improved><juvenile><juvenile human><mortality><next generation><non-human primate><nonhuman primate><pandemic><pandemic disease><parent award><parent project><pathogen><pressure><programs><specific pathogen free><therapeutic agent development><therapeutic development><vaccine development>,HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases

postdoctoral research fellow at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The proposal builds on the
candidate's extensive experience in vaccine immunology and immunometabolism to understand how metabolic
reprogramming of B cells contributes to successful vaccine responses. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted
the need to develop and rapidly deploy highly immunogenic vaccines. However, insufficient immune responses
in immunocompromised individuals have emphasized that novel vaccine formulations may be required for
specific populations to overcome immunosuppression. To date, the basic immunology behind successful
vaccine responses during immunosuppression has not been well characterized. By dissecting the immunologic
and metabolic landscape following vaccination in immunosuppressed individuals, we hope to generate building
blocks to reverse engineer vaccines for specific patient populations. Preliminary data from the principal
investigator indicates that solid organ transplant recipients, who respond poorly to vaccination due to a variety
of immunosuppressive drugs, manage to successfully respond to COVID-19 vaccination by expanding atypical
B cells that are reliant on fatty acid oxidation. To further these findings, the principal investigator has proposed
a research plan consisting of 3 specific aims. Aim 1 will define populations of immunosuppressed individuals
who utilize atypical CD11c+ B cells as a salvage pathway to successful vaccine responses. Aim 2 will assess
atypical CD11c+ B cell and T cell interaction to determine specific immunological contexts that drive CD11c+ B
cell expansion. Aim 3 will target fatty acid oxidation using vaccine adjuvants to enhance atypical CD11c+ B cell
development. Together, these studies will answer how atypical B cells develop in the presence of
immunosuppression, what agents we can use to metabolically target them, and who will benefit from vaccine
strategies targeting atypical B cells. The principal investigator will also learn new techniques necessary to
accomplish the proposed research under the advisory team (Drs. Cox, Bailey, Durbin, Ji, and Pearce), all of
whom have pioneering expertise in vaccinology, immunology, immunometabolism, and biostatistics. Importantly,
her advisory committee collectively has a very strong track record of training both clinical and postdoctoral fellows
who have successfully transitioned into independent investigators at top tier research institutions. She will also
engage in and present at national seminars, take coursework on metabolic modeling, clinical vaccinology, Jr.
Faculty leadership program, grant-writing seminars, and training on running a laboratory. The outlined career
development and research plan will provide the candidate with unique cross-disciplinary skills that will enable
her transition to independence and identify promising strategies to improve vaccine responses in
immunocompromised individuals.",<AIDS Virus><Ab response><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Address><Advisory Committees><Antibody

Actions for Collaborative Community Engaged Strategies for HPV (ACCESS-HPV),Actions for Collaborative Community Engaged Strategies for HPV (ACCESS-HPV),"ABSTRACT
Cervical cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many sub-Saharan countries, including Nigeria.
Expanding human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for young girls/women, ages 9-26 years (primary
prevention) and HPV self-collection for cervical cancer screening for older women, ages 30-49 (secondary
prevention) are both critical to achieving WHO and Nigerian goals for reducing the cervical cancer burden. The
Nigerian government now recommends HPV vaccination and self-collection, yet uptake is poor. As such,
context-specific, targeted and culturally relevant implementation strategies are needed. We focus on HPV
vaccination among girls and self-collection among women because of the substantial burden of cervical
cancer. Mother-daughter relationships in Nigeria can be leveraged to increase HPV vaccination uptake among
young girls and HPV self-collection among mothers. Mothers (or similar female caregivers) profoundly
influence decisions and preferences about young girls’ vaccine uptake in the Nigerian cultural context. At the
same time, maternal choices about HPV self-collection can be reinforced in discussions with their daughters. In
the proposed study, Actions for Collaborative Community-Engaged Strategies for HPV (ACCESS-HPV), we will
use participatory crowdsourcing methods to drive HPV prevention among mother-daughter dyads.
Crowdsourcing open calls will allow us to identify locally relevant messages and dissemination techniques to
increase uptake of HPV prevention. Then, participatory learning communities will build capacity for community-
led implementation of selected strategies. Informed by social learning theory and the PEN-3 cultural model, our
multi-disciplinary research team proposes the following specific aims: (1) to develop a new combined
campaign to increase HPV vaccination for young girls (ages 9-26) and HPV self-collection for mothers (ages
30-49) using crowdsourcing open calls and participatory learning communities; (2) to determine the
effectiveness of a final combined campaign on uptake of HPV vaccination among young girls/women and HPV
self-collection among their mothers using a stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial; (3) to estimate the
impact and cost-effectiveness of the crowdsourced campaign. Our primary outcome will be vaccine uptake
(ascertained by clinic records of vaccine uptake) among young girls and HPV self-collection (ascertained by
laboratory receipt of specimens) among their mothers. The strong support of the Nigerian Institute for Medical
Research (NIMR) alongside national HPV programs creates a rich research infrastructure and increases the
likelihood of successful implementation. Our multi-disciplinary research team has experience organizing
implementation research focused on crowdsourcing and community participation in Nigeria. This study will
enhance our understanding of HPV prevention in resource-constrained settings. This grant application directly
responds to strategic priorities of the United States government, the National Institutes of Health, the National
Cancer Institute, and NOT-CA-20-025.","<AIDS Virus><AIDS prevention><Access to Care><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Address><African><Age><Applications Grants><Area><Assess implementation><Cancer Burden><Cancer Control><Cancer Control Science><Cancerous><Cancers><Care Givers><Caregivers><Cervical Cancer><Cervical Cancer Screening><Cervix Cancer><Clinic><Collection><Communities><Community Health Aides><Community Participation><Country><Daughter><Development><Dissemination and Implementation><Dose><Economic Models><Elements><Female><Goals><Government><Grant Proposals><Group Structure><HIV><HIV Prevention><HIV/AIDS prevention><HPV><HPV 6><HPV Vaccination><HPV detection><HPV screening><HPV vaccination acceptability><HPV vaccination acceptance><HPV vaccination confidence><HPV vaccination uptake><HPV vaccine acceptability><HPV vaccine acceptance><HPV vaccine confidence><HPV vaccine uptake><HPV6><Health Services Accessibility><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human Papilloma Virus><Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination><Human Papilloma Virus detection><Human Papilloma Virus screening><Human Papillomavirus><Human Papillomavirus Vaccination><Human papilloma virus 6><Human papilloma virus type 6><Human papillomavirus 6><Human papillomavirus type 6><Immunization Programs><Implementation assessment><Individual><Infectious Human Wart Virus><Interdisciplinary Research><Interdisciplinary Study><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Knowledge><LAV-HTLV-III><LMIC><Laboratories><Learning><Lesion><Low-resource area><Low-resource community><Low-resource environment><Low-resource region><Low-resource setting><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Malignant Cervical Neoplasm><Malignant Cervical Tumor><Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Malignant Tumor of the Cervix><Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri><Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm><Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor><Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri><Medical Research><Methods><Modeling><Morbidity><Morbidity -

Unmasking the roles of viral glycoproteins in oral transmission of KSHV,Unmasking the roles of viral glycoproteins in oral transmission of KSHV,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than 44,000 new cases of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) are reported globally each year, 84% of which occur in
Africa. This and other Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-induced malignancies predominate in
people with acquired or iatrogenic immunodeficiencies. Although KSHV can be detected in other human body
fluids, its frequent detection in saliva in groups both with and without risk of sexually transmitted infections (e.g.,
children) suggests that the oral cavity is the site of primary acquisition. However, the mechanism of KSHV oral
transmission in vivo, particularly the critical viral envelope glycoproteins (gps) required for viral entry,
remains unresolved. Several KSHV–host interactions have been identified, but all prior experiments were
performed in vitro and have not been validated in vivo due to prior lack of an appropriate animal model. Through
collaboration with the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, our laboratory has access to the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, CJ), a recently developed KSHV non-human primate model that is susceptible to
KSHV oral infection, and under immunosuppression acquires KS-like skin lesions. The objective of this
application is to elucidate the minimum gps required to initiate primary oral infection in vivo, as a prerequisite to
selecting key gps for developing an effective prophylactic vaccine candidate. This application builds on Dr.
Ogembo’s recently completed NCI K01 CA184388-05 research on KSHV entry mechanisms and vaccine
development. Recently, we showed that in vitro, the KSHV glycoprotein gH/gL is essential for viral infection of
epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblasts cells, but not B cells. Notably, we and others have also shown that both
monoclonal and polyclonal Abs to KSHV glycoproteins gB, gH/gL, and gpK8.1, can neutralize KSHV infection of
diverse permissive human cells in vitro. Building on this success, we generated KSHV deletion mutants lacking
the four glycoproteins thought to be critical for viral entry (gB, gH/gL, gpK8.1) and various monoclonal antibodies
specific to these gps. In this project, we will use human ex vivo samples and the CJ KSHV model to test the
hypothesis that gB and gH/gL are critical for KSHV in vivo oral transmission. The premise of our proposal is
built on strong evidence that 1) KSHV can infect CJ, which develop KS-like skin lesions, and 2) Abs against the
KSHV glycoproteins gB and gH/gL can neutralize KSHV infection in vitro and ex vivo. Furthermore, the
permissiveness to KSHV infection of human cells ex vivo and CJ makes these platforms ideal to test the KSHV
gp requirements for infection. Successful completion of the proposed study will elucidate the minimum KSHV
gps required for primary infection in ex vivo and in vivo models, advancing our long-term goal of defining the
initial steps in KSHV infection of humans and the role of antibodies in protecting against the early steps of KSHV
transmission. This will ultimately inform design and development of prophylactic vaccines that can prevent KSHV
infection and its associated cancers.",<0-11 years old><AIDS/HIV><Ab-mediated immunity><Ab-mediated protection><Africa><Age><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Antibodies><Antibody immunity><Antibody protection><Antibody-mediated protection><B blood cells><B cell><B cells><B-Cells><B-Lymphocytes><B-cell><Binding><Body Fluids><Buccal Cavity><Buccal Cavity Head and Neck><Callithrix jacchus><Callithrix jacchus jacchus><Cancers><Cavitas Oris><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cell surface><Cells><Child><Child Youth><Children (0-21)><Clinical Treatment Moab><Collaborations><Common Marmoset><Complex><Data><Detection><Development><Disease><Disorder><Endothelial Cells><Endothelium><Epithelial Cells><Epithelium><Fibroblasts><Future><Glycoproteins><Goals><HHV-8><HHV8><HIV/AIDS><Herpes infection><Herpesviridae><Herpesviridae Infections><Herpesviridae disease><Herpesvirus Infections><Herpesviruses><Human><Human Figure><Human Herpesvirus 8><Human body><Iatrogenesis><Immunity><Immunize><Immunocompetent><Immunocompromised><Immunocompromised Host><Immunocompromised Patient><Immunosuppressed Host><Immunosuppression><Immunosuppression Effect><Immunosuppressive Effect><In Vitro><Infection><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><KSHV><Kaposi Sarcoma><Kaposi Sarcoma-Associated Herpes Virus><Kaposi Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus><Kaposi sarcoma associated virus><Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus><Kaposi's Sarcoma><Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus><Laboratories><Lesion><Lymphatic cell><Lymphocyte><Lymphocytic><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Malignant lymphoid neoplasm><Maternal antibody><Measures><Membrane><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular Interaction><Monoclonal Antibodies><Mouth><Multiple Hemorrhagic Sarcoma><Oral><Oral cavity><Pattern><Persons><Predisposition><Preventative vaccine><Preventive vaccine><Primary Infection><Primates><Primates Mammals><Prophylactic vaccine><Receptor Cell><Receptor Protein><Recombinants><Reporting><Research><Risk><Role><Saliva><Sampling><Sexually Transmitted Diseases><Sexually Transmitted Disorder><Sexually Transmitted Infection><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Site><Susceptibility><T-Cells><T-Lymphocyte><Testing><Tonsil><Transmission><Transplant Recipients><Tropism><Venereal Diseases><Venereal Disorders><Venereal Infections><Viral><Viral Diseases><Viremia><Virion><Virus Diseases><Virus Particle><Virus-HHV8><Wisconsin><Work><ages><antibody-mediated immunity><biological signal transduction><cell type><design><designing><develop a vaccine><develop vaccines><development of a vaccine><developmental><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><herpes virus><human model><hypoimmunity><iatrogenic><iatrogenically><iatrogenicity><immune competent><immune deficiency><immune suppression><immune suppressive activity><immune suppressive function><immunodeficiency><immunosuppressed><immunosuppressed patient><immunosuppressive activity><immunosuppressive function><immunosuppressive response><in vivo><in vivo Model><infection mouth><kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus><kaposi's sarcoma-associated human herpesvirus><kids><latent infection><lymph cell><lymphoid cancers><lymphoid malignancy><mAbs><malignancy><membrane structure><model of animal><model of human><monoclonal Abs><mutant><neoplasm/cancer><non-human primate><nonhuman primate><novel><oral infection><oral infectious><permissiveness><polyclonal antibody><polyclonal human antibody><prevent><preventing><prophylactic><receptor><sexually acquired infection><skin lesion><social role><success><thymus derived lymphocyte><tonsillar><tool><transmission process><transplant patient><vaccine candidate><vaccine development><viraemia><viral infection><viral sepsis><virus infection><virus-induced disease><virusemia><youngster>,Biotechnology; Cancer; Clinical Research; Emerging Infectious Diseases; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Rare Diseases
Socialization Enclosures Supporting HIV/AIDS-Related Research in SPF Macaques,Socialization Enclosures Supporting HIV/AIDS-Related Research in SPF Macaques,"Project Summary – Overall
The Tulane National Primate Research Center (TNPRC) is affiliated with Tulane University of Louisiana and
was dedicated in 1964. The Center is part of Tulane University Health Sciences along with the School of
Medicine, the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, and the School of Science and Engineering. The
TNPRC is one of seven NIH-supported National Primate Research Centers within the National Primate Research
Center Program. This application requests funding for the five-year time-period of May 1, 2023-April 30, 2028.
Funds will be used to support administration, operations, animal resources, scientific research resources, a pilot
research program, alteration and renovations, outreach, and education and training activities of the Center. The
animal resources program is fully accredited by AAALAC with exemplary status. Significant infrastructure
projects have been completed including renovation of new laboratory space and completion of the PET/CT
facility within the RBL. We have completed a large infrastructure upgrade with upgraded boilers and new and
increased capacity chillers, new building automation and access controls and energy efficiency lighting
upgrades, as well as upgrades in stormwater and wastewater treatment improvements.
The period since the last renewal of the TNPRC base grant has been a time of sustained growth and
programmatic change. Total funding for the Center has increased to more than $43.8M in FY2021. The TNPRC
is the only NPRC to have a Regional Biosafety Laboratory (BSL-3), which has been a key factor in obtaining
funds to support numerous studies utilizing select agents, tuberculosis, and emerging infectious diseases,
including a new and expanding program in SARS-CoV-2 research. Our efforts in SARS-CoV-2 have provided
leadership within the NPRC system with the development of nonhuman primate models, testing therapeutics
and vaccines. In addition, we developed a CoVID-19 Coordinating Center and Data Center supported by NIH,
which provides coordinated and collaborative interactions with other NPRCs. The development of our strong
Quality Assurance and Quality Control Program and new High Containment Research Performance Core have
contributed greatly to our success during this funding period. In the next grant period, we will recruit additional
faculty and expand our research efforts into chronic and comorbid conditions associated with infections and
aging. We will focus on building onto our current successes with the generation of a new strategic plan that will
make TNPRC the best primate center we can be and a premiere place to work for our employees.","<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><AIDS/HIV><Accreditation><Aging><Animal

Structure-function studies of the membrane-interacting domains of HIV-1 Env spike,Structure-function studies of the membrane-interacting domains of HIV-1 Env spike,"Project Summary
Viral fusion proteins are fascinating protein folding machineries capable of adopting completely different
conformations during the fusion process; they are also important vaccine and therapeutic targets. Previous
studies have revealed both pre- and post-fusion conformations of the soluble fragments of many viral fusion
proteins, but less is known for structures of their fusion peptide, transmembrane (TM) and membrane-proximal
regions in the context of lipid bilayers. We hypothesize that membrane-interacting regions of other fusion proteins
related to HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) adopt defined oligomeric structures that are critical for the stability,
function and antigenicity of the full-length proteins in membrane. We have previously determined the structures
of the TM, membrane proximal external region, and cytoplasmic tail of HIV-1 Env in bicelles that mimic lipid
bilayers using the latest NMR technology. We find that these regions all form well-ordered trimeric clusters and
are conformationally coupled, and that disrupting them can reduce fusion and alter the antigenic structure of the
entire Env. In the current project, we propose to apply our NMR/bicelle technology to investigate the membrane
regions of SIV Env and the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), and to use cryo-electron microscopy to
determine structures of the full-length proteins reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs. We will define roles in membrane
fusion of critical structural elements of these regions by deep mutagenesis and functional assays. We will pursue
the following specific aims: 1) we will investigate the membrane-interacting components of SIV Env; 2) we will

Tulane National Primate Research Center,Tulane National Primate Research Center,"Project Summary – Overall
The Tulane National Primate Research Center (TNPRC) is affiliated with Tulane University of Louisiana and
was dedicated in 1964. The Center is part of Tulane University Health Sciences along with the School of
Medicine, the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, and the School of Science and Engineering. The
TNPRC is one of seven NIH-supported National Primate Research Centers within the National Primate Research
Center Program. This application requests funding for the five-year time-period of May 1, 2023-April 30, 2028.
Funds will be used to support administration, operations, animal resources, scientific research resources, a pilot
research program, alteration and renovations, outreach, and education and training activities of the Center. The
animal resources program is fully accredited by AAALAC with exemplary status. Significant infrastructure
projects have been completed including renovation of new laboratory space and completion of the PET/CT
facility within the RBL. We have completed a large infrastructure upgrade with upgraded boilers and new and
increased capacity chillers, new building automation and access controls and energy efficiency lighting
upgrades, as well as upgrades in stormwater and wastewater treatment improvements.
The period since the last renewal of the TNPRC base grant has been a time of sustained growth and
programmatic change. Total funding for the Center has increased to more than $43.8M in FY2021. The TNPRC
is the only NPRC to have a Regional Biosafety Laboratory (BSL-3), which has been a key factor in obtaining
funds to support numerous studies utilizing select agents, tuberculosis, and emerging infectious diseases,
including a new and expanding program in SARS-CoV-2 research. Our efforts in SARS-CoV-2 have provided
leadership within the NPRC system with the development of nonhuman primate models, testing therapeutics
and vaccines. In addition, we developed a CoVID-19 Coordinating Center and Data Center supported by NIH,
which provides coordinated and collaborative interactions with other NPRCs. The development of our strong
Quality Assurance and Quality Control Program and new High Containment Research Performance Core have
contributed greatly to our success during this funding period. In the next grant period, we will recruit additional
faculty and expand our research efforts into chronic and comorbid conditions associated with infections and
aging. We will focus on building onto our current successes with the generation of a new strategic plan that will
make TNPRC the best primate center we can be and a premiere place to work for our employees.","<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><AIDS/HIV><Accreditation><Aging><Animal

BD FACSymphony S6,BD FACSymphony S6,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal requests funds to purchase a BD FACSymphony S6 flow cytometric sorter to be housed in an
active and established core, the Flow Cytometry Core at the California National Primate Research Center
(CNPRC). The CNPRC is one of seven national designated primate research centers. Local, regional, and
national investigators pursue translational research at CNPRC that is relevant to immunology, infectious
disease, gene therapy and somatic cell genome editing, regenerative medicine and stem cell transplantation,
cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodevelopment. The instrument is requested to support >20 current
NIH-funded research projects from 6 Major Users and 11 Minor Users, as well as pending and future NIH-
funded research, that spans basic, translational, and even clinical research. These projects include studies of
therapeutic HIV vaccines, SIV pathogenesis, genome editing, retinal gene therapy, tissue-targeted AAV
vectors, and even a phase-1/2a human clinical trial of a next-generation COVID vaccine candidate, for which
mechanistic immunologic analysis will be performed at UC Davis. All these studies and indeed much of
modern biomedicine requires the ability to separately study functions of specific cell types, or even individual
cells. To perform such studies reproducibly and at an adequate quality level, furthermore, requires an
instrument that is consistently checked and maintained, and one that should be under service contract. The
BD FACSymphony S6 flow cytometric sorter will serve the increasing number of samples of our Users that are
currently stressing a >20-year-old FACSAria flow sorter. The FACSAria was purchased using institutional
funds and has been successfully maintained for an extraordinarily long serviceable lifetime, and was under
service contract continuously until BD no longer offered the contract. However, the age and wide use of the
older instrument impacts availability to the expanding NIH-funded research of our Major Users. Together,
these constraints are hampering the progress of NIH- funded projects in their laboratories as well as efforts of
their collaborators. The FACSymphony S6, with its greater selection of channels matched to those in our
analytic cytometers, better robustness, more consistent maintenance, and higher laser power, will significantly
advance our Major and Minor Users’ pursuits of novel mechanistic insights. We will integrate this instrument
into an existing CNPRC core facility, the Flow Cytometry Core, which is maintained by UC Davis and CNPRC
with significant infrastructure and oversight and advisory committees. The existing infrastructure will integrate
the operation, maintenance and management of the proposed instrument which will, in turn, stimulate new
research projects and innovations for many years.",<20 year old><20 years of age><2019-nCoV vaccine><AAV vector><AAV-based vector><Advisory Committees><Age><Body Tissues><COVID-19 vaccine><California><Cancers><Cardiovascular Diseases><Cell Body><Cells><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Clinical Trials><Communicable Diseases><Contract Services><Contracting Opportunities><Contracts><Core Facility><DNA Therapy><Flow Cytofluorometries><Flow Cytofluorometry><Flow Cytometry><Flow Microfluorimetry><Flow Microfluorometry><Funding><Future><Gene Transfer Clinical><Genetic Intervention><HIV vaccine><HIV/AIDS Vaccines><Human><Immunochemical Immunologic><Immunologic><Immunological><Immunologically><Immunologics><Immunology><Individual><Infectious Disease Pathway><Infectious Diseases><Infectious Disorder><Infrastructure><Institution><Investigators><Laboratories><Laser Electromagnetic><Laser Radiation><Lasers><Maintenance><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Minor><Modern Man><Modernization><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Neural Development><Pathogenesis><Phase><Primates><Primates Mammals><Progenitor Cell Transplantation><R-Series Research Projects><R01 Mechanism><R01 Program><Regenerative Medicine><Reproducibility><Request for Proposals><Research><Research Grants><Research Personnel><Research Project Grants><Research Projects><Researchers><Retinal gene therapy><SARS-CoV-2 vaccine><SARS-coronavirus-2 vaccine><SIV><Sampling><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 vaccine><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine><Simian Immunodeficiency Viruses><Stem Cell Transplantation><Stem cell transplant><Stress><Task Forces><Therapeutic Studies><Therapy Research><Tissues><Translational Research><Translational Science><United States National Institutes of Health><adeno-associated viral vector><adeno-associated virus vector><advisory team><age 20 years><ages><cardiovascular disorder><cell type><coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine><coronavirus disease-19 vaccine><flow cytophotometry><gene repair therapy><gene therapy><gene-based therapy><genetic therapy><genome editing><genomic editing><genomic therapy><human immunodeficiency virus vaccine><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><instrument><malignancy><nCoV vaccine><nCoV-19 vaccine><nCoV19 vaccine><neoplasm/cancer><neurodevelopment><next generation><novel><operation><operations><progenitor transplantation><somatic cell gene editing><somatic cell genome editing><somatic gene editing><somatic genome editing><stem and progenitor cell transplantations><translation research><translational investigation><twenty year old><twenty years of age><vaccine against 2019-nCov><vaccine against COVID-19><vaccine against SARS-CoV-2><vaccine against SARS-coronavirus-2><vaccine against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2><vaccine against Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2><vaccine candidate><vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2><vaccine for novel coronavirus><vaccines preventing COVID><vaccines to prevent COVID>,Biotechnology; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Immunization; Vaccine Related
Influence of HIV infection on vaginal virome and risk of preterm birth in pregnant South African women,Influence of HIV infection on vaginal virome and risk of preterm birth in pregnant South African women,"Pregnant women living with HIV (PWLHIV) are more likely to experience adverse birth outcomes, including
preterm birth (PTB), than pregnant women not living with HIV (PWNLHIV), thereby substantially contributing to
maternal and infant morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Alterations in bacteria of the vagina
vaginal have been linked to PTB but this cannot fully explain the increased risk. We found that although PWLHIV
had an increased vaginal bacterial diversity and higher prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated
bacteria compared to PWNLHIV, HIV infection was independently associated with PTB. Therefore, other
mechanisms must be in play. The role of vaginal viral communities, collectively referred to as “virome”, has not
been evaluated. Additionally, the mechanisms of HIV- versus ARV-induced PTB needs to be investigated so that
intervention measures can be identified to mitigate these risks.
The enteric virome appears to be altered during HIV infection. Expansion of bacteriophages, viruses that infect
bacteria, has been linked to immune cell expansion and increased inflammation in the gut and gut bacterial
diversity is mirrored in the virome. In non-pregnant WLHIV, viruses from four major viral families were found in
the upper female genital tract, but no comparison to PWNLHIV was made and the presence of bacteriophages
was not evaluated. A higher prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV), especially of high-risk types, has been
found in WLHIV compared to WNLHIV. However, to date, limited data exist on the effect of HIV on the collective
vaginal viral community, which is likely to be altered. Likewise, few studies have investigated the relationship
between the vaginal virome and PTB. Here we hypothesise that HIV infection leads to an expanded vaginal
virome, including increased number and diversity of bacteriophages, which either directly or indirectly (through
alteration of the bacterial microbiota) is associated with a higher PTB risk in PWLHIV. As part of this proposed
project, we will leverage the infrastructure and samples, as well as rigorous and extensive data of two ongoing
cohorts of pregnant women in Cape Town, South Africa to address this hypothesis with the following Specific
Aims:
Aim 1: To assess the effect of HIV, pregnancy and antiretroviral drugs on vaginal virome diversity and
composition. Hypothesis 1: PWLHIV have an expanded vaginal virome compared to PWNLHIV
Aim 2: To evaluate vaginal bacteriophage-host interactions in PWLHIV. Hypothesis 2: Viral communities
alter the bacterial component of the vagina through predator-prey dynamics
Aim 3: To compare vaginal virome diversity and composition in women experiencing PTB versus age-
and parity-matched women with normal birth outcomes. Hypothesis 3: Expansion of the vaginal virome is
responsible for increased rates of PTB.",<AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Address><Adenoviridae><Adenoviruses><Adjuvant><Adverse Experience><Adverse event><Africa South of the Sahara><African Females><African Women><Age><American><Anti-Retroviral Agents><Anti-viral Therapy><Antibiotic Agents><Antibiotic Drugs><Antibiotics><Bacteria><Bacterial Vaginitis><Bacterial Vaginosis><Bacteriophages><Base Sequence><Birth><CD4 Cells><CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes><CD4 T cells><CD4 helper T cell><CD4 lymphocyte><CD4+ T-Lymphocyte><CD4-Positive Lymphocytes><CRISPR><CRISPR/Cas system><Cell Body><Cell Count><Cell Number><Cells><Cervical><Chronologic Fetal Maturity><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats><Cohort Studies><Communities><Concurrent Studies><Data><Development><Disease><Disorder><Drugs><Enteral><Enteric><Eukaryota><Eukaryote><Family><Fetal Age><Genome><Genotype><Gestation><Gestational Age><HIV><HIV Infections><HPV><HPV infection><HTLV-III Infections><HTLV-III-LAV Infections><Herpesviridae><Herpesviruses><High Prevalence><High Risk Woman><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human Papilloma Virus><Human Papillomavirus><Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections><Human papilloma virus infection><Human papillomavirus infection><Immune><Immunes><In Vitro><Infectious Human Wart Virus><Inflammation><Infrastructure><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><LAV-HTLV-III><Link><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Maternal Age><Measures><Medication><Micro RNA><MicroRNAs><Miscellaneous Antibiotic><Modeling><Morphology><Nonspecific Vaginitis><Nucleic Acid Sequencing Molecular Biology><Nucleic acid sequencing><Nucleotide Sequence><Outcome><Papilloma Viruses><Papillomaviridae><Papillomavirus><Parturition><Peripheral><Persons><Phages><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Play><Postpartum Period><PrEP><Pregnancy><Pregnancy Outcome><Pregnant Women><Premature Birth><Prematurely delivering><Preterm Birth><Prokaryotae><Prokaryotic Cells><Risk><Risk Factors><Role><Sampling><Shotguns><South Africa><South African><Sub-Saharan Africa><Subsaharan Africa><T4 Cells><T4 Lymphocytes><Testing><Therapeutic><Vagina><Viral><Virus><Virus-HIV><Woman><adverse birth outcomes><age at pregnancy><ages><anti-retroviral><antiretroviral therapy><antiretroviral treatment><at-risk females><at-risk women><bacterial community><bacterial microbiome><bacterial virus><bacteriome><cohort><cytokine><developmental><drug/agent><expectant mother><expecting mother><experience><female genital tract><female reproductive tract><females at high risk><gene signatures><genetic signature><genital tract><herpes virus><high risk><high risk females><identification of viruses><improved><infant morbidity><infant morbidity/mortality><interventional strategy><maternal morbidity><metagenome sequencing><metagenomic sequencing><miRNA><miRNAs><microbial consortia><microbial flora><microbiota><microflora><multispecies consortia><new diagnostics><next generation diagnostics><non-specific vaginitis><novel diagnostics><nucleic acid sequence><parity><particle><plasmid vaccine><point of care testing><post-partum><pre-exposure prophylaxis><pregnant><pregnant mothers><premature childbirth><premature delivery><preterm delivery><prokaryote><reproductive tract><risk mitigation><shot gun><social role><vagina microbiota><vaginal flora><vaginal microbial community><vaginal microbiota><vaginal microflora><vector vaccine><viral infectious disease treatment><viral microbiome><virome><virus host interaction><virus identification><wart virus><women at high risk><women's genital tract><women's reproductive tract>,"Clinical Research; HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases; Maternal Health; Maternal Morbidity and Mortality; Microbiome; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Pregnancy; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn; Sexually Transmitted Infections; Women's Health Research"
Evaluating the Epidemiology and Determinants of Neurologic Post-acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2,Evaluating the Epidemiology and Determinants of Neurologic Post-acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 42 million
individuals in the United States and long-term complications are frequently reported, referred to as post-acute
sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). Even among survivors with mild acute illness, neurologic symptoms such
as chronic fatigue, dysautonomia, and cognitive impairment are frequently reported. To date, the etiology and
pathophysiology of neurologic PASC remain unclear; however, underlying autoantibodies and immune
activation are suspected. In our prospective COVID-19 ID Persistence Cohort (C-PIC), more than half of
COVID-19 survivors are reporting neurologic PASC at one year. We have identified an association between
neurologic PASC with both SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and ANA. Specifically, nucleocapsid (NP)
antibody levels are elevated compared to spike trimer (ST) antibody levels in participants with neurologic
PASC. Furthermore, our preliminary data has identified a potential signal linking neurologic PASC and
decreased gastrointestinal microbiota diversity. In this mentored career project, we hypothesize that
autoimmunity, immune activation, and microbiome dysbiosis are associated with neurologic PASC. Candidate:
As an Infectious Diseases physician with a master’s in public health and applied epidemiology and outbreak
training through the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Epidemic Intelligence Service, I am uniquely
positioned to study the epidemiology and determinants for neurologic PASC. My experience studying post-
Ebola syndrome in Liberia provided me with the foresight to contribute viral persistence and sequelae aims to
the C-PIC study, which includes longitudinal PASC survey data and biorepository specimens. Through the
guidance of my outstanding multidisciplinary team of mentors, I plan to fulfill my training objectives of (1)
developing expertise in advanced biostatistical analysis of survey data and (2) bridging translational research
and descriptive cohort data. Environment: My team of mentors at Columbia University Irving Medical Center
(CUIMC) are experts in epidemiology, biostatistics, immunology, and microbiome analysis. CUIMC also has a
long track record of enabling young physician-scientists to develop independent and successful careers in
academic medicine. Approach: We hypothesize that chronic fatigue, dysautonomia, and cognitive impairment
sub-phenotypes of neurologic PASC have different underlying pathophysiology, including autoimmunity,
immune activation, and microbiome dysbiosis. In Aim 1, we will characterize neurologic PASC epidemiology,
trajectory, and sub-phenotypes using longitudinal neurologic PASC surveys. In Aim 2, we will identify
associations between neurologic PASC with SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and autoantibodies. In Aim 3, we
will identify associations between neurologic PASC and immune activation and explore the role of gut
microbiota. This proposal provides an innovative approach to studying determinants for neurologic PASC, and
the proposed training will facilitate my transition into an independently funded clinician-scientist.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><2019-nCoV vaccine><ACE2><AIDS

Sample-to-answer HPV DNA nucleic acid test for cervical cancer screening in Mozambique,Sample-to-answer HPV DNA nucleic acid test for cervical cancer screening in Mozambique,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cervical cancer is the 4th most common female cancer and cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, despite
being preventable through HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination and early detection and treatment of
precancerous lesions. In high-income countries, cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates have been reduced
through HPV vaccination and screening based on cytology and HPV testing. However, in low- and middle-income
countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the burden of cervical cancer remains high due to a lack of effective
programs for vaccination and screening. While the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends cervical
cancer screening using a nucleic acid test to detect high-risk HPV DNA, most low- and middle-income countries
have difficulty implementing HPV testing due to the high cost of tests, the need for lab infrastructure and trained
personnel, and long sample-to-answer times. There is an urgent need for novel, low-cost, accurate, and
accessible approaches to improve screening.
The goal of this project is to develop a point-of-care HPV DNA test that meets WHO goals for cervical cancer
screening in low- and middle-income countries by adapting and integrating two innovations: 1) an extraction-
free, multiplexed, isothermal nucleic acid amplification assay; and 2) a fully integrated nucleic acid amplification
and lateral flow detection platform called NATFlow. The resulting NATFlow HPV test will be affordable, rapid,
and simple to use at the point-of-care. We aim to: 1) adapt existing extraction-free, multiplexed, sample-to-
answer Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assays to detect eight high risk types of HPV on the
NATFlow platform and demonstrate technical functionality with 140 provider-collected clinical specimens; (2)
evaluate clinical performance of the NATFlow HPV test in Mozambique, first in 558 banked preserved samples
and then prospectively in 1,890 women undergoing cervical cancer screening at Hospital Central de Maputo and
surrounding community clinics; and (3) evaluate barriers/facilitators to cervical cancer screening using the
NATFlow HPV test in Mozambique.
We have assembled an interdisciplinary team based in the US, Mozambique, and Australia with extensive
collective experience in developing, evaluating, commercializing, and scaling new technologies to prevent
cervical cancer. We have a strong record of carrying out translational and implementation research in low- and
middle-income countries including Mozambique. Our industrial team has expertise in developing and translating
well-designed instrumentation and chemistries for point-of-care tests. Our team is ideally suited to adapt,
validate, and prepare to scale the NATFlow HPV test to accelerate global efforts to prevent cervical cancer.",<AIDS Virus><Acceleration><Acetic Acids><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Address><Adoption><Africa South of the Sahara><Age><Application Context><Assay><Australia><Bioassay><Biological Assay><COVID assay><COVID surveillance><COVID-19 assay><COVID-19 surveillance><COVID19 assay><COVID19 surveillance><Cancer Cause><Cancer Etiology><Cancers><Caring><Cell Line><CellLine><Cervical><Cervical Cancer><Cervical Cancer Screening><Cervix Cancer><Cessation of life><Chemistry><Clinical><Communities><Country><Cytology><DNA><DNA amplification><Death><Death Rate><Deoxyribonucleic Acid><Detection><Devices><Diagnosis><Disease><Disorder><Disparities><Disparity><Early Diagnosis><Early treatment><Economic Income><Economical Income><Eligibility><Eligibility Determination><Enrollment><Equipment><Female><General Population><General Public><Goals><HIV><HPV><HPV Vaccination><HPV Vaccine><HPV detection><HPV screening><HPV-High Risk><Health><High Risk Oncogenic HPV><High risk HPV><High risk Human Papillomavirus><High risk Human papilloma virus><Hospitals><Hour><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human Papilloma Virus><Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination><Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine><Human Papilloma Virus detection><Human Papilloma Virus screening><Human Papillomavirus><Human Papillomavirus Vaccination><Human Resources><Human papillomavirus Vaccine><Immunization Programs><Improve Access><Incidence><Income><Industrialization><Infectious Human Wart Virus><Infrastructure><LAV-HTLV-III><LMIC><Lateral><Lesion><Low-resource area><Low-resource community><Low-resource environment><Low-resource region><Low-resource setting><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Malignant Cervical Neoplasm><Malignant Cervical Tumor><Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Malignant Tumor of the Cervix><Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri><Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm><Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor><Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri><Manpower><Mediating><Methods><Mozambique><New England><Northeastern United States><Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests><Nucleic Acid Testing><Nucleic Acids><Organizational Goals><Organizational Objectives><Performance><Portuguese East Africa><Preparation><Process><Protocol Screening><Provider><Qualifying><Recommendation><Reporting><Research Specimen><Resource-constrained area><Resource-constrained community><Resource-constrained environment><Resource-constrained region><Resource-constrained setting><Resource-limited area><Resource-limited community><Resource-limited environment><Resource-limited region><Resource-limited setting><Resource-poor area><Resource-poor community><Resource-poor environment><Resource-poor region><Resource-poor setting><Rice><Risk><SARS-CoV-2 assay><SARS-CoV-2 surveillance><Sampling><Sensitivity and Specificity><Specialty><Specimen><Strains Cell Lines><Sub-Saharan Africa><Subsaharan Africa><Technology><Temperature><Testing><Time><Training><Training and Infrastructure><Translating><Translational Research><Translational Science><Uterine Cervix Cancer><Vaccination><Vaccination Programs><Virus-HIV><Visual><Woman><Work><World Health Organization><ages><amplification and detection><amplification detection><burden of disease><burden of illness><carcinogenicity><cervical cancer early detection><cervical cancer prevention><cervical screening><commercialization><community clinic><community partners><community-based partners><contextual factors><coronavirus disease 2019 assay><coronavirus disease 2019 surveillance><coronavirus disease assay><coronavirus disease surveillance><cost><cultured cell line><design><designing><detection limit><detection of amplification><detection platform><detection system><diagnosis among females><diagnosis among women><diagnosis in females><diagnosis in women><diagnosis within females><diagnosis within women><disease burden><early detection><early therapy><enroll><experience><female diagnosis><future implementation><girls><high risk><implementation research><improved><incomes><innovate><innovation><innovative><instrument><instrumentation><isothermal amplification><lateral flow assay><lateral flow test><low and middle-income countries><low income country><malignancy><manufacture><medical specialties><mortality><mortality rate><mortality ratio><neoplasm/cancer><new technology><novel><novel technologies><nucleic acid detection><performance tests><personnel><point of care><point of care testing><precancer><precancer cervical detection><precancerous><premalignant><preparations><preservation><prevent><preventing><programs><prospective><screening><screenings><severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 assay><severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 surveillance><tool><translation research><translational investigation><usability><wart virus><women's diagnosis>,Bioengineering;

MEPCS (Multi-epitope protease cleavage sites) vaccine for protecting against SIV rectal transmission,MEPCS (Multi-epitope protease cleavage sites) vaccine for protecting against SIV rectal transmission,"Summary
Novel vaccine strategies is needed to develop a safe, effective, and broadly accessible HIV vaccine to
end the HIV pandemic. This proposal is built upon several innovative advancements. First, learned from
natural immunity observed in a group of HIV resistant Kenyan female sex workers, we found 12 protease
cleavage sites (PCS) in HIV are critical for virus maturation due to their essential function in tightly
controlled cleavage of Gag, Gag-Pol, and Nef precursor proteins. Sequences surrounding the HIV PCS
are immunogenic and highly conserved across global HIV subtypes, thereby a vaccine based on 12 PCS
immunogens will be globally accessible and likely to prevent virus escape mutations. Further, our recent
studies demonstrated that a PCS vaccine delivered by recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)
vector and nanoformulation protected more than 80% of vaccinated female Mauritian cynomolgus
macaques (MCMs) against SIVmac251 intravaginal challenges, which is associated with vaccine elicited
potent PCS-specific CD8 T cell responses. However, in previous studies, 12 PCS immunogens were
individually expressed in the rVSV. To improve vaccine immunogen presentation and facilitate the
vaccine preparation, 12 PCS immunogens should be expressed in a single cassette, i.e., multi-epitope
PCS (MEPCS). i.e., multi-epitope PCS (MEPCS). To that end, we have developed a cold-chain friendly
and long-term stable MEPCS-mRNA-LNP vaccine. We found that SIV MEPCS-mRNA-LNP vaccine
induced a potent PCS-specific CD8 T-cell immunity without inducing generalized inflammation and CD4
T-cell activation. Based on our strong preliminary date, we hypothesize that MEPCS vaccines would
protect rhesus macaques against SIVmac251 rectal transmission. The reason we will use a rhesus
macaque (RM)-SIV rectal challenge model is that the effectiveness of MEPCS vaccine needs to be
validated in the most rigorous rhesus macaques and anal sex is the most common HIV transmission in
the United States of America. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of cold-
chain friendly and long-term stable MEPCS-mRNA-LNP vaccine in comparison with rVSV-MEPCS
vaccines in protecting RMs against SIVmac251 intrarectal challenge and to better understand the
immune correlated protection. in this proposed study we will comparatively evaluate the effectiveness of
MEPCS-mRNA-LNP with rVSV-MEPCS vaccines against SIVmac251 intrarectal challenge in RMs. The
proposed study has the great potential to develop a new HIV/SIV vaccine to prevent HIV/SIV rectal
transmission. The novel MEPCS immunogens plus the cold-chain friendly and long-term stable mRNA-
LNP formulation makes this proposed study highly innovative and significant.

Engineering simian-compatible HIV-1,Engineering simian-compatible HIV-1,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Construction of infectious and pathogenic HIV-1, or HSIV -- an essentially HIV-1 backbone having minimal SIV
gene fragments -- for the simian model will bring tremendous value to studies of AIDS pathogenesis and to
vaccine and therapeutic reagents. Our preliminary data and previous findings on SHIV demonstrate that not
the Env and receptor/co-receptor molecules, but the inability of the entered HIV-1 to activate the initially resting
lymphocytes is the major culprit for the restriction of HIV-1 replication in monkey cells. Nef of SIVpbj1.9
(SNef), but not HIV-1, can sufficiently activate T cells such that the entered SIVpbj1.9 replicates robustly in the
resting T cells, causing the infected monkey to die of AIDS within a few weeks. We accordingly constructed
chimeric nef, HSNef, which harbors the 5’ 309 nucleotides (nts) of SIVpbj1.9 nef in place of the 5’ 221 nts of
HIV-1 nef, non-overlapping region with the long terminal repeat (LTR), and first tested whether the recombinant
Nef can activate T cells. Our data showed that HSNef itself sufficiently activated resting T cells, manifested by
IL2 generation and Nef-triggered IL2-promoter activity, while HIV-1 Nef (HNef) did not. Further, remarkably,
infection of HSIVnef -- which harbors all functional HIV-1 genes, except a small fragment of the SIVpbj1.9 nef,
HSNef, within an HIV-1 provirus -- into resting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMC) integrated
its provirus into host chromosomes without mitogenic activation and thereby replicated in the initially resting
hPBMC, whereas HIV-1 could not. These data demonstrated that the small fragment of SIVpbj1.9 nef in HIV-1
backbone was sufficient for replication of the entered HIV-1. Moreover, consistent with the SHIV replication
studies in monkeys, HSIVnef comprising HIV-1 Env replicated robustly in activated monkey PBMC (mPBMC),
again confirming that Env is not a restriction factor for HIV-1 entry into simian host. These data fundamentally
illuminate the molecular function of Nef in pathogenicity for development of the HIV-1/simian AIDS model.",<AIDS><AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Adherence><Aldesleukin Gene><Amino Acid Sequence><Apoptosis><Apoptosis Pathway><Biological><Cell Body><Cell Communication><Cell Interaction><Cell-to-Cell Interaction><Cells><Cellular Immune Function><Chromosomes><Data><Development><Disparate><Engineering><Foundations><Generations><Genes><Genetic><HIV><HIV Long Terminal Repeat><HIV-1><HIV-I><HIV1><Human><Human Immunodeficiency Virus LTR><Human Immunodeficiency Virus Long Terminal Repeat><Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human immunodeficiency virus 1><IL-2 Gene><IL2><IL2 gene><Immune><Immune response><Immunes><Immunological response><Immunomodulation><In Vitro><Infection><Interleukin 2 Precursor Gene><Interleukin-2 Gene><LAV-HTLV-III><Length><Life Cycle><Life Cycle Stages><Long Terminal Repeats><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Lymphatic cell><Lymphocyte><Lymphocytic><M mulatta><M. mulatta><Macaca mulatta><Mediating><Modeling><Modern Man><Modification><Molecular><Monkeys><Motility><Mucosa><Mucosal Tissue><Mucous Membrane><Nucleotides><PBMC><Pathogenesis><Pathogenicity><Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell><Primary Protein Structure><Programmed Cell Death><Proviruses><Reagent><Receptor Protein><Recombinants><Rest><Rhesus Macaque><Rhesus Monkey><Role><SAIDS><SHIV><SIV><Simian AIDS><Simian AIDSs><Simian Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome><Simian Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome><Simian Immunodeficiency Viruses><Solid><Spinal Column><Spine><T-Cell Activation><T-Cell Growth Factor Gene><T-Cells><T-Lymphocyte><TCGF Gene><Testing><Therapeutic><Tropism><Vaccines><Vertebral column><Viral Genes><Viral Pathogenesis><Virus><Virus Replication><Virus-HIV><activate T cells><backbone><biologic><developmental><host response><hypoimmunity><immune deficiency><immune function><immune modulation><immune regulation><immune system response><immunodeficiency><immunologic reactivity control><immunomodulatory><immunoregulation><immunoregulatory><immunoresponse><in vivo><life course><lymph cell><nucleic acid long terminal repeat><promoter><promotor><protein sequence><receptor><recombinant virus><simian HIV><simian human immunodeficiency virus><simian lymphoproliferative syndrome><social role><thymus derived lymphocyte><viral multiplication><viral replication><virus multiplication><virus pathogenesis>,Genetics; HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases
Discovery of human metapneumovirus epitopes,Discovery of human metapneumovirus epitopes,"Discovery of Human HLA T Cell Epitopes in Human Metapneumovirus
HMPV is a leading cause of lower respiratory infection in children and adults worldwide. Although nearly all
people are infected with HMPV by age 5 years, immunity to HMPV is incomplete and re-infections occur
throughout life. More severe disease occurs in persons with underlying conditions such as asthma, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV, or prematurity. Data from our group and others shows that T cells are
important to clear infection in mice and humans, yet T cell response can also contribute to disease severity.
Thus, characterizing the human T cell response to HMPV is important to guide safe and effective vaccine
development.
Our lab has established methods to discover human MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes using HLA-transgenic
(huHLA-tg) mice and human PBMCs. The huHLA-tg mice express different HLA supertypes, which collectively
capture a large proportion of different HLA alleles among diverse human populations. We propose to apply
these methods to discover HLA-restricted HMPV epitopes recognized by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. We will
screen both overlapping peptide pools and predictope peptides by ELISPOT against T cells derived from
huHLA-tg mice infected with HMPV. Individual epitope peptides that are confirmed by ELISpot will be ordered
as tetramers from the NIH Tetramer Core. Tetramers will be used to thoroughly analyze and characterize
HMPV epitope-specific CD8+ T cells, including: effector molecule production such as IFN-γ, TNF, IL-2,
perforin, and granzyme; degranulation using CD107a; transcription factor profile; and inhibitory receptor
expression. Dominant epitopes confirmed by tetramer staining will be tested for protective efficacy using
peptide vaccination and live virus challenge of mice. HLA-typed human PBMCs will be used to confirm bone
fide recognition of the epitopes by human CD8+ T cells. The results of this project will identify widely shared
HMPV epitopes that can be used to design candidate vaccines and evaluate the response to any HMPV
vaccine. These tools will be needed to understand human immune responses to both natural infection and
vaccines, which is important given the immune-mediated pathology associated with HMPV.",<(TNF)-α><0-11 years old><21+ years old><5 year old><5 years of age><AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Adult><Adult Human><Alleles><Allelomorphs><Anti-viral Therapy><Antibody Response><Antigenic Determinants><Assay><Asthma><Basal Transcription Factor><Basal transcription factor genes><Binding Determinants><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Bronchial Asthma><CD4 Cells><CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes><CD4 T cells><CD4 helper T cell><CD4 lymphocyte><CD4+ T-Lymphocyte><CD4-Positive Lymphocytes><CD8><CD8 Cell><CD8 T cells><CD8 lymphocyte><CD8+ T cell><CD8+ T-Lymphocyte><CD8-Positive Lymphocytes><CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes><CD8B><CD8B1><CD8B1 gene><COPD><Cachectin><Child><Child Youth><Children (0-21)><Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease><Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease><Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease><Clinical><Co-Stimulator><Costimulator><DENV vaccine><Data><Dengue Vaccine><Dengue virus vaccine><Development><Dimensions><Disease><Disorder><ELISPOT><Epidermal Thymocyte Activating Factor><Epitopes><Flow Cytofluorometries><Flow Cytofluorometry><Flow Cytometry><Flow Microfluorimetry><Flow Microfluorometry><Formalin><General Transcription Factor Gene><General Transcription Factors><Goals><Government><Granzyme><HIV><HLA-A><HLA-A gene><HLAA><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Human><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human Metapneumovirus><IFN-Gamma><IFN-g><IFN-γ><IFNG><IFNγ><IL-2><IL2 Protein><Immune><Immune Interferon><Immune response><Immunes><Immunity><Immunize><Immunocompromised><Immunocompromised Host><Immunocompromised Patient><Immunological response><Immunosuppressed Host><Individual><Industry><Infection><Interferon Gamma><Interferon Type II><Interleukin 2><Interleukin 2 Precursor><Interleukin II><Interleukin-2><Interleukine 2><Interleukine 2 Precursor><Interleukine II><Investigators><LAV-HTLV-III><LYT3><Life><Lower Respiratory Tract Infection><Lower respiratory infection><Lung><Lung Diseases><Lung Respiratory System><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Lymphocyte Mitogenic Factor><Macrophage-Derived TNF><Mediating><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Mitogenic Factor><Modern Man><Monocyte-Derived TNF><Murine><Mus><NIH><National Institutes of Health><PBMC><Pathogenesis><Pathology><Patients><Peptides><Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell><Persons><Phenotype><Population><Population Heterogeneity><Production><Pulmonary Diseases><Pulmonary Disorder><Pulmonary Pathology><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Respiratory syncytial virus><Severity of illness><Staining method><Stains><T cell based therapeutics><T cell based therapy><T cell directed therapies><T cell growth factor><T cell response><T cell targeted therapeutics><T cell therapy><T memory cell><T-Cell Epitopes><T-Cell Growth Factor><T-Cell Stimulating Factor><T-Cells><T-Lymphocyte><T-Lymphocyte Epitopes><T-cell therapeutics><T-cell transfer therapy><T4 Cells><T4 Lymphocytes><T8 Cells><T8 Lymphocytes><TNF><TNF A><TNF Alpha><TNF gene><TNF-α><TNFA><TNFα><Testing><Thymocyte Stimulating Factor><Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene><Transcription factor genes><Transgenic Mice><Tumor Necrosis Factor><Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha><United States National Institutes of Health><Vaccination><Vaccines><Viral><Virulent><Virus><Virus-HIV><Weight><adoptive T cell transfer><adoptive T-cell therapy><adulthood><age 5 years><bone><chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder><co-morbid><co-morbidity><comorbidity><cytokine><design><designing><develop a vaccine><develop vaccines><development of a vaccine><developmental><disease of the lung><disease severity><disorder of the lung><diverse populations><early childhood><enzyme linked immunospot assay><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><falls><five year old><five years of age><flow cytophotometry><heterogeneous population><host response><immune system response><immunogenicity><immunopathology><immunoresponse><immunosuppressed patient><kids><lFN-Gamma><lung disorder><lung histology><lung pathology><lymphocyte pore-forming protein><memory T lymphocyte><mouse model><murine model><older adult><older adulthood><pathogenic virus><peptide immunization><peptide vaccination><perforin><population diversity><pre-clinical><preclinical><premature><prematurity><protective efficacy><pulmonary><pulmonary histology><receptor expression><respiratory pathogen><response><therapeutic T-cell platform><thymus derived lymphocyte><tool><transcription factor><vaccine against DENV><vaccine against dengue><vaccine candidate><vaccine candidate against dengue><vaccine development><viral infectious disease treatment><viral pathogen><virus pathogen><weights><youngster>,Biotechnology; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Prevention; Vaccine Related
Targeting hepatitis B virus cccDNA during HBV/HIV co-infection,Targeting hepatitis B virus cccDNA during HBV/HIV co-infection,"Project summary
Coinfection with HBV and HIV-1 is common, and HIV coinfection can exacerbate progression of viral hepatitis and
accelerate liver disease progression. In fact, endstage liver diseases, including fiboris/cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma, have become the most common causes of death in people living with HIV (PWH) worldwide. HIV
infection cannot be cured currently but can be efficiently suppressed with highly active or combination anti-retroviral
therapy (HAART or cART). Currently available HBV drugs can suppress viral replication, but only a small subset of
patients are cured by these treatments. Although a prophylactic vaccine is available for HBV, it has no therapeutic
benefit. Consequently, new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to combat chronic HBV infection,
particularly in the context of HIV coinfection. Here, we will capitalize on several technical and conceptual
breakthroughs from our lab to establish proof-of-concept for interfering with persistent HBV infection virologically.
We have recently made important discoveries that provide a strong foundation for the major direction of this
proposal. The Ploss lab identified key components of the DNA lagging strand synthesis machinery that are
necessary and sufficient for formation of HBV cccDNA, the replication intermediate crucial for viral persistence.
Clinical data from HBV patients indicate that cccDNA turnover occurs relatively rapidly (several months), offering a
possibility of curing HBV with finite therapy by completely blocking cccDNA replenishment. Thus, we aim to
determine whether liver-specific transient genetic disruption of polymerases and other co-factors in vivo can
abrogate HBV infection (Aim 1). Since we recently demonstrated that HBV cccDNA formation is supported in mouse
hepatocytes, we can take advantage of the power of mouse genetics to rigorously test our hypothesis that genetic
distruption of host factors involved in cccDNA formation can abrogate HBV infection. Furthermore, we will extend
our analysis to blocking HBV chronicity in the context of an underlying HIV coinfection (Aim 2). To achieve this
goal, we will take advantage of a novel humanized mouse model co-engrafted with HLA-matched human
hepatocytes and components of a human hematolymphoid system. Our preliminary data demonstrate that such
dually engrafted mice support chronic infections with both HBV and HIV and can mount antigen-specific T cell
responses. This humanized mouse model provides unprecedented opportunities for studying the complex interplay
of HBV/HIV co-infections and will be deployed here to test rigorously whether blocking HBV cccDNA formation can
abrogate HBV persistence.
We will capitalize on our extensive complementary expertises in virology and immunology of HIV-1/HBV (Su),

The effect of HIV on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and emergence of variants of concern,The effect of HIV on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and emergence of variants of concern,"Project Summary
The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern is threatening global health and our ability to
prevent COVID-19 disease, raising concerns about a potential new wave of the pandemic. HIV may complicate
the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to eradicate the virus. While most people with a
competent immune system successfully clear SARS-CoV-2 infection within days, people living with HIV with
weakened immunity can carry persistent infection for months. Individuals with immunodeficiency may also
have a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection that can further extend the duration of infectiousness with high
viral load. As a result, chronically infected individuals are potentially contagious for an extended period of time
and may sustain transmission in the community. Similar to other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 accumulates mutations
over time as it replicates within the host. Therefore, chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of a
weakened immune system may provide the time and the environment needed for the virus to replicate and
evolve genetic mutations associated with survival advantages, including increased transmissibility and
resistance to COVID-19 vaccines or treatment. The proposed research aims to understand the overall impact
of HIV infection on the SARS-CoV-2 viral evolution and transmission dynamics in a setting with high HIV
prevalence. We will address current knowledge gaps by integrating SARS-CoV-2 genomic data, patient-level
clinical data, and epidemiological data to achieve the following aims: 1) we will determine the effect of HIV
infection on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants; and 2) we will
determine the effect of HIV-associated immunosuppression on the acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. For
the first Aim, advanced phylodynamic methods will be applied to determine how HIV affects the transmission
and viral evolution of SARS-CoV-2 on a population scale, as well as to describe risk factors that drive
individual and population-level COVID-19 transmission. For the second Aim, we will recruit and follow a cohort
of COVID-19 patients with and without HIV infection to determine the effect of HIV-associated
immunosuppression on the rate of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations. The proposed research will also utilize
active case finding to minimize sampling bias. Findings from this project will inform the development of optimal
public health interventions to control the pandemic by disrupting transmission chains and prevent the
emergence and spread of alarming variants.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><2019-nCoV vaccine><2019-nCoV variant><2019-nCoV variant forms><2019-nCoV variant strains><AIDS

Mechanisms and means to improve HIV bnAb activity in vivo,Mechanisms and means to improve HIV bnAb activity in vivo,"ABSTRACT
A number of anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting highly conserved and vulnerable
epitope regions of the envelope glycoprotein (Env) are being investigated for a range of clinical applications
based on their ability to robustly prevent infection in a variety of animal models. Successful monoclonal
antibody (mAb) prophylaxis aims to offer an alternative to vaccine development efforts, and the relatively long
half-lives and tolerability profiles of bNAbs promise to offer a complement to the small-molecule inhibitors
comprising current pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) options.
While bNAbs represent a promising approach to provide protection from infection, suppress plasma and tissue
viremia, and reduce viral reservoirs, results from the first major bNAb prevention efficacy trial were mixed.
Protection against infection with neutralization susceptible strains was observed, but fewer strains were
sufficiently susceptible than anticipated, and overall efficacy criteria were not met.
Our objective is to define and refine the means by which bNAbs can be used to restrict HIV replication in vivo
using a more stringent model in which their ability to delay or prevent systemic viremia in the context of seeded
HIV infection is monitored. We hypothesize that the antiviral activity afforded by a single bNAb can be
enhanced by one or more of two distinct strategies that will be rigorously tested for in vivo antiviral activity by
benchmarking their ability to delay detectable plasma viremia in the context of spreading infection. Guided by
strong preliminary data, the project goals will be achieved though completion of two Specific Aims: 1) Define
the ability of Fc engineering to improve bNAb antiviral activity across diverse envelope epitopes, 2) Define the
ability of bNAb combinations, with and without Fc engineering to improve bNAb antiviral activity. Each strategy
will be evaluated for effects on neutralization and effector function in vitro and in vivo for the ability to delay or
prevent systemic viremia.
Collectively, these studies will generate unprecedented insights into the means whereby bNAbs, if introduced in
early infection after mucosal exposure, delay or restrict viral spread thereby lowering the viral burden and
improving outcomes. This work will inform on both next-generation rational vaccine design and the ongoing
deployment of bNAb prophylaxis and therapy—driving innovation relevant to combatting HIV acquisition and
transmission across diverse intervention strategies and populations.","<AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Affinity><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Antibodies><Antibody Therapy><Antigenic Determinants><Automobile Driving><Benchmarking><Best Practice Analysis><Binding Determinants><Blood Plasma><Body Tissues><Clinical><Clinical Treatment Moab><Complement><Complement Proteins><Data><Development><Disease><Disorder><Engineering><Epitopes><Exhibits><Fc domain><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic defect><Glycoproteins><Goals><HIV><HIV Infections><HIV-1><HIV-I><HIV1><HTLV-III Infections><HTLV-III-LAV Infections><Human><Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections><Human immunodeficiency virus 1><In Vitro><In vivo analysis><Individual><Infection><Infection prevention><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Knowledge><LAV-HTLV-III><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Modeling><Modern Man><Monitor><Monoclonal Antibodies><Mucosa><Mucosal Tissue><Mucous Membrane><Mutation><Outcome><Plasma><Plasma Serum><Population><PrEP><Predisposition><Prevent infection><Prevention><Prophylactic treatment><Prophylaxis><Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma><SHIV><Susceptibility><Systemic infection><Testing><Tissues><Translational Research><Translational Science><Transmission><Treatment Efficacy><Vaccine Design><Viral><Viral Activity><Viral Antibodies><Viral Burden><Viral Function><Viral Load><Viral Load result><Viral Physiology><Viral reservoir><Viremia><Virus><Virus reservoir><Virus-HIV><Work><anti-viral antibody><antibody based therapies><antibody engineering><antibody treatment><antibody-based therapeutics><antibody-based treatment><benchmark><clinical applicability><clinical application><clinical efficacy><complementation><design><designing><develop a vaccine><develop vaccines><development of a vaccine><developmental><driving><efficacy clinical trial><genome mutation><improved><improved outcome><in vivo><in vivo evaluation><in vivo testing><infection risk><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><intervention efficacy><interventional strategy><mAbs><model of animal><monoclonal Abs><neutralizing antibody><next generation><non-human primate><nonhuman primate><pathogen><pre-clinical research><pre-exposure prophylaxis><preclinical research><prevent><preventing><prevention efficacy trial><simian HIV><simian human immunodeficiency virus><small molecular inhibitor><small molecule inhibitor><synergism><therapeutic efficacy><therapy efficacy><translation research><translational investigation><transmission process><vaccine development><viraemia><viral sepsis><virusemia>",Biotechnology; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Vaccine Related; Vaccine Related - AIDS
Exploiting glycan holes and sequence diversity of naturally occurring HIV envelope towards the design of vaccine immunogen panels for induction of neutralization breadth,Exploiting glycan holes and sequence diversity of naturally occurring HIV envelope towards the design of vaccine immunogen panels for induction of neutralization breadth,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Vaccine-mediated protection against viral pathogens frequently depends on neutralizing antibodies. However,
the HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein gp120 is heavily and variably glycosylated, resulting in a dynamic shield
that occludes conserved neutralization epitopes, impeding development of vaccination strategies to induce
neutralization of diverse viral strains. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) sometimes develop during chronic
HIV-1 infection, but limited information exists about how to recapitulate this process with vaccination. However,
evidence points to specific characteristics of the virus that establishes a new infection, the transmitted/founder
(T/F), and subsequent diversification of the Env viral quasispecies as important modulators for breadth
development. In our previous study, a vaccine expressing a novel clade C T/F Env (identified as Z1800M) from
a person living with HIV (PLWH) who developed elite plasma neutralization breadth, elicited the same tier 2
autologous neutralization specificity in immunized rhesus macaques (RM) as in early infection. The targeted
epitope comprised the V5 loop and portions of the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) on the Z1800M T/F Env gp120,
both highly exposed due to a pronounced lack of glycan coverage. Interestingly, exposure of CD4 contact
residues was modulated by naturally occurring changes in V5 in early escape variants. These results support
that this Env could potentially be exploited to maximize exposure of the CD4bs. To complement these results,
we acquired an extensive set of longitudinal Env sequences from PLWH Z1800M that supports strong selective
pressure during infection on two regions comprising bnAb epitopes: the CD4bs and V2 apex. Leveraging on this
wealth of data, we will use an innovative combination of sequence-based bioinformatic tools, artificial intelligence
and machine learning based in silico structural prediction approaches, and in vitro biochemical and immunologic
studies to select HIV-1 envelope vaccine immunogens that maximize exposure of epitopes recognized by
broadly neutralizing antibodies, including the CD4bs. We proposed to immunize nonhuman primates with the
Z1800M T/F Env to expose the CD4bs and sequentially boost with three longitudinal Envs down selected from
hundreds of sequences using our in silico and in vitro methods to maximize epitope exposure during vaccination.
We predict that this strategy will transition antibodies from autologous to heterologous neutralization, leading to
a translatable vaccine approach to advance into clinical studies.","<3-D structure><3-dimensional structure><3D structure><AI system><AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Adjuvant><Affinity><Antibodies><Antibody Binding Sites><Antigenic Determinants><Antigens><Apical><Artificial Intelligence><Autologous><B blood cells><B cell><B cells><B-Cells><B-Lymphocytes><B-cell><Base Sequence><Binding><Binding Determinants><Binding Sites><Bio-Informatics><Biochemical><Bioinformatics><Blood Plasma><Blood Serum><Cell Isolation><Cell Lineage><Cell Segregation><Cell Separation><Cell Separation Technology><Characteristics><Chronic><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Clinical Treatment Moab><Clonal Expansion><Combining Site><Complement><Complement Proteins><Computer Reasoning><Cryofixation><Cryopreservation><Data><Development><Epitope Mapping><Epitopes><Evolution><Exposure to><Genomics><Germ Lines><Glycans><Glycoproteins><HIV><HIV Envelope Glycoprotein gp120><HIV Envelope Protein gp120><HIV env Protein gp120><HIV envelope><HIV envelope protein><HIV-1><HIV-I><HIV1><HTLV-III gp120><Homing><Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human immunodeficiency virus 1><Immunization><Immunize><Immunochemical Immunologic><Immunologic><Immunological><Immunologically><Immunologics><Immunology><In Vitro><Infection><Interferometry><LAV-HTLV-III><Light><Lymph Node Reticuloendothelial System><Lymph node proper><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Lymphatic nodes><M mulatta><M. mulatta><Macaca mulatta><Machine Intelligence><Machine Learning><Maps><Mediating><Metabolic Glycosylation><Methods><Modeling><Molecular Interaction><Monoclonal Antibodies><Nucleotide Sequence><Paratopes><Pathway interactions><Persons><Phenotype><Photoradiation><Plasma><Plasma Serum><Polysaccharides><Population><Process><Protein Conformation><Reactive Site><Receptor Protein><Rectum><Resistance><Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma><Rhesus Macaque><Rhesus Monkey><Role><SEQ-AN><SHIV><Sequence Analyses><Sequence Analysis><Series><Serum><Site><Specificity><Testing><Time><Transmission><Vaccination><Vaccine Design><Vaccines><Variant><Variation><Viral><Virus-HIV><antibody combining site><bio-informatics tool><bioinformatics tool><breakthrough infection><cell sorting><cold preservation><cold storage><complementation><computational pipelines><design><designing><developmental><glycosylation><gp120><gp120 ENV Glycoprotein><gp120(HIV)><immunization strategy><immunogen><in silico><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><interest><lymph gland><lymph nodes><lymphnodes><mAbs><machine based learning><monoclonal Abs><multi-scale computational modeling><multi-scale mathematical modeling><multi-scale modeling><multiscale computational modeling><multiscale mathematical modeling><multiscale modeling><neutralizing antibody><non-human primate><nonhuman primate><novel><nucleic acid sequence><pathogenic virus><pathway><predictive tools><pressure><receptor><resistant><response><sample collection><simian HIV><simian human immunodeficiency virus><simulation><social role><specimen collection><synergism><three dimensional structure><transmission process><vaccination strategy><viral pathogen><virus characteristic><virus pathogen>",Bioengineering; Biotechnology; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Prevention; Vaccine Related; Vaccine Related - AIDS
Early life B cell responses and inflammation following SARS-CoV-2 infection,Early life B cell responses and inflammation following SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Abstract
As of March 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 50 million infections and 2 million
deaths, constituting an unprecedented pandemic in the modern world. While infected individuals
rapidly develop IgG responses against the viral Spike after infection, some studies have
indicated that individuals with mild infection generate weaker neutralizing Ab responses
compared to those with severe disease. The durability of the immune response following natural
infection and its afforded protection against subsequent infections and emerging related variants
remain unclear. Interestingly, unlike other respiratory viruses, children are rarely develop severe
disease following SARS CoV-2 infection. Antibody responses in hospitalized children and those
who developed the multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) have been characterized, but,
there is a gap in knowledge of the magnitude, quality, durability, and breadth of antibody
responses in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children, responses that may contribute to
making children less susceptible to severe infection compared to adults. Moreover, the
possibiltiy of reinfection or infection with a novel variant in previously-infected children is not
known, making the possibility of restarting congregate settings for children without a childhood
vaccine quite challenging. Our overarching goal is to characterize the kinetics, function,
breadth, and durability of humoral immune responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection across
the pediatric age spectrum in comparison to that of adults. We hypothesize that pediatric
immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection is distinct from that of adults, and associates with
protection against symptomatic disease and durability of immunity. Using samples from two
unique ongoing community studies of SARS-CoV-2 infections in adults and children, we will test
our hypothesis through the following aims: 1) Define the similarities and differences in the
kinetics, magnitude, specificity, function and durability of SARS-CoV-2-specific Ab responses in
children and adults; 2) Investigate the breadth and potency of antibody responses in SARS-
CoV-2-infected children against established and predicted variants of SARS-CoV-2; and 3)
Define the SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell repertoire and characterize the potency of pediatric
SARS CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibodies. These evaluations will identify immune correlates
of protection against severe disease and provide insights for immunization strategies towards
the long term control of SARS CoV-2 which will likely become an endemic pathogen.",<0-11 years old><18 year old><18 years of age><2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><2019-nCoV

"The HIV Nexus Scholars Program: A Research Education Program for Early-Stage Investigators Working at the Intersection of Biomedical, Social/Behavioral, and Clinical Science","The HIV Nexus Scholars Program: A Research Education Program for Early-Stage Investigators Working at the Intersection of Biomedical, Social/Behavioral, and Clinical Science","PROJECT SUMMARY
This application supports the launch of the innovative HIV Nexus Scholars Program at the University of
California, San Francisco (UCSF) under NIAID PAR-20-289. This program will leverage a rich infrastructure of
training, research, and expertise to address cross-cutting, high-priority areas in the 2019/2020 Office of AIDS
Research (OAR) Strategic Plan and NIAID mission, including the integration of state-of-the-art biomedical,
social/behavioral, and clinical science; health inequities research; and training and diversifying the research
workforce to conduct high-priority HIV research. Our program will provide three years of education, research
experiences, and mentoring to early-stage investigators (ESIs) from outside institutions who have not yet
attained R01-level funding, but who demonstrate a commitment to improving the health of U.S. marginalized
communities (e.g., racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minorities) disproportionately affected by HIV, and are
initiating innovative research at the intersection of biomedical, social/behavioral, and clinical science. Scientists
from or closely connected to the most impacted communities are often best positioned to lead research that
addresses the specific needs of the affected populations, consistent with the objectives of the 2019/2020 Office
of AIDS Research Strategic Plan and the critical need to foster diverse scholars in the HIV research pipeline.
The centerpiece of the Nexus Scholars Program is an intensive six-week annual training institute in which
Scholars are in residence at UCSF for three consecutive summers, where they meet frequently with mentors,
connect with other researchers, participate in skills-development short courses/seminars, develop and
implement applied research experience plans, and conceptualize and write NIH funding applications. Such
training will provide a foundation for the next generation of HIV researchers who are prepared to continue and
outpace the recent momentum to end the HIV epidemic, particularly in communities disproportionately
affected.",<AACTG><ACTG><AIDS><AIDS Virus><AIDS clinical trial group><AIDS/HIV><Acceleration><Acquired Immune Deficiency><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Address><Affect><Applications Grants><Applied Research><Applied Science><Area><Behavioral><Behavioral Sciences><California><Clinical><Clinical Sciences><Cohort Studies><Communities><Concurrent Studies><Data><Data Analyses><Data Analysis><Development><Development Plans><Education><Educational aspects><Elements><Environment><Epidemic><Fostering><Foundations><Funding><Geography><Grant><Grant Proposals><HIV><HIV Vaccine Trials Network><HIV disparities><HIV inequalities><HIV inequities><HIV related disparities><HIV related inequities><HIV/AIDS><HIV/AIDS disparities><HIV/AIDS inequities><HIV/AIDS related disparities><HVTN><Health><Health Inequity><History><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Individual><Inequalities in Health><Inequities in Health><Institution><Investigators><Knowledge><LAV-HTLV-III><Lead><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Manuscripts><Medicine><Mentors><Mission><NIAID><NIH><National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease><National Institutes of Health><Pb element><Peer Review><Population><Position><Positioning Attribute><Prevention><Prevention Research><Process><Program Development><Recording of previous events><Research><Research Infrastructure><Research Personnel><Research Proposals><Researchers><San Francisco><Scholars Program><Science><Scientist><Secure><Social Sciences><Strategic Planning><Structure><Training><Training and Infrastructure><Underrepresented Ethnic Minority><Underrepresented Minority><United States National Institutes of Health><Universities><Virus-HIV><Writing><acquired immunodeficiency syndrome clinical trial group><career><career development><cohort><community marginalization><data interpretation><developmental><education research><ethnic minority><experience><gender minority><health inequalities><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><histories><human capital><improved><innovate><innovation><innovative><marginalized community><marginalized group><marginalized individual><marginalized people><marginalized population><multidisciplinary><next generation><peer><peer networks><professor><programs><racial minority><residence><residential building><residential site><response><sexual minority><skill acquisition><skill development><skills><social><social capital><support network><under-representation of minorities><under-represented minority><underrepresentation of minorities><webinar>,Behavioral and Social Science; HIV/AIDS; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Infectious Diseases; Social Determinants of Health

Accelerating B Cell and Antibody Molecular, Functional and Structural Analysis
 in Sequential bnAb-inducing Env Immunogen Clinical Trials
 Development of an effective HIV vaccine is essential for achieving long-term immunity to prevent new HIV
infections globally. A successful HIV vaccine regimen will likely need to induce potent broad neutralizing
antibodies (bnAbs) to contemporary circulating viral strains. New HIV Env immunogen designs, guided by
knowledge of bnAb interactions with envelope epitopes and their B cell clonal lineage development in natural
HIV infection, have entered first in human studies in the HVTN. These phase 1 “discovery” trials rely on more
efficient, near real-time molecular, functional, and structural analyses of B cell and antibody responses. To meet
this expectation, the HVTN Laboratory Center proposes to continue expansion and improvement of laboratory
and analytical capacity that can accelerate iterative evaluation of bnAb-inducing vaccine candidates. The
supplemental funds for the HVTN Laboratory make it possible to fully access evolving immunologic, molecular,
and structural technology, which deepens our laboratory analyses and increases throughput of data generation
and interpretation. To accomplish this, we will sustain the employment of additional dedicated trained staff and
equipment to increase laboratory throughput of B cell repertoire, antibody binding with epitope mapping,
neutralization, and antibody structural analyses. These funds will continue to enable efficient laboratory
operations and integration of the scientific partnerships between key investigators at Fred Hutch, Duke
University, and the Scripps Research Institute.",<AIDS Virus><Ab response><Acceleration><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Antibodies><Antibody Formation><Antibody Production><Antibody Response><Antigenic Determinants><Antigens><Assay><Award><B blood cells><B cell><B cell repertoire><B cells><B-Cells><B-Lymphocytes><B-cell><Binding><Binding Determinants><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Blood Serum><Cancer Center><Clinical Trials><Cryo-electron Microscopy><Cryoelectron Microscopy><Data><Data Set><Dedications><Development><Electron Cryomicroscopy><Electrons><Employment><Epitope Mapping><Epitopes><Equipment><Evaluation><Evolution><Funding><Generations><Goals><HIV><HIV Infections><HIV Vaccine Trials Network><HIV vaccine><HIV-1><HIV-I><HIV/AIDS Vaccines><HIV1><HTLV-III Infections><HTLV-III-LAV Infections><HVTN><Human><Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections><Human immunodeficiency virus 1><Immunity><Immunochemical Immunologic><Immunologic><Immunological><Immunologically><Immunologics><Individual><Infrastructure><Investigators><Knowledge><LAV-HTLV-III><Laboratories><Light><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Memory B Cell><Memory B-Lymphocyte><Microscopic><Modern Man><Molecular><Molecular Interaction><Negative Beta Particle><Negatrons><Pathway interactions><Phase><Phenotype><Photoradiation><Preventative vaccine><Preventive vaccine><Prophylactic vaccine><Quality Control><Reagent><Regimen><Research Institute><Research Personnel><Researchers><Serum><Single cell seq><Sorting><Specificity><Technology><Testing><Time><Training><Universities><Vaccine Clinical Trial><Vaccines><Viral><Virus-HIV><antibody biosynthesis><assay development><cryo-EM><cryoEM><cryogenic electron microscopy><design><designing><developmental><expectation><first in man><first-in-human><gene signatures><genetic signature><human immunodeficiency virus vaccine><immunogen><immunoglobulin biosynthesis><improved><neutralizing antibody><novel><operation><operations><pathway><phase 1 trial><phase I trial><prevent><preventing><scale up><single cell next generation sequencing><single cell sequencing><vaccine antibodies><vaccine candidate><vaccine induced antibodies><vaccine strategy><vaccine-induced antibodies><ward>,Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Vaccine Related; Vaccine Related - AIDS
Durability of systemic and lung immune correlates of BCG-induced protection against M. tuberculosis infection,Durability of systemic and lung immune correlates of BCG-induced protection against M. tuberculosis infection,"Project summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes more deaths worldwide than any other infectious agent and is
increasingly characterized by antimicrobial resistance. An effective vaccination strategy to prevent establishment
of M.tb infection and progression to tuberculosis (TB) disease is a priority to achieve rapid control of the global
TB epidemic, but development and clinical testing of new vaccines is hampered by the lack of immune correlates
of protection. Revaccination of adolescents with the only licenced vaccine against TB, Bacille Calmette-Guerin
(BCG), partially protected against established M.tb infection, providing the first efficacy signal for a novel TB
vaccination strategy in a high-risk population. There is a one-time opportunity to leverage this existing cohort, as
well as newly enrolled participants in a larger confirmatory phase 2b clinical trial, to identify and test the durability
of immune correlates of protection against established M.tb infection in the lung, which could harbour critically
different immune responses compared to peripheral blood.
Blood and bronchoalveaolar lavage specimens will be collected to identify and determine longevity of vaccine-
induced systemic and pulmonary immune responses that correlate with protection against sustained M.tb
infection. The durability of vaccine-induced protection against infection ~6 years after vaccination will also be
explored.
Novel and robust technologies, such as polychromatic flow cytometry, mass cytometry and systems serology will
be applied to study adaptive and innate immune responses in participants enrolled in two BCG efficacy trials at
6 months and ~6 years after vaccination as well as 1 month and 4-5 years after primary M.tb infection. The
overarching hypothesis is that BCG vaccination induced multiple arms of the immune system and that a
combination of Th1/Th17 and IgA responses is associated with lower risk of established M.tb infection.
This approach will: 1) Identify and assess durability of BCG-mediated systemic and pulmonary immune
responses in M.tb-uninfected individuals; 2) Define systemic and pulmonary immune correlates of post-
M.tb exposure protection against established M.tb infection in participants experiencing transient (protected)
or sustained (unprotected) M.tb infection. Identification of vaccine-induced immune responses important for
protection against established M.tb infection would enhance our understanding of early containment of M.tb and
could inform immune correlates of protection against TB disease.
By extending the follow-up of the first BCG revaccination trial and comparing rates of M.tb infection in participants
from the BCG and placebo arms, we will also 3) Measure the durability of vaccine-mediated prevention of
sustained M.tb infection for at least 6 years post-vaccination, which, if significant, would provide impetus to
conduct larger trials testing for efficacy to prevent TB disease in endemic populations.",<AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Active Follow-up><Adolescent><Adolescent Youth><Antibodies><Antimicrobial Resistance><Assay><BCG Live><BCG Vaccine><BCG immunization><BCG vaccination><BCG-vaccinated><Bacille Calmette Guerin vaccine><Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccinated><Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination><Bacille Calmette-Guérin><Bacillus Calmette Guerin Vaccine><Bacillus Calmette Guérin><Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination><Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination><Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Blood><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Blood Sample><Blood specimen><CSIF><CSIF-10><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cessation of life><Clinical Evaluation><Clinical Testing><Clinical Trials><Collection><Containment><Country><Cytokine Synthesis Inhibitory Factor><Cytometry><Data><Death><Development><Disease><Disorder><Epidemic><Flow Cytofluorometries><Flow Cytofluorometry><Flow Cytometry><Flow Microfluorimetry><Flow Microfluorometry><Genus Mycobacterium><HIV><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><IL-10><IL10><IL10A><IgA><Immune><Immune response><Immune system><Immunes><Immunochemical Immunologic><Immunoglobulin A><Immunologic><Immunological><Immunological response><Immunologically><Immunologics><Individual><Infection><Infectious Agent><Innate Immune Response><Interleukin 10 Precursor><Interleukin-10><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><LAV-HTLV-III><Lavage><Length of Life><Licensing><Liquid substance><Longevity><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Lung immune response><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><M mulatta><M tb><M tuberculosis><M tuberculosis infection><M. mulatta><M. tb><M. tb infection><M. tuberculosis><M. tuberculosis infection><M.tb infection><M.tuberculosis infection><MTB Immunization><MTB Vaccination><MTB infection><MTB vaccine><Macaca mulatta><Measures><Mediating><Mycobacterium><Mycobacterium tuberculosis><Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection><Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection><Myelogenous><Myeloid><Outcome><Outcome Study><Participant><Phase><Placebos><Population><Predisposition><Prevention><Primary Infection><Proteomics><Public Health><Research Specimen><Rhesus Macaque><Rhesus Monkey><Risk><Sampling><Serology><Sham Treatment><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Site><Specimen><Susceptibility><System><TB immunization><TB infection><TB vaccination><TB vaccine><Technology><Testing><Time><Tuberculosis><Tuberculosis Vaccines><Vaccination><Vaccination acquired immunity><Vaccination induced immunity><Vaccine for TB><Vaccine for Tuberculosis><Vaccines><Virus-HIV><active followup><adaptive immune response><anti-TB vaccine><anti-microbial resistant><arm><biological signal transduction><clinical test><cohort><confirmatory efficacy trial><confirmatory trial><cost effectiveness><determine efficacy><developmental><disseminated TB><disseminated tuberculosis><efficacy analysis><efficacy assessment><efficacy determination><efficacy evaluation><efficacy examination><efficacy testing><efficacy trial><evaluate efficacy><examine efficacy><experience><flow cytophotometry><fluid><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><high risk group><high risk individual><high risk people><high risk population><host response><immune response to vaccination><immune response to vaccines><immune system response><immunization strategy><immunoresponse><improved><infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis><infectious organism><interventional strategy><juvenile><juvenile human><lavage therapy><liquid><mtb><new vaccines><next generation vaccines><novel><novel vaccines><participant enrollment><patient enrollment><peripheral blood><prevent><preventing><pulmonary><pulmonary immune response><research clinical testing><resistance to anti-microbial><resistant to antimicrobial><response><sham therapy><tuberculosis immunization><tuberculosis infection><tuberculosis vaccination><tuberculous spondyloarthropathy><vaccination against tuberculosis><vaccination strategy><vaccination study><vaccination trial><vaccine acquired immunity><vaccine against M. tuberculosis><vaccine against Mtb><vaccine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis><vaccine against TB><vaccine against tuberculosis><vaccine associated immune response><vaccine associated immunity><vaccine candidate><vaccine candidates against tuberculosis><vaccine efficacy><vaccine immune response><vaccine immunogenicity><vaccine induced immune response><vaccine response><vaccine responsiveness><vaccine study><vaccine trial><vaccine-induced immunity><vaccine-induced protection><vaccine-induced response>,Biodefense and Related Countermeasures;

Delineating HIV-1 nuclear import mechanisms through capsid interaction with MxB and the nuclear pore complex,Delineating HIV-1 nuclear import mechanisms through capsid interaction with MxB and the nuclear pore complex,"ABSTRACT
Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) causes life-long infection, which requires taking antiviral drugs to
control the infection. No vaccines are available against this virus. The HIV-1 cone-shaped capsid core, made up
of capsid protein (CA), protects the HIV-1 genome, plays a major role in HIV-1 infection and interacts with several
host factors involved in nuclear import of viral complexes and integration into the host genome. The myxovirus
resistance protein B (MxB) is thought to restrict HIV-1 infection by inhibiting uncoating and blocking nuclear entry,
the latter measure by 2-Long Terminal Repeats (2-LTR) circles inside the nucleus. However, MxB does not
inhibit the appearance of CA inside the nucleus of infected cells, even when infection is inhibited. Additionally,
measuring 2-LTR circles in the nucleus, which is a marker for HIV-1 nuclear import, does not correlate with
productive infection. Currently, little is known about the kinetics and sites of HIV-1 uncoating and the role of MxB
in regulating this process. HIV-1 nuclear import is also not completely understood. Several nucleoporins (NUPs),
which form the nuclear pore complex (NPC), interact with CA to promote HIV-1 nuclear import. The NPC was
previously thought to be a static structure with an inner diameter of ~40nm, too small to allow nuclear import of
the 60nm-wide HIV-1 capsid core, leading to an assumption that HIV-1 has to uncoat before entering the nucleus.
However, recent evidence suggests that NPC is a dynamic structure that may expand and that HIV-1 cone-
shaped cores can enter the nucleus. Little is known about how the NPC and MxB interactions with HIV-1 CA
respectively promote or inhibit HIV-1 infection. Therefore, I hypothesize that the NPC-associated MxB blocks
nuclear import by inhibiting uncoating and that the nuclear import of HIV-1 core requires expansion of
the nuclear pore complex. In the two Specific Aims of this proposal, I will investigate the HIV-1 nuclear import
and CA core disassembly in the presence of MxB (Aim 1) and delineate the changes in nuclear pore architecture
caused by HIV-1 (Aim 2) using advance microscopy techniques. In Aim 1, I will determine HIV-1 nuclear entry
inhibition by MxB through visualizing the presence of fluorescently labeled integrase-superfolderGFP (INsfGFP)
inside the nucleus. I will also examine HIV-1 uncoating by visualizing loss of a fluorescently labeled cyclophilin
A derivative, which binds to CA with high avidity. In Aim 2, I will examine changes in the nuclear pore size upon
HIV-1 infection using super-resolution microscopy. I will infect NUP-labeled cells with HIV-1 CA mutant, which
fails to transport to the nucleoplasm and remains associated with NPC. I will then visualize the NPC with
Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy and Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy
(STORM). This project will provide me with diverse training in virology, cell biology and advanced microscopy
techniques and will advance our understanding of HIV-1 nuclear import mechanisms. In the long-term, my work
may support development of novel antiviral drugs that can mitigate HIV-1 infection.",<Anti-viral Agents><Appearance><Architecture><Avidity><Binding><Capsid><Capsid Proteins><Cell Body><Cell Nucleus><Cells><Cellular biology><Centers for Disease Control><Centers for Disease Control and Prevention><Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)><Coat Proteins><Complex><Cone><Core Protein><Cryo-electron Microscopy><Cryoelectron Microscopy><Cyclophilin A><Cytoplasm><Data><Development><Diameter><Docking><Drug Targeting><EC 2.7.7.49><Electron Cryomicroscopy><Electron Microscopy><Engineering / Architecture><Fluorescence Agents><Fluorescent Agents><Fluorescent Dyes><Foundations><Genome><Goals><HIV-1><HIV-I><HIV1><Host Factor><Host Factor Protein><Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1><Human immunodeficiency virus 1><IFN><Image><Imaging Procedures><Imaging Technics><Imaging Techniques><Infection><Infection Control><Integrase><Integration Host Factors><Interferons><Kinetics><Label><Light><Long Terminal Repeats><Measures><Mediating><Microscopy><Modeling><Molecular><Molecular Interaction><Myxovirus><NPC><Nuclear><Nuclear Import><Nuclear Pore><Nuclear Pore Complex><Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins><Nucleoplasm><Nucleoporin Gene><Nucleoporins><Nucleus><Nup Protein><Optics><Persons><Photoradiation><Physiologic><Physiological><Play><Process><Productivity><Proteins><RNA Transcriptase><RNA-Dependent DNA Polymerase><RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase><Research><Resistance><Reverse Transcriptase><Revertase><Ribonucleoproteins><Role><Shapes><Site><Structure><Techniques><Testing><Training><United States Centers for Disease Control><United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention><Vaccines><Viral><Viral Coat Proteins><Viral Outer Coat Protein><Viral Reverse Transcription><Virion><Virus><Virus Particle><Visualization><Work><access to vaccination><access to vaccines><anti-viral compound><anti-viral drugs><anti-viral medication><anti-viral therapeutic><anti-virals><cell biology><cryo-EM><cryoEM><cryogenic electron microscopy><developmental><fluorescent dye/probe><genomic RNA><imaging><insight><interferon-induced protein Mx><light microscopy><live cell image><live cell imaging><live cellular image><live cellular imaging><mutant><myxovirus resistance proteins><myxovirus resistant protein><novel><nucleic acid long terminal repeat><optical><overexpress><overexpression><protein B><protein Mx><reconstruction><resistant><response><social role><superresolution imaging><superresolution microscopy><treatment strategy><vaccination access><vaccination availability><vaccine access><vaccine availability><viral genomics><virology><virus genomics>,HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases
The role of conformational dynamics of enveloped virus spike proteins in cell entry,The role of conformational dynamics of enveloped virus spike proteins in cell entry,"Research Abstract: The spike/fusion glycoproteins residing on the surface of human enveloped viruses are
targets of immune response and are the focus of researchers developing vaccines and antiviral treatments. The
conformational dynamics of spike proteins drive the entry of enveloped viruses into cells via viral membrane
fusion and facilitate antibody recognition. However, the lack of deep insights into dynamics has prevented a
complete elucidation of the molecular mechanism by which spike proteins promote virus entry. Many viruses,
such as coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and HIV-1, share a similar viral fusion
mechanism (type-I) mediated by their respective spike proteins. These spikes undergo dramatic structural
changes, and the energy released from conformational transitions overcomes the fusion kinetic barriers.
However, our understanding of the multi-step fusion process mainly relies on individual structural snapshots of
spike proteins at fusion endpoints. How these endpoints are correlated in a time-resolved manner and the order
and frequency of conformational events underlying virus entry remain largely elusive. The proposed research
extends our efforts to explore viral membrane fusion and is supported by our experience probing the
conformational dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoproteins. The overarching
goal of this project is to integrate our knowledge into a generic working model that will describe a time-resolved
stepwise framework of the type-I fusion mechanism, in which the conformational trajectories of fusion proteins
are explicitly defined in space and time. We pioneered the use of the single-molecule Förster resonance energy
transfer (smFRET) to study S and revealed multiple S conformations on the virus. We delineated sequential
transitions of S from closed to open conformations upon activation by cellular receptors. We provided the first
experimental evidence of decelerated transition dynamics from open states, suggesting increased stability of the
fusion-reactive open state to be part of the SARS-CoV-2 adaption strategies. Here, we will use an integrated
platform of smFRET and virus-to-cell fusion in combination with computational and structural tools to reveal the
conformational plasticity S adapts during virus evolution and to visualize the conformational trajectory S
undergoes during fusion. We will perform comparative studies on another respiratory virus - RSV fusion (F)
protein, with interest in other type-I spike proteins of newly emerging viruses. We will elucidate conformational
events and transition dynamics of F-mediated viral membrane fusion and evaluate whether conformation-
presentation of F-based vaccine candidates represents the predominant state exposed to the host. The studies
are expected to allow us to identify the common and divergent traits of the S- and F-mediated fusion processes
that will advance our knowledge and help us define the common theme of the type-I fusion mechanism. We
envision that this program of research using different advanced technologies will reveal unrecognized insights
into virus entry that lay the foundation for advances in anti-viral interventions, in line with the mission of NIGMS.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><2019-nCoV S protein><2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein><2019-nCoV spike protein><Antibodies><COVID-19 S protein><COVID-19 spike><COVID-19 spike glycoprotein><COVID-19 spike protein><COVID-19 virus><COVID19 virus><Cell Body><Cell fusion><Cells><Chimera Protein><Chimeric Proteins><CoV-2><CoV2><Comparative Study><Deceleration><Event><Evolution><Exposure to><FRET><Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer><Foundations><Frequencies><Fusion Protein><Future><Förster Resonance Energy Transfer><Glycoproteins><Goals><HIV-1><HIV-I><HIV1><Human><Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1><Human immunodeficiency virus 1><Immune Targeting><Immune response><Immunological response><Individual><Infection><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Investigators><Kinetics><Knowledge><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Mediating><Membrane Fusion><Mission><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><Molecular Configuration><Molecular Conformation><Molecular Stereochemistry><NIGMS><National Institute of General Medical Sciences><Process><Proteins><Public Health><Receptor Protein><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Respiratory syncytial virus><Role><SARS Virus><SARS corona virus><SARS corona virus 2><SARS coronavirus><SARS-Associated Coronavirus><SARS-CO-V2><SARS-COVID-2><SARS-CoV><SARS-CoV-1><SARS-CoV-2><SARS-CoV-2 S><SARS-CoV-2 S protein><SARS-CoV-2 spike><SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein><SARS-CoV-2 spike protein><SARS-CoV2><SARS-Related Coronavirus><SARS-associated corona virus 2><SARS-associated coronavirus 2><SARS-coronavirus-2><SARS-related corona virus 2><SARS-related coronavirus 2><SARSCoV2><Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus><Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome CoV 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Corona Virus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome corona virus><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus 2><Severe acute respiratory syndrome associated corona virus 2><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 S protein><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike glycoprotein><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein><Severe acute respiratory syndrome related corona virus 2><Surface><Technology><Time><Vaccines><Viral><Virus><Visualization><Wuhan coronavirus><biochemical tools><biochemistry tools><biophysical equipment><biophysical tools><conformation><conformational><conformational conversion><conformational state><conformational transition><conformationally><conformations><coronavirus disease 2019 S protein><coronavirus disease 2019 spike glycoprotein><coronavirus disease 2019 spike protein><coronavirus disease 2019 virus><coronavirus disease-19 virus><design><designing><develop a vaccine><develop vaccines><development of a vaccine><emergent virus><emerging virus><experience><hCoV19><host response><immune system response><immunoresponse><insight><interest><interventional strategy><nCoV2><pathogenic virus><prevent><preventing><programs><pulmonary><receptor><respiratory><respiratory virus><severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV><single molecule><social role><spike proteins on SARS-CoV-2><therapeutic target><tool><trait><vaccine candidate><vaccine development><viral emergence><viral pathogen><virus pathogen>,Biodefense and Related Countermeasures; Coronaviruses; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Prevention; Vaccine Related
Unmasking the roles of viral glycoproteins in oral transmission of KSHV,Unmasking the roles of viral glycoproteins in oral transmission of KSHV,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than 44,000 new cases of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) are reported globally each year, 84% of which occur in
Africa. This and other Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-induced malignancies predominate in
people with acquired or iatrogenic immunodeficiencies. Although KSHV can be detected in other human body
fluids, its frequent detection in saliva in groups both with and without risk of sexually transmitted infections (e.g.,
children) suggests that the oral cavity is the site of primary acquisition. However, the mechanism of KSHV oral
transmission in vivo, particularly the critical viral envelope glycoproteins (gps) required for viral entry,
remains unresolved. Several KSHV–host interactions have been identified, but all prior experiments were
performed in vitro and have not been validated in vivo due to prior lack of an appropriate animal model. Through
collaboration with the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, our laboratory has access to the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, CJ), a recently developed KSHV non-human primate model that is susceptible to
KSHV oral infection, and under immunosuppression acquires KS-like skin lesions. The objective of this
application is to elucidate the minimum gps required to initiate primary oral infection in vivo, as a prerequisite to
selecting key gps for developing an effective prophylactic vaccine candidate. This application builds on Dr.
Ogembo’s recently completed NCI K01 CA184388-05 research on KSHV entry mechanisms and vaccine
development. Recently, we showed that in vitro, the KSHV glycoprotein gH/gL is essential for viral infection of
epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblasts cells, but not B cells. Notably, we and others have also shown that both
monoclonal and polyclonal Abs to KSHV glycoproteins gB, gH/gL, and gpK8.1, can neutralize KSHV infection of
diverse permissive human cells in vitro. Building on this success, we generated KSHV deletion mutants lacking
the four glycoproteins thought to be critical for viral entry (gB, gH/gL, gpK8.1) and various monoclonal antibodies
specific to these gps. In this project, we will use human ex vivo samples and the CJ KSHV model to test the
hypothesis that gB and gH/gL are critical for KSHV in vivo oral transmission. The premise of our proposal is
built on strong evidence that 1) KSHV can infect CJ, which develop KS-like skin lesions, and 2) Abs against the
KSHV glycoproteins gB and gH/gL can neutralize KSHV infection in vitro and ex vivo. Furthermore, the
permissiveness to KSHV infection of human cells ex vivo and CJ makes these platforms ideal to test the KSHV
gp requirements for infection. Successful completion of the proposed study will elucidate the minimum KSHV
gps required for primary infection in ex vivo and in vivo models, advancing our long-term goal of defining the
initial steps in KSHV infection of humans and the role of antibodies in protecting against the early steps of KSHV
transmission. This will ultimately inform design and development of prophylactic vaccines that can prevent KSHV
infection and its associated cancers.",<0-11 years old><AIDS/HIV><Ab-mediated immunity><Ab-mediated protection><Africa><Age><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Antibodies><Antibody immunity><Antibody protection><Antibody-mediated protection><B blood cells><B cell><B cells><B-Cells><B-Lymphocytes><B-cell><Binding><Body Fluids><Buccal Cavity><Buccal Cavity Head and Neck><Callithrix jacchus><Callithrix jacchus jacchus><Cancers><Cavitas Oris><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cell surface><Cells><Child><Child Youth><Children (0-21)><Clinical Treatment Moab><Collaborations><Common Marmoset><Complex><Data><Detection><Development><Disease><Disorder><Endothelial Cells><Endothelium><Epithelial Cells><Epithelium><Fibroblasts><Future><Glycoproteins><Goals><HHV-8><HHV8><HIV/AIDS><Herpes infection><Herpesviridae><Herpesviridae Infections><Herpesviridae disease><Herpesvirus Infections><Herpesviruses><Human><Human Figure><Human Herpesvirus 8><Human body><Iatrogenesis><Immunity><Immunize><Immunocompetent><Immunocompromised><Immunocompromised Host><Immunocompromised Patient><Immunosuppressed Host><Immunosuppression><Immunosuppression Effect><Immunosuppressive Effect><In Vitro><Infection><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><KSHV><Kaposi Sarcoma><Kaposi Sarcoma-Associated Herpes Virus><Kaposi Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus><Kaposi sarcoma associated virus><Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus><Kaposi's Sarcoma><Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus><Laboratories><Lesion><Lymphatic cell><Lymphocyte><Lymphocytic><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Malignant lymphoid neoplasm><Maternal antibody><Measures><Membrane><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular Interaction><Monoclonal Antibodies><Mouth><Multiple Hemorrhagic Sarcoma><Oral><Oral cavity><Pattern><Persons><Predisposition><Preventative vaccine><Preventive vaccine><Primary Infection><Primates><Primates Mammals><Prophylactic vaccine><Receptor Cell><Receptor Protein><Recombinants><Reporting><Research><Risk><Role><Saliva><Sampling><Sexually Transmitted Diseases><Sexually Transmitted Disorder><Sexually Transmitted Infection><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Site><Susceptibility><T-Cells><T-Lymphocyte><Testing><Tonsil><Transmission><Transplant Recipients><Tropism><Venereal Diseases><Venereal Disorders><Venereal Infections><Viral><Viral Diseases><Viremia><Virion><Virus Diseases><Virus Particle><Virus-HHV8><Wisconsin><Work><ages><antibody-mediated immunity><biological signal transduction><cell type><design><designing><develop a vaccine><develop vaccines><development of a vaccine><developmental><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><herpes virus><human model><hypoimmunity><iatrogenic><iatrogenically><iatrogenicity><immune competent><immune deficiency><immune suppression><immune suppressive activity><immune suppressive function><immunodeficiency><immunosuppressed><immunosuppressed patient><immunosuppressive activity><immunosuppressive function><immunosuppressive response><in vivo><in vivo Model><infection mouth><kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus><kaposi's sarcoma-associated human herpesvirus><kids><latent infection><lymph cell><lymphoid cancers><lymphoid malignancy><mAbs><malignancy><membrane structure><model of animal><model of human><monoclonal Abs><mutant><neoplasm/cancer><non-human primate><nonhuman primate><novel><oral infection><oral infectious><permissiveness><polyclonal antibody><polyclonal human antibody><prevent><preventing><prophylactic><receptor><sexually acquired infection><skin lesion><social role><success><thymus derived lymphocyte><tonsillar><tool><transmission process><transplant patient><vaccine candidate><vaccine development><viraemia><viral infection><viral sepsis><virus infection><virus-induced disease><virusemia><youngster>,Biotechnology; Cancer; Clinical Research; Emerging Infectious Diseases; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Rare Diseases
Carbon Nanotube Enabled Delivery of mRNA for an HIV Vaccine Candidate,Carbon Nanotube Enabled Delivery of mRNA for an HIV Vaccine Candidate,"Project Summary
Significant research has gone into the development of a safe and effective vaccine for HIV-1.
Although many strategies have been attempted; none has been successfully established. Even a
partially effective vaccine could decrease the number of people who are infected with HIV, further
reducing the number of people who can pass the virus on to others. By substantially reducing the
number of new infections, we could eventually stop the pandemic. To date, the elicitation of
broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) has proven extremely difficult to achieve which brought
a lot of effort on the novel trimer design and modification. At the same time, it was found that
induced HIV- specific CD8+ T cell responses could limit both the transmission and establishment
of persistent viral reservoirs. All the evidence suggest that no individual factor will determine the
ultimate success of a bNAb-inducing HIV-1 vaccine, which will likely require a combination of
efficient precursor B cell priming, optimization of Env design and presentation, sustained
heterologous Env boosting, a T cell-based strategy, and newly developed delivery systems or
adjuvants. Adjuvants or delivery systems can stimulate different arms of the immune system and
are vital components of subunit vaccines, especially in the case of poorly immunogenic envelope
glycoprotein. Deliver systems can also be designed to address instability of mRNA-based
vaccines. The goal of this program is therefore to overcome challenges with HIV-1 vaccination
and deliver a safe and effective vaccine using a biocompatible, biodegradable, easily
manufactured short carbon nanotube (CNTVac) platform. Env-trimer and mRNA encoding
peptide will be antigens for delivery and will target generation of both humoral and cellular
responses. A humanized mouse model and a non-human primate model will be used for
immunogenicity and efficacy studies. As the novel non-viral gene transfer vector for HIV-1 vaccine
delivery, we will establish methodology for potential GMP production and generate safety profiles
under FDA requirements.","<ADME Study><AIDS Virus><Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Study><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Address><Adjuvant><Affinity><Antibodies><Antigen Variation><Antigenic Determinants><Antigenic Variability><Antigenic Variation><Antigens><B blood cells><B cell><B cells><B-Cells><B-Lymphocytes><B-cell><Binding><Binding Determinants><Biotech><Biotechnology><Buckytubes><CD8><CD8 Cell><CD8 T cells><CD8 lymphocyte><CD8+ T cell><CD8+ T-Lymphocyte><CD8-Positive Lymphocytes><CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes><CD8B><CD8B1><CD8B1 gene><Carbon Nanotubes><Carbon nano tubes><Certification><Chemistry><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Collaborations><Development><Ensure><Epitopes><Formulation><Generations><Glycans><Glycoproteins><Goals><HIV><HIV resistance><HIV resistant><HIV vaccine><HIV-1><HIV-1 vaccine><HIV-I><HIV/AIDS Vaccines><HIV1><HIV1 vaccine><Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human immunodeficiency virus 1><Immune response><Immune system><Immunological response><In Vitro><Individual><Infection><Injectable><Injections><Intramuscular><LAV-HTLV-III><LYT3><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><M mulatta><M. mulatta><Macaca mulatta><Mediating><Messenger RNA><Methodology><Methods><Modeling><Modification><Molecular Configuration><Molecular Conformation><Molecular Interaction><Molecular Stereochemistry><Peptides><Persons><Phase><Physiologic><Physiological><Polysaccharides><Pre IND FDA meeting><Pre-IND mtg><Process><Production><RNA vaccine><RNA-based vaccine><Radiolabeled><Recombinants><Research><Retroviridae><Retroviruses><Rhesus Macaque><Rhesus Monkey><Safety><Specific qualifier value><Specified><Structure><Subunit Vaccines><Surface><Synthetic Antigens><System><T cell response><T-Cells><T-Lymphocyte><T8 Cells><T8 Lymphocytes><Technology><Testing><Time><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Translations><Transmission><Universities><Vaccination><Vaccines><Validation><Viral reservoir><Virus><Virus reservoir><Virus-HIV><Virus-Retrovirus><Work><analytical method><arm><biocompatibility><biomaterial compatibility><clinical translation><clinically translatable><commercial scale manufacturing><conformation><conformational><conformational state><conformationally><conformations><cost><cost effective><deliver mRNA><deliver messenger RNA><deliver vaccines><delivery system for mRNA><design><designing><develop a vaccine><develop vaccines><development of a vaccine><developmental><discover vaccines><efficacy study><gang><gene transfer vector><host response><human immunodeficiency virus vaccine><humanized mice><humanized mouse><immune system response><immunogen><immunogenic><immunogenicity><immunoresponse><in vivo><lipid based nanoparticle><lipid nanoparticle><mRNA><mRNA Instability><mRNA delivery><mRNA vaccine><mRNA-based vaccine><manufacture><manufacturing process><manufacturing ramp-up><manufacturing scale-up><messenger RNA delivery><mouse model><murine model><nano vaccine><nanovaccine><neutralizing antibody><non-human primate><nonhuman primate><novel><pandemic><pandemic disease><pre-IND consultation><pre-IND discussion><pre-IND meeting><pre-Investigational New Drug meeting><pre-clinical study><preclinical study><predict responsiveness><predicting response><preservation><programs><radiolabeling><radiologically labeled><response><scale up><scale up batch><scale up production><success><thymus derived lymphocyte><translation><transmission process><upscale manufacturing><vaccine candidate><vaccine delivery><vaccine development><vaccine discovery><vaccine formulation><vaccine platform><validations>",Bioengineering; Biotechnology; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Mental Health; Nanotechnology; Prevention; Vaccine Related
Characterization of iGL-VRC01 Memory B cell Responses in Mice,Characterization of iGL-VRC01 Memory B cell Responses in Mice,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The behavior of B cell memory in mice and humans is an active area of research with implications for
traditional vaccine design and for the development of our engineered B cell vaccine (parent award). There
is data in mice supporting the idea that memory B cells have a very limited ability to re-enter germinal
centers. Alternatively, it has been shown that di?erent memory phenotypes exist with some showing a
preference for germinal center re-entry. We hypothesize that memory behavior, similar to naive cell
behavior, may also depend on immunogen a?inity, valency, and availability of T cell help. We will explore
these ideas by generating various memory phenotypes using in vitro B cell activation and adoptive transfer
to increase the frequency of antigen-speciﬁc memory in the B6 mouse model (which is normally very low).
We will then vaccinate using antigens with deﬁned a?inities and valency’s to see if these factors impact
memory cell developmental fates. We would also like to immunize memory at di?erent times to see if
changing memory B cell surface markers are associated with altered cell behaviors in response to
vaccination.",<Acute B-Lymphocytic Leukemia><Adoptive Transfer><Affinity><Animals><Antigens><Area><B blood cells><B cell><B cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia><B cell receptor><B cells><B-ALL><B-Cell  Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia><B-Cell Activation><B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia><B-Cell Antigen Receptor><B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia><B-Cell Subsets><B-Cells><B-Lymphocyte Subsets><B-Lymphocytes><B-cell><B-cell ALL><B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia><Behavior><CD154><CD40L><CD40LG><Cell Body><Cell Compartmentation><Cell Compartmentations><Cell surface><Cells><Clonal Expansion><Complement><Complement Proteins><Data><Development><Engineering><Engraftment><Frequencies><Germinal Center><Goals><HIV Receptors><HTLV-III Receptors><Human><Immunize><In Vitro><Infection><KI mice><Knock-in><Knock-in Mouse><Memory><Memory B Cell><Memory B-Lymphocyte><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Murine><Mus><Parents><Phenotype><Pre-B-Cell Leukemia><Precursor B Lymphoblastic Leukemia><Reaction><Research><Secondary to><Shapes><Structure of germinal center of lymph node><T-Cells><T-Lymphocyte><TNFSF5><TNFSF5 gene><TRAP Gene><Testing><Vaccinated><Vaccination><Vaccine Design><Vaccines><Work><activated B cells><cell behavior><cellular behavior><complementation><developmental><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><immunization strategy><immunogen><improved><knockin><knockin mice><mouse model><murine model><neutralizing antibody><parent><parent award><parent project><preference><programs><response><success><thymus derived lymphocyte><vaccination strategy>,HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Immunotherapy; Prevention; Vaccine Related; Vaccine Related - AIDS
Kupewa: Optimizing strategies to implement provider recommendation of HPV vaccination for adolescent girls and young women with HIV in Malawi,Kupewa: Optimizing strategies to implement provider recommendation of HPV vaccination for adolescent girls and young women with HIV in Malawi,"Project Summary/Abstract
Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is a critical cancer control intervention, particularly in resource-
constrained health systems with limited access to screening and treatment services. Malawi, like many African
countries, has introduced a national HPV vaccine program targeting preadolescent girls – but coverage remains
very low. Clinician recommendation of HPV vaccination is a highly effective evidence-based intervention for
increasing uptake of the vaccine, but there is little information on how to encourage clinicians in low- and middle-
income countries to deliver this recommendation.
The Kupewa project (“prevent” in Chichewa) aims to (A) identify the optimal implementation strategies for
increasing clinician recommendation of HPV vaccination for girls and young women aged 9-24 who are living
with HIV in Malawi; (B) refine this set of optimized strategies by including information about the strategies’
implementability; and (C) ultimately identify the set of strategies that are effective, implementable, and show
sustained effects 18 months after the intervention ends. The study is informed by the Theoretical Domains
Framework and the World Health Organization’s Behavioural and Social Drivers (BeSD) of vaccination
framework.
To our knowledge, this would be among the first applications of intervention optimization alongside
implementation science, and among the first to be conducted in a low-income country. The project will leverage
a robust research partnership between institutions and highly-qualified investigators in Malawi and the U.S., with
engagement of partners from the Malawi Ministry of Health in all phases, from conceptualization to study
execution and results interpretation and dissemination.
Clinician-facing implementation strategies to promote vaccination recommendation in low- and middle-income
countries are understudied but urgently needed to accelerate HPV vaccination programs globally. This study will
provide much-needed insight into ways to promote clinician recommendation of HPV vaccination to the highest-
risk girls and young women in the country with the second-highest burden of cervical cancer globally.",<AIDS Virus><Acceleration><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Adoption><Affect><African><Age><Attention><Behavioral><Cancer Burden><Cancer Control><Cancer Control Science><Caring><Cervical Cancer><Cervix Cancer><Cessation of life><Clinical><Cost Measures><Cost metrics><Country><Death><Decision Making><Dose><Drug Prescribing><Drug Prescriptions><Eastern Africa><Economic Income><Economical Income><Effectiveness><Eligibility><Eligibility Determination><Evidence based intervention><Experimental Designs><Female Adolescents><Focus Groups><HIV><HPV Vaccination><HPV Vaccine><HPV vaccination acceptability><HPV vaccination acceptance><HPV vaccination confidence><HPV vaccination uptake><HPV vaccine acceptability><HPV vaccine acceptance><HPV vaccine confidence><HPV vaccine uptake><Health><Health Care Providers><Health Facilities><Health Personnel><Health care facility><Health system><Healthcare Facility><Healthcare Providers><Healthcare worker><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination><Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine><Human Papillomavirus Vaccination><Human papillomavirus Vaccine><Immunization Programs><Incidence><Income><Institution><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Investigators><Knowledge><LAV-HTLV-III><LMIC><Life><Low-resource area><Low-resource community><Low-resource environment><Low-resource region><Low-resource setting><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Malawi><Malignant Cervical Neoplasm><Malignant Cervical Tumor><Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix><Malignant Tumor of the Cervix><Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri><Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm><Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor><Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri><Measures><Medical Records><Memory><National Cancer Burden><Nurses><Nyasaland><Parents><Performance><Phase><Policies><Process><Protocol Screening><Provider><Qualifying><Randomized><Recommendation><Research><Research Personnel><Research Resources><Researchers><Resource-constrained area><Resource-constrained community><Resource-constrained environment><Resource-constrained region><Resource-constrained setting><Resource-limited area><Resource-limited community><Resource-limited environment><Resource-limited region><Resource-limited setting><Resource-poor area><Resource-poor community><Resource-poor environment><Resource-poor region><Resource-poor setting><Resources><Site><Subgroup><Survey Instrument><Surveys><System><Testing><Theoretical Domains framework><Time><Training><Update><Uterine Cervix Cancer><Vaccination><Vaccination Programs><Virus-HIV><Visit><Woman><Work><World Health Organization><accept HPV vaccination><accept HPV vaccine><accept human papilloma virus vaccination><accept human papilloma virus vaccine><accept vaccination><accept vaccine><adolescent girl><adoption by clinician><adoption by healthcare providers><adoption by physician><adoption by provider><aged><ages><care facilities><clinician adoption><cost><cost measurement><design><designing><develop therapy><disparity in health><fighting><girls><global health><health care personnel><health care worker><health disparity><health provider><health workforce><healthcare personnel><hesitant to vaccination><high risk><human papilloma virus vaccination acceptability><human papilloma virus vaccination acceptance><human papilloma virus vaccination confidence><human papilloma virus vaccination uptake><human papilloma virus vaccine acceptability><human papilloma virus vaccine acceptance><human papilloma virus vaccine confidence><human papilloma virus vaccine uptake><implementation cost><implementation investment><implementation science><implementation strategy><improved><incomes><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><intervention design><intervention development><interventional strategy><low and middle-income countries><low income country><medical personnel><medication prescription><multidisciplinary><multiphase optimization strategy><nurse><parent><physician adoption><pilot test><pre-adolescent><preadolescence><prescribed medication><preteen><prevent><preventing><primary outcome><programs><provider adoption><provider-level adoption><public health relevance><randomisation><randomization><randomly assigned><scale up><screening services><secondary outcome><skills><social><strategies for implementation><therapy design><therapy development><translational framework><treatment design><treatment development><treatment provider><treatment services><uptake><vaccination acceptability><vaccination acceptance><vaccination confidence><vaccination hesitancy><vaccination uptake><vaccination willingness><vaccine acceptability><vaccine acceptance><vaccine confidence><vaccine hesitancy><vaccine hesitant><vaccine uptake><vaccine willingness><young woman>,Behavioral and Social Science;

Leveraging HIV infrastructure to implement cervical cancer prevention: A study to integrate HPV vaccination in adolescent HIV clinics in Zambia,Leveraging HIV infrastructure to implement cervical cancer prevention: A study to integrate HPV vaccination in adolescent HIV clinics in Zambia,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Zambia, where HIV prevalence is also high (11.3%).
HIV heightens the risk of developing and dying from cervical cancer. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine
is a WHO-endorsed, evidence-based tool that can prevent 90% of cervical cancers, and is recommended for
girls ages 9-14. However, HPV vaccine coverage is low (16%) in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs),
and our team's on-the-ground experience suggests HPV vaccination is even lower in Zambia, particularly
among girls with HIV, who are most at risk of poor cancer outcomes. Currently, HPV vaccination is
delivered via school-based campaigns, which are viewed as efficient for broad coverage but also exclude the
most vulnerable children—those out-of-school or who irregularly attend (e.g., orphans, poor). Adolescents
living with HIV (ALHIV) are more likely to have these additional vulnerabilities. In addition, WHO recommends
ALHIV receive a 3rd dose of the HPV vaccine, which is not given in traditional 2-dose school-based campaigns.
To ensure that ALHIV have access to the WHO-recommended 3-doses, we propose to integrate HPV
vaccination into routine care in adolescent HIV clinics. Adolescent HIV clinics in Zambia have regular
contact with ALHIV and are trusted sources of health information for the community. Given the known
challenges of providing cervical cancer prevention in LMICs, including Zambia (e.g., stigma, misinformation,
staffing, supply chain), integrating HPV vaccination requires a multilevel approach, stakeholder
engagement, and diversified implementation strategies. To achieve success, we will co-design a package
of implementation strategies using a previously successful implementation research approach developed for
cervical cancer prevention in LMICs: the Integrative Systems Praxis for Implementation Research (INSPIRE).
INSPIRE is a novel, formal, and comprehensive framework to develop, implement, and evaluate
implementation science efforts. Following key elements of INSPIRE, our specific aims are to: 1) Identify the
unique multilevel contextual factors (barriers and facilitators) across HIV settings (rural, urban, peri-urban) that
influence HPV vaccine uptake; 2) Use Implementation Mapping to translate stakeholder feedback and findings
from Aim 1 into a package of implementation strategies to integrate HPV vaccine into HIV clinics; 3) Conduct a
Hybrid Type 3 effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate the package of multilevel implementation
strategies for integrating HPV vaccine into HIV clinics. Our research team has significant expertise in HIV,
HPV, cancer prevention, implementation science, and LMIC research. Wehave strong institutional backing,
including$325,000 over the course of the study;strong support, technical expertise, and resources (e.g.,
vaccines) from the Zambian Ministry of Health; and political will for scale-up. If successful, this
stakeholder-based implementation model could be transported to HIV clinics across Zambia and serve as a
model to address cancer prevention priorities for those with HIV in other LMICs.","<0-11 years old><12-20 years old><AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Address><Adolescence><Adolescent><Adolescent HIV><Adolescent Youth><African><Age><Application Context><Assess implementation><Cancer Burden><Cancer Cause><Cancer Etiology><Cancers><Cervical Cancer><Cervix Cancer><Cessation of life><Child><Child Youth><Children (0-21)><Clinic><Clinical><Communities><Country><Death><Development><Dose><Education><Educational aspects><Educational workshop><Elements><Ethnography><Evidence based intervention><Exclusion><Exposure to><Feedback><Friends><HIV><HIV infection in adolescence><HIV infections in adolescents><HIV-infected (HIV+) adolescents><HIV-infected adolescents><HPV><HPV Vaccination><HPV Vaccine><HPV infection><HPV vaccination acceptability><HPV vaccination acceptance><HPV vaccination confidence><HPV vaccination uptake><HPV vaccine acceptability><HPV vaccine acceptance><HPV vaccine confidence><HPV vaccine uptake><Health><Health Services><Household><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human Papilloma Virus><Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination><Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine><Human Papillomavirus><Human Papillomavirus Vaccination><Human papilloma virus infection><Human papillomavirus Vaccine><Human papillomavirus infection><Hybrids><Implementation assessment><Inequity><Infectious Human Wart Virus><Infrastructure><Institution><Intention><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Interview><LAV-HTLV-III><LMIC><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Malignant Cervical Neoplasm><Malignant Cervical Tumor><Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Malignant Tumor of the Cervix><Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri><Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm><Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor><Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri><Maps><Methods><Misinformation><Modeling><National Cancer Burden><Northern Rhodesia><Orphan><Outcome><Persons><Politics><Population><Prevalence><Process><RE-AIM><Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance><Recommendation><Research><Research Resources><Resources><Risk><Rural><Schedule><Schools><Services><Sex Behavior><Sexual Activity><Sexual Behavior><Site><Source><Southern Africa><Strategic Planning><System><Technical Expertise><Testing><Thinking><Translating><Trust><Uterine Cervix Cancer><Vaccination><Vaccines><Virus-HIV><Vulnerable Populations><Woman><Women's mortality><Workshop><Zambia><accept HPV vaccination><accept HPV vaccine><accept human papilloma virus vaccination><accept human papilloma virus vaccine><acceptability and feasibility><access to vaccination><access to vaccines><adolescence (12-20)><adolescents living with HIV><adolescents with HIV><ages><cancer prevention><cancer risk><cervical cancer prevention><clinical care><clinical infrastructure><contextual factors><death among females><death among women><death in females><death in women><death rate among women><death rate in women><design><designing><developmental><effectiveness and implementation trial><effectiveness/implementation hybrid trial><effectiveness/implementation trial><ethnographic><evaluate implementation><evaluation of implementation><evidence base><experience><female death><female mortality><girls><high risk><high risk group><high risk individual><high risk people><high risk population><human papilloma virus vaccination acceptability><human papilloma virus vaccination acceptance><human papilloma virus vaccination confidence><human papilloma virus vaccination uptake><human papilloma virus vaccine acceptability><human papilloma virus vaccine acceptance><human papilloma virus vaccine confidence><human papilloma virus vaccine uptake><implementation design><implementation evaluation><implementation outcomes><implementation research><implementation research design><implementation science><implementation strategy><informant><interventional strategy><juvenile><juvenile human><kids><low and middle-income countries><malignancy><mortality among females><mortality among women><mortality in females><mortality in women><neoplasm/cancer><novel><peri-urban><periurban><prevent><preventing><reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance><routine care><scale up><sex activity><sexual activities><social stigma><stigma><strategies for implementation><success><supply chain><technical skills><thoughts><tool><vaccination access><vaccination availability><vaccine access><vaccine availability><vulnerable adolescent><vulnerable group><vulnerable individual><vulnerable people><wart virus><women's death><women's death rate><youngster>",Behavioral and Social Science;

Engaging communities to develop and evaluate communication strategies for HIV vaccine and prevention uptake among Black women in the Southern US,Engaging communities to develop and evaluate communication strategies for HIV vaccine and prevention uptake among Black women in the Southern US,"Project Summary
This proposal addresses NIMH’s call for HIV vaccine preparedness and “HIV vaccine-related” communication
research (Notice of Special Interest NOT-MH-21-105). Though vaccines may be years away, the NOSI
recognizes that the time to conduct rigorous HIV vaccine communication research is now – to advance the
basic science of effective HIV vaccine messaging and get ahead of misinformation.
HIV disproportionately impacts young Black women living in the Southern US. Black women make up 13% of
the female population in the US, yet make up 54% of new HIV infections among women in the US. These
disparities are most extreme in the South, where black women account for 72% of new HIV infections among
women. These data highlight the urgent need to develop and scale-up biomedical HIV prevention strategies
centered on the unique needs of Black women in the South. Herein, we propose to develop and test a multi-
component communications intervention to promote uptake of a future HIV vaccine, as part of a
comprehensive set of strategies for HIV prevention, among Black women ages 18–34 in the South. Our
diverse team of HIV clinicians, behavioral scientists and health communication experts includes faculty from
Texas Southern University, the 2nd largest Historically Black College and University (HBCU) in the US. This
five-year study will take place in Houston, Texas, an epicenter of the HIV epidemic in the US South. We will
use community based participatory research methods (CBPR) and Community Engagement Studios to engage
young Black women in co-creating and testing communication content across multiple components (i.e., words,
graphics, videos). To increase uptake of a future HIV vaccine, we will conduct the following aims: 1) Assess
barriers and facilitators to uptake of a future HIV vaccine within the larger family of biomedical HIV prevention
tools, 2) Co-create theory-based message features (i.e., strategic word choice/ framing), graphics, and short
videos (30-120 seconds) for uptake of a future HIV vaccine. Theory-based features include enhanced active
choice, protective agency assignment, autonomy restoration, anticipated affect. 3) Evaluate the effect of
different theory-based message features, graphics and videos on HIV vaccine and prevention intention. We will
evaluate effects in three separate randomized trials of young Black women. This proposal takes a rigorous
approach to understanding the basic behavioral science of HIV vaccine communication. Communications
research is needed to understand how to develop messages that address distinct barriers to seeking out HIV
prevention (i.e., stigma, discrimination, medical mistrust, low risk perception, lack of awareness or knowledge)
and at the same time, leverage personal and social factors that resonate with Black women (e.g., social
networks, peer structures, and images and narratives that tap into the lived experiences of Black women). If
successful, this model of message design may translate to other long-acting forms of HIV prevention in
development (e.g. once a year implants, injectables, and broadly neutralizing antibody infusions).",<2019-nCoV vaccine><AIDS Virus><AIDS prevention><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Address><Adoption><Affect><Age><Area><Attitude><Awareness><Basic Behavioral Science><Basic Research><Basic Science><Behavioral><Behavioral Sciences><Belief><Black><Black race><COVID-19 vaccine><Characteristics><Cognitive Discrimination><Communication><Communication Research><Communities><Data><Decrease disparity><Development><Discrimination><Disparities><Disparity><Epidemic><Faculty><Family><Female><Future><Gender><Generations><HBCUs><HIV><HIV Infections><HIV Prevention><HIV vaccine><HIV/AIDS Vaccines><HIV/AIDS prevention><HTLV-III Infections><HTLV-III-LAV Infections><Historically Black Colleges><Historically Black Colleges and Universities><Historically Black Institution><Historically Black University><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections><Image><Implant><Infusion><Infusion procedures><Injectable><Intention><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Interview><Investigators><Knowledge><LAV-HTLV-III><Lived experience><Lived experiences><Lower disparity><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Marketing><Medical><Misinformation><Modeling><NIMH><National Institute of Mental Health><Population><PrEP><Preparedness><Preventative strategy><Prevention><Prevention strategy><Preventive strategy><Protective Agents><Protective Drugs><Provider><Randomization trial><Readiness><Recommendation><Research><Research Methodology><Research Methods><Research Personnel><Researchers><SARS-CoV-2 vaccine><SARS-coronavirus-2 vaccine><Science><Scientist><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 vaccine><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine><Social Network><Stereotyping><Structure><Study models><Testing><Texas><Time><Translating><United States><Universities><Vaccines><Virus-HIV><Woman><Work><accept vaccination><accept vaccine><adult youth><ages><black female><black women><community based participatory research><community engagement><community led research><community participatory research><community partnered participatory research><coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine><coronavirus disease-19 vaccine><design><designing><developmental><disparity reduction><distrust><engagement with communities><health communication><human immunodeficiency virus vaccine><imaging><infusions><innovate><innovation><innovative><interest><interventional strategy><mitigate disparity><nCoV vaccine><nCoV-19 vaccine><nCoV19 vaccine><neutralizing antibody><outreach><participatory action research><peer><pre-exposure prophylaxis><randomized trial><reduce disparity><reduction in disparity><research and methods><restoration><risk perception><scale up><social factors><social stigma><stigma><theories><tool><uptake><vaccination acceptability><vaccination acceptance><vaccination confidence><vaccination study><vaccination trial><vaccination uptake><vaccination willingness><vaccine acceptability><vaccine acceptance><vaccine against 2019-nCov><vaccine against COVID-19><vaccine against SARS-CoV-2><vaccine against SARS-coronavirus-2><vaccine against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2><vaccine against Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2><vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2><vaccine confidence><vaccine efficacy><vaccine for novel coronavirus><vaccine study><vaccine trial><vaccine uptake><vaccine willingness><vaccines preventing COVID><vaccines to prevent COVID><young adult><young adulthood><young woman>,Behavioral and Social Science; Biotechnology; Clinical Research; HIV/AIDS; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Mental Health; Pediatric; Pediatric - AIDS; Prevention; Racial and Ethnic Minority Health Research; Social Determinants of Health; Vaccine Related; Women's Health Research
LOC:  HIV Vaccine Trials Network,LOC:  HIV Vaccine Trials Network,"This proposal outlines the scientific agenda of the Leadership and Operations Center of the HIV Vaccine Trials
Network (HVTN), the collaboration of physician scientists at 64 clinical trial sites in 15 countries on 4 continents
dedicated to developing a globally effective HIV vaccine. During the current funding period, the HVTN has
transformed HIV prevention science by taking two HIV vaccine concepts and the broadly neutralizing monoclonal
antibody (mAb) VRC01 from phase 1 to efficacy evaluation. We have added over 35 clinical trial sites in sub-
Saharan Africa and now have over 12,500 participants enrolled in randomized controlled efficacy trials.
We propose to continue our scientific leadership in HIV vaccines. The scientific pipeline for vaccines with the
potential to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to HIV has markedly expanded. This proposal
describes a novel fast-track phase 1 program to assess, in an iterative fashion, candidate trimers, germline or
lineage-based vaccines designed to elicit bnAbs in adults. A phase 1 program to investigate these vaccines in
HIV-1–exposed infants is also proposed. The HVTN currently has five HIV efficacy trials in place. Two vaccine
trials (HVTN 702 & 705) are in progress; a third (HVTN 706) will start in August 2019; and we are collaborating
with the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) on two antibody-mediated prevention (AMP) trials evaluating the
infusion of passively administered mAbs. These efficacy trials will define the potential of neutralizing and/or non-
neutralizing antibodies to prevent HIV acquisition. The samples and statistical design of the efficacy trials are
developed around correlates of protection; we will continue to develop the robust integrated laboratory, statistical
and computational platform needed to define these correlates. We will also continue to expand our behavioral
sciences program to enhance our already successful recruitment and retention programs, and to continue to
expand the enrollment of persons of color and transgender persons into HVTN trials.
Vaccine clinical trials involve a complex interplay between clinical trial sites, HVTN laboratories, computational
scientists, and our operational, training, mentoring, and fiscal management teams; these interactions are
described in the application. The clinical, laboratory and statistical infrastructure we have built for HIV vaccines
will also be used to assist in tuberculosis (TB) vaccine development. Importantly, we will build on our success in
the unique community-based programs and integration of community representatives and community advisory
boards into HVTN research process and conduct. We will also continue to develop the next generation of vaccine
scientists and expand our scientific collaborations to engage the scientific community to utilize the extensive
specimen and data repositories we have established. The overall goal of the HVTN in this proposal is to develop
a vaccine regimen or combination mAb regimen that will reduce HIV acquisition in adults and infants by more
than 60 percent.",<0-11 years old><21+ years old><AIDS Virus><AIDS prevention><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Adult><Adult Human><Africa South of the Sahara><Antibodies><Behavioral Sciences><Biological Specimen Banks><Biological Substance Banks><Child><Child Youth><Children (0-21)><Clinical><Clinical Treatment Moab><Clinical Trials><Collaborations><Communities><Complex><Country><Data Banks><Databanks><Dedications><Effectiveness><Enrollment><Funding><Germ Lines><Goals><HIV><HIV Prevention><HIV Vaccine Trials Network><HIV prevention trials network><HIV vaccine><HIV-1><HIV-I><HIV/AIDS Vaccines><HIV/AIDS prevention><HIV1><HVTN><Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human immunodeficiency virus 1><Infant><Infection><Infection prevention><Infrastructure><Infusion><Infusion procedures><Injections><LAV-HTLV-III><Laboratories><Leadership><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><MTB vaccine><Mediating><Mentors><Monoclonal Antibodies><Persons><Phase><Physicians><Prevent infection><Prevention trial><Process><Randomized><Regimen><Research><Sampling><Science><Scientist><Site><Sub-Saharan Africa><Subsaharan Africa><TB vaccine><Training><Transmission><Tuberculosis Vaccines><Vaccine Clinical Trial><Vaccine Design><Vaccine for TB><Vaccine for Tuberculosis><Vaccines><Virus-HIV><adulthood><anti-TB vaccine><antiretroviral therapy><antiretroviral treatment><biological specimen repository><biosample repository><biospecimen bank><biospecimen repository><community advisory board><community advisory committee><community advisory panel><computational platform><computing platform><data depository><data repository><data set repository><dataset repository><design><designing><determine efficacy><develop a vaccine><develop vaccines><development of a vaccine><efficacy analysis><efficacy assessment><efficacy determination><efficacy evaluation><efficacy examination><efficacy trial><enroll><evaluate efficacy><examine efficacy><group of color><human immunodeficiency virus vaccine><individual of color><infant infection><infected infant><infusions><kids><mAbs><monoclonal Abs><neutralizing antibody><neutralizing mAb><neutralizing monoclonal antibodies><new vaccines><next generation vaccines><novel><novel vaccines><operation><operations><pandemic><pandemic disease><participant enrollment><patient enrollment><people of color><person of color><population based><population of color><prevent><preventing><programs><randomisation><randomization><randomly assigned><recruit><specimen bank><specimen repository><success><trans*><transgender><transmission process><vaccination study><vaccination trial><vaccine against M. tuberculosis><vaccine against Mtb><vaccine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis><vaccine against TB><vaccine against tuberculosis><vaccine antibodies><vaccine candidate><vaccine candidates against tuberculosis><vaccine development><vaccine induced antibodies><vaccine study><vaccine trial><vaccine-induced antibodies><youngster>,Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Pediatric; Pediatric - AIDS; Prevention; Vaccine Related; Vaccine Related - AIDS
Innate immune response of LTBI+HIV+ children,Innate immune response of LTBI+HIV+ children,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infects one-third of the world’s population and causes almost 1.3 million
deaths per year, including 100, 000 children. Approximately 90% of infected persons have latent tuberculosis
infection (LTBI), have protective immunity and remain well, but 10% develop primary tuberculosis (TB) soon
after infection or reactivation TB many years later. Children are more susceptible to TB infection, due to an
immature immune system. HIV infection in children markedly increases susceptibility to TB, and HIV-infected
persons with LTBI have an 800-fold greater risk of developing active TB (www.cdc.gov/tb/). TB is the leading
cause of death in HIV-infected persons and more than half a million coinfected people die annually. To develop
adequate prophylaxis or therapy, it is important to understand immune responses to Mtb. Identification of HIV+
children with LTBI who are at greatly increased risk for development of TB would allow treating only high-risk
children, facilitating completion of therapy for LTBI and preventing future development of TB. To identify these
children, it is important to pinpoint the nature of the defective immune responses that permit development of
active TB in HIV+LTBI+ pediatric patients.
 Over the past 18 years, we have published a series of articles demonstrating that human NK cells have
the potential to contribute to both innate and adaptive immune responses to Mtb. Our recently published
studies demonstrate that memory-like NK cells contribute to vaccine-induced protective immunity against Mtb
and IL-21 is required for expansion of memory-like NK cells in both humans and mice. Based on our
published studies, we hypothesize that HIV-LTBI+ children household contacts have defective
memory-like NK cell expansion compared to HIV-LTBI+ adult household contacts and these defects are
more severe in HIV+ LTBI+ children. The proposed studies in the current application will be performed in
India as a part of RePORT-India consortium. This study will leverage the large Indo-US investment and TB/HIV
research consortium of RePORT-India which has developed cohorts of TB cases and household contacts in
India and has paired Indian investigators with US investigators at 6 sites. Already collected samples will be
used for the proposed studies in aim 1. Our specific aims are: 1. Determine Mtb specific memory-like NK cell
responses of children in a large group of household contacts of TB patients. 2.Compare the memory-like NK
cell responses of HIV+ and HIV- children with LTBI. 3. Determine whether KIR haplotypes and HLA
polymorphism is associated with expansion of memory-like NK cells in children.",<0-11 years old><21+ years old><AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Adult><Adult Human><Age><Antitubercular Agents><Blood Sample><Blood monocyte><Blood specimen><CD25><CD8 Cell><CD8 T cells><CD8 lymphocyte><CD8+ T cell><CD8+ T-Lymphocyte><CD8-Positive Lymphocytes><CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes><Cause of Death><Cell Body><Cell Mediated Immunology><Cell-Mediated Immunity><Cells><Cellular Immunity><Cessation of life><Chemotactic Cytokines><Child><Child Youth><Children (0-21)><Cytotoxic cell><Death><Defect><Development><FOXP3><FOXP3 gene><Family><Forkhead Box P3><Future><Generalized Growth><Genetic Polymorphism><Growth><HAART><HIV><HIV Infections><HIV/Mtb><HIV/TB><HIV/mycobacterium tuberculosis><HIV/tuberculosis><HTLV-III Infections><HTLV-III-LAV Infections><Haplotypes><Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy><Homologous Chemotactic Cytokines><Household><Human><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections><IL-21 receptor><IL21><IL21R><IL2R><IL2RA><IL2RA gene><Immune><Immune Globulins><Immune response><Immune system><Immunes><Immunity><Immunoglobulins><Immunological response><India><Individual><Infection><Innate Immune Response><Intercrines><Investigators><Investments><JM2><K Cells><K lymphocyte><Killer Cells><LAV-HTLV-III><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><M tb><M tuberculosis><M tuberculosis infection><M. tb><M. tb infection><M. tuberculosis><M. tuberculosis infection><M. tuberculosis/HIV><M.tb infection><M.tuberculosis infection><MTB infection><MTB vaccine><Macrophage><Marrow monocyte><Measures><Mediating><Memory><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Murine><Mus><Mycobacterium tuberculosis><Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection><Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection><Mφ><NK Cells><Natural Killer Cells><Nature><Patients><Persons><Phenotype><Play><Population><Predisposition><Production><Prophylactic treatment><Prophylaxis><Publishing><Receptor Protein><Reporting><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Resistance><Response Latencies><Risk><Role><SCURFIN><SIS cytokines><Sampling><Series><Site><Susceptibility><T cell response><T8 Cells><T8 Lymphocytes><TB immunity><TB infection><TB vaccine><TCGFR><Time><Tissue Growth><Tuberculosis><Tuberculosis Vaccines><Tuberculostatic Agents><Vaccine for TB><Vaccine for Tuberculosis><Vaccines><Virus-HIV><adaptive immune response><adulthood><ages><anti-TB><anti-TB vaccine><anti-tuberculosis><antiTB><cell mediated immune response><chemoattractant cytokine><chemokine><child patients><cohort><cytokine><developmental><disseminated TB><disseminated tuberculosis><high risk><host response><immune system response><immunity against M. tuberculosis><immunity against Mtb><immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis><immunity against TB><immunity against tuberculosis><immunity in tuberculosis><immunity to TB><immunity to tuberculosis><immunoresponse><individual response><individualized response><infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis><interleukin-21><interleukin-21 receptor><kids><monocyte><mtb><novel><ontogeny><pediatric patients><polymorphism><prevent><preventing><progression risk><receptor><resistant><response><social role><tuberculosis immunity><tuberculosis infection><tuberculous spondyloarthropathy><vaccine against M. tuberculosis><vaccine against Mtb><vaccine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis><vaccine against TB><vaccine against tuberculosis><vaccine candidates against tuberculosis><youngster>,Biodefense and Related Countermeasures; Clinical Research; Emerging Infectious Diseases; HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Pediatric; Pediatric - AIDS; Rare Diseases; Tuberculosis
B Cell Bioinformatic Supplement: HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN),B Cell Bioinformatic Supplement: HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN),"Project Abstract
Project Title: B-Cell Bioinformatics and Analytics for the HVTN Discovery Medicine Program
This proposal outlines the scientific agenda for the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) Statistical and
Data Management Center (SDMC) to expand our capacity in carrying out B-cell bioinformatics and
analytics work. This effort is aimed at supporting the increasing demands of the rapidly growing HVTN
Discovery Medicine Program which is poised to evaluate more than 15 protocols in the current HVTN
grant cycle.
Given the promising outcome of several broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb)-inducing vaccine
immunogens which have demonstrated initial success in eliciting tier 2 heterologous neutralization
antibodies and expanding HIV-1 bnAb precursors, we recognize that it is strategically crucial to evaluate
additional vaccine candidates. These candidates should pair prime and boosting immunogens carefully
selected to optimally mature B-cell responses towards broad neutralization against HIV. To accomplish
this, it is imperative to evaluate and down-select immunogens using assays that provide both cellular-
and molecular-level information about evolution of vaccine-induced B-cell repertoires. Addressing these
needs necessitates the establishment of robust and standardized computational and analytical pipelines
adapted to interrogate B-cell phenotyping (BCP) and B-cell receptor (BCR) sequencing data.
The HVTN SDMC has made significant progress since 2020 in developing various aspects of the
computational and analytical pipeline that supports its Discovery Medicine Program. However, the
SDMC’s funding has become insufficient to meet the critical strategic requirements of the program,
particularly those needed to expedite the generation of reports and datasets summarizing BCP and BCR
sequencing data to vaccine developers. These reports are critical to accelerate the design and down-
selection of boost immunogens required to continue guiding affinity maturation of vaccine-induced B-
cells toward neutralization against HIV. These reports are also central to quickly guiding programmatic
decisions from the HVTN and NIAID leaderships. This funding shortfall is primarily attributed to the
escalating complexity of research studies, the iterative nature of immunogen designs, the increased
number of studies in the pipeline, and the expectation that summaries and interpretation of these
complex laboratory data should be distributed quickly. Consequently, the HVTN SDMC is seeking
supplemental funding for Fiscal Years (FY) 2024 through 2027 to bolster the success of the HVTN

Induction of an effective HIV-1 vaccine is a global priority; yet, no HIV-1 vaccine regimen reproducibly elicits
broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) in humans. The complex immunology underlying human bnAb
development suggests that a successful vaccine will likely contain a series of immunogens that guide bnAb
development 1-3. Such complex vaccines will require iterative design and evaluation in humans, necessitating
rapid cGMP production of potent immunogens. We and others have found that multimerizing HIV-1 Env on
nanoparticles (NPs) can augment its immunogenicity. HIV-1 Env trimer NP immunogens have been made
previously by encoding HIV-1 Env fused to NP subunits as a single gene. These fusion protein NPs display a
mixture of high-quality and low-quality, misfolded HIV-1 Env on their surfaces that can elicit immunodominant
non-neutralizing antibodies. Thus, laborious, time-consuming development work must be performed to
optimize the HIV-1 envelope production such that predominately well-folded envelope is fused to nanoparticle
subunits. Additionally, we have found during cGMP cell line development that protein yields of Env trimer NP
may be insufficient to enable cGMP manufacturing. The significance of this Project is that it will utilize an
already successful cGMP process to rapidly manufacture higher quality HIV-1 Env trimer NPs than previous
NPs encoded by single genes. We have already utilized this technology to overcome the pitfalls incurred with
fusion NPs, by using our innovative conjugation method that generates NPs with only well-folded HIV-1 Env on
their surface. This method utilizes the high specificity of sortase A conjugation to link highly purified, well-folded
HIV-1 Env to ferritin NPs. These sortase A-conjugated NPs (scNPs) can be assembled rapidly and preserve
the antigenic character of the HIV-1 Env, features critical for a vaccine regimen aiming to elicit durable,
protective bnAbs. This innovative, rapid NP platform is universal in nature, having been used for HIV-1 Env
trimers of various clades, SIVcpz Env trimers, and Spike proteins from other human pathogens such as SARS-
CoV-2. We will utilize this platform in combination with CAP256w34.80 designed to guide affinity maturation of
V2 Apex bnAbs in humans.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Affinity><Antibodies><Antigens><Apical><COVID-19 virus><COVID19 virus><Cell Line><CellLine><Chimera Protein><Chimeric Proteins><CoV-2><CoV2><Complex><Consumption><Cyclic GMP><Development><Early-Stage Clinical Trials><Evaluation><Ferritin><Fusion Protein><Genes><Goals><Guanosine Cyclic Monophosphate><HIV><HIV Vaccine Trials Network><HIV-1><HIV-1 vaccine><HIV-I><HIV1><HIV1 vaccine><HVTN><Human><Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human immunodeficiency virus 1><Immunology><LAV-HTLV-III><Link><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Methods><Modern Man><Nature><Persons><Phase 1 Clinical Trials><Phase I Clinical Trials><Preventative vaccine><Preventive vaccine><Process><Production><Prophylactic vaccine><Proteins><Regimen><Reproducibility><SARS corona virus 2><SARS-CO-V2><SARS-COVID-2><SARS-CoV-2><SARS-CoV2><SARS-associated corona virus 2><SARS-associated coronavirus 2><SARS-coronavirus-2><SARS-related corona virus 2><SARS-related coronavirus 2><SARSCoV2><Series><Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome CoV 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Corona Virus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus 2><Severe acute respiratory syndrome associated corona virus 2><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2><Severe acute respiratory syndrome related corona virus 2><Site><Specificity><Strains Cell Lines><Surface><Technology><Time><Vaccines><Virus-HIV><Work><Wuhan coronavirus><cGMP><cGMP production><coronavirus disease 2019 virus><coronavirus disease-19 virus><cultured cell line><design><designing><develop a vaccine><develop vaccines><development of a vaccine><developmental><hCoV19><human pathogen><immunogen><immunogenicity><innovate><innovation><innovative><iterative design><manufacture><nCoV2><nano particle><nano-sized particle><nanoparticle><nanosized particle><neutralizing antibody><phase I protocol><preservation><sortase><srtA gene product><vaccine development>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Nanotechnology; Prevention; Vaccine Related; Vaccine Related - AIDS
Harnessing CD89+ NK Cells for Novel Therapeutic Interventions Against HIV/SIV,Harnessing CD89+ NK Cells for Novel Therapeutic Interventions Against HIV/SIV,"While antiretroviral therapy (ART) can control the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and delay
disease progression, there is still no cure, and HIV remains a global public health challenge. A better
understanding of early and persistent immunological events in HIV infection is critical to inform novel
interventions. The majority of current strategies aiming to prevent, control or eradicate HIV rely on harnessing
effector functions of cytotoxic T cells, helper T cells, B cells and antibodies to attack HIV and HIV-infected cells.
However, natural killer (NK) cells might represent another subset for therapeutic modulation. Recently, our lab
has carried out in-depth, yet preliminary research into NK cells expressing the IgA receptor, CD89, using both
human and nonhuman primate samples. We have generated preliminary data showing that: (i) CD89+ NK cells
can be readily identified in various tissues including peripheral blood and mucosal tissues; (ii) CD89+ NK cells
display an altered signaling phenotype compared to CD89- NK cells; (iii) CD89+ NK cells are significantly
restricted in their activation potential; and (iv) CD89+ NK cells can be identified through multiplex imaging
indicating their relevant proximity in the GI mucosae. Collectively these data form the basis for our overarching
hypothesis that CD89 acts as an inhibitory checkpoint to regulate NK cell mucosal functions, and, therefore, may
serve as an attractive target for NK cell-based interventions and therapeutics in lentivirus infections. We will test
this hypothesis through two focused Exploratory Aims: (i) Characterize the role(s) and functional regulation
of CD89+ NK in the mucosae in normal and SIV/SHIV-infected macaques; and (ii) Investigate the role of
autologous CD89+ NK cells in therapeutic modulation of SIV infection. Ultimately, this knowledge has the
potential to inform strategies to tune CD89+ NK cells for preventive or therapeutic interventions and personalized
treatments, vaccine development, and strategies for reducing viral reservoirs.",<AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Activities of Daily Living><Activities of everyday life><Alimentary Canal><Anatomic Sites><Anatomic structures><Anatomy><Antibodies><Area><Autologous><B blood cells><B cell><B cells><B-Cells><B-Lymphocytes><B-cell><Biology><Body Tissues><CD3><CD3 Antigens><CD3 Complex><CD3 molecule><CD68 antigen><Cd68><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cell-Mediated Lympholytic Cells><Cells><Cellular Immune Function><Clone Cells><Color><Cytolytic T-Cell><Cytometry><Cytotoxic T Cell><Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes><Cytotoxic cell><Data><Digestive Tract><Disease Progression><Event><Exclusion><GI Tract><Gastrointestinal Tract><Gastrointestinal tract structure><HIV><HIV Infections><HTLV-III Infections><HTLV-III-LAV Infections><Harvest><Helper Cells><Helper T-Cells><Helper T-Lymphocytes><Helper-Inducer T-Cells><Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte><Human><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections><IgA><IgA FcR><IgA receptor><Immune><Immunes><Immunochemical Immunologic><Immunoglobulin A><Immunologic><Immunological><Immunologically><Immunologics><Inducer Cells><Inducer T-Lymphocytes><Infection><Infection Control><Infusion><Infusion procedures><Innate Immune System><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigation><K lymphocyte><Kinetics><Knowledge><LAV-HTLV-III><Lentivirus Infections><Lentivirus disease><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Lymphatic Tissue><Lymphoid Tissue><M mulatta><M. mulatta><Macaca><Macaca mulatta><Macaque><Measures><Mediating><Modern Man><Mucosa><Mucosal Tissue><Mucous Membrane><Myeloid Cells><NK Cells><Natural Killer Cells><OKT3 antigen><Outcome><Pathologic><Phenotype><Play><Population><Preventative intervention><Public Health><Publishing><Receptor Cell><Receptor Protein><Regulation><Research><Rhesus Macaque><Rhesus Monkey><Role><SHIV><SIV><Sampling><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Simian Immunodeficiency Viruses><Site><Staining method><Stains><T-Cells><T-Lymphocyte><T3 Antigens><T3 Complex><T3 molecule><Techniques><Testing><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Intervention><Tissues><Vaccine Design><Viral Burden><Viral Diseases><Viral Load><Viral Load result><Viral reservoir><Virus Diseases><Virus Replication><Virus reservoir><Virus-HIV><alimentary tract><antiretroviral therapy><antiretroviral treatment><biological signal transduction><check point receptors><checkpoint receptors><cohort><daily living function><daily living functionality><design><designing><develop a vaccine><develop vaccines><development of a vaccine><digestive canal><functional ability><functional capacity><immune function><immunoglobulin A Fc receptor><immunoglobulin A receptor><infusions><innovate><innovation><innovative><interest><intervention for prevention><intervention therapy><interventional strategy><jejunum><killer T cell><mucosal site><multiplexed imaging><new therapeutic approach><new therapeutic intervention><new therapeutic strategies><new therapy approaches><new treatment approach><new treatment strategy><non-human primate><nonhuman primate><novel><novel therapeutic approach><novel therapeutic intervention><novel therapeutic strategies><novel therapy approach><peripheral blood><personalization of treatment><personalized medicine><personalized therapy><personalized treatment><prevent><preventing><prevention intervention><preventional intervention strategy><preventive intervention><receptor><simian HIV><simian human immunodeficiency virus><social role><therapeutic target><thymus derived lymphocyte><vaccine development><viral infection><viral multiplication><viral replication><virus infection><virus multiplication><virus-induced disease>,Biotechnology; HIV/AIDS; Immunotherapy; Infectious Diseases; Prevention
Computational mapping of human B cell migration and differentiation pathways,Computational mapping of human B cell migration and differentiation pathways,"Human B cells play a fundamental role in the adaptive immune response to infection, development of protective
immunity from vaccination, and pathology of many autoimmune diseases. Central to all of these processes are
migration of B cells among different tissues and differentiation of B cells into functional subtypes. Currently,
understanding B cell migration and differentiation is limited because these processes are dynamic and difficult
to directly observe, particularly in humans. Our previous work has demonstrated that it is possible to detect
migration and differentiation events along evolutionary trees inferred from B cell receptor (BCR) sequences,
which are subject to rapid somatic hypermutation and antigen-driven selection during adaptive immune
responses. This is analogous to viral phylogeography, the use of evolutionary trees to track the spread of viruses
during epidemics. However, there are key differences in the biology of B cells and viruses that require modifying
and extending existing approaches to make them appropriate for B cells.
 The goal of this proposal is to enable B cell phylogeography. We will develop novel computational
methods that leverage recent advances in single B cell sequencing technology to infer how B cells migrate
between tissues and differentiate into cellular subtypes based on their activation states during immune
responses. The aims of this proposal focus on solving the roadblocks to the development of phylogeographic
methods for B cells. These methods will be validated by simulations and experimental analysis. We will work
with established experimental collaborators to translate these novel methods into meaningful outcomes in the
research of influenza vaccine response and the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including lupus and
myasthenia gravis. We will implement these methods in widely available free software, which will greatly increase
their potential to inform vaccination strategies against other pathogens like HIV and SARS-CoV-2, as well as
treatment of other B cell-mediated conditions such as multiple sclerosis and asthma.
 The K99 phase of this proposal will be guided by Prof. Steven Kleinstein at Yale School of Medicine, a
world leader in computational methods development for BCR sequence analysis, and Prof. Kevin O’Connor, a
leading experimental biologist in the B cell pathology of neurologic autoimmune diseases. The candidate, Dr.
Kenneth Hoehn, has a strong background in genetics and evolutionary biology, and has an established record
of developing evolutionary models to study B cell populations from BCR sequence data. The work detailed in
this proposal will fill gaps in the candidate’s training in B cell biology, single cell analysis, and software
development. The R00 phase will build off of this work to develop a highly generalizable framework for
characterizing the complex migration and differentiation patterns that underlie B cells’ role in vaccination and
autoimmunity. This will support new, medically-relevant discoveries about B cell biology, and serve as a
foundation for the candidate’s future as an independent computational immunologist.",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><21+ years old><AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency

Escape of maternal plasma broadly neutralizing antibody as a mechanism of mother to child HIV transmission,Escape of maternal plasma broadly neutralizing antibody as a mechanism of mother to child HIV transmission,"Abstract
Over 150,000 HIV-1 infants are infected via mother to child transmission (MTCT) each year, accounting for
nearly 10% of the global annual HIV-1 infections. Even implementation of highly effective antiretroviral therapy
(ART) cannot prevent up to 5% of HIV-1 infected women from transmitting the virus to their infants. Thus,
approaches that synergize with ART will be needed to eliminate MTCT. The most promising interventions in
under clinical development to prevent HIV infection includes passive administration or active induction of
broadly-neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Yet, paradoxically, broad neutralization activity in maternal plasma
has been associated with risk of infant transmission, raising concerns about the safety of these approaches in
pregnancy. Thus, a better understanding of the role of maternal neutralizing activity and MTCT risk is needed
to develop effective bnAb-based interventions, which together with ART can more effectively block MTCT.
HIV MTCT is a unique transmission route that occurs in the setting of preexisting antibody raised against
autologous viruses. We previously found that transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses in infants were more resistant
to neutralization by paired maternal plasma than non-transmitted maternal viruses. Moreover, we established
that bnAb activity in maternal plasma can drive the development of circulating viral escape variants that
become infant T/F viruses. We hypothesize that multispecificity of maternal plasma bnAb activity is associated
with reduced risk of MTCT and autologous virus escape from these functional responses by infant T/F viruses
is a risk factor for transmission. Moreover, identifying bnAb escape variants that are fit for transmission is
important to designing combination bnAb approaches that can effectively prevent virus transmission. We will
use the following three Specific Aims to test our hypotheses: (1) Compare the specificity and polyfunctionality
of plasma bnAb activity from transmitting and non-transmitting mothers to assess the role of maternal bnAb
activity in vertical virus transmission risk. (2) Determine if infant T/F viruses and circulating viruses of
transmitting mothers are more resistant to plasma neutralizing activity compared to that of non-transmitted
maternal variants from transmitting and non-transmitting mothers. (3) Define genetic signatures responsible
for escape from the maternal Env-specific B cell repertoire among transmitted infant Env variants using a
panel of native Env trimer-specific mAbs isolated from transmitting mothers. Defining the specificity and
function of pre-existing maternal neutralizing antibodies that can reduce virus escape and impede
transmission will be critical to design novel passive and active vaccine approaches that can eliminate HIV
transmission from mothers to infants, and is a tool to define the population impact of the future use of bnAb-
based prophylaxis on HIV transmission dynamics.","<7S Gamma Globulin><AIDS Virus><Accounting><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Active Immunization><Active vaccination><Antibodies><Antibody Repertoire><Antibody Response><Antibody Specificity><Antigenic Determinants><Autologous><B cell repertoire><Binding Determinants><Birth><Blood Plasma><Case Study><Cessation of life><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Clinical Treatment Moab><Clinical Trials><Death><Development><Epidemic><Epitopes><Future><Generations><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic defect><Gestation><Goals><HIV><HIV Infections><HIV therapy><HIV vaccine><HIV-1><HIV-I><HIV/AIDS Vaccines><HIV1><HTLV-III Infections><HTLV-III-LAV Infections><Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections><Human immunodeficiency virus 1><IgG><Immune><Immunes><Immunochemical Immunologic><Immunoglobulin G><Immunologic><Immunological><Immunologically><Immunologics><Impairment><Infant><Infection><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><LAV-HTLV-III><Lactation><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Maps><Maternal antibody><Measures><Mediating><Monoclonal Antibodies><Mother-to-child HIV transmission><Mothers><Mutation><Parturition><Passive Immunization><Plasma><Plasma Serum><Population><Pregnancy><Pregnant Women><Premature Infant><Preventative strategy><Prevention strategy><Preventive strategy><Prophylactic treatment><Prophylaxis><Regimen><Resistance><Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma><Risk><Risk Factors><Role><Route><Safety><Site><Specificity><Testing><Time><Transmission><Vaccines><Variant><Variation><Vertical Disease Transmission><Vertical Transmission><Viral><Viral Activity><Viral Function><Viral Physiology><Virus><Virus-HIV><Woman><antiretroviral therapy><antiretroviral treatment><case report><clinical development><cohort><depository><design><designing><developmental><expectant mother><expecting mother><gene signatures><genetic signature><genome mutation><high risk infant><human immunodeficiency virus vaccine><infant infection><infants born premature><infants born prematurely><infected infant><interventional strategy><lactating><lactational><mAbs><maternal immunization><maternal vaccination><monoclonal Abs><mother to child transmission><neutralizing antibody><novel><passive vaccination><pediatric HIV><pediatric HIV disease><pediatric HIV infection><pediatric human immunodeficiency virus><pediatric human immunodeficiency virus disease><pediatric human immunodeficiency virus infection><placental transfer><predict responsiveness><predicting response><pregnant mothers><premature baby><premature infant human><pressure><preterm baby><preterm infant><preterm infant human><prevent><preventing><repository><resistant><response><social role><synergism><tool><transmission process><vaccine strategy><viral transmission><virus envelope><virus transmission><vulnerable infant>","Biotechnology; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Maternal Health; Pediatric; Pediatric - AIDS; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn; Prevention; Vaccine Related; Women's Health Research"
Stanford-SLAC CryoET Specimen Preparation Service Center (SCSC),Stanford-SLAC CryoET Specimen Preparation Service Center (SCSC),"Project Summary
 In response to the NIH RFA-RM-19-009, we propose to establish the Stanford-SLAC
CryoET Specimen Preparation Service Center (SCSC) to accomplish four specific aims: (1)
establish a platform, which is available to the scientific community at large, to streamline the
preparation of samples suitable for downstream cryogenic electron tomography (cryoET) data
collection; (2) provide access to advanced cryo-specimen preparation techniques for a wide
range of samples: macromolecular complexes, microcrystals of biological materials, cell
lysates, organelles, cells and tissues; (3) generate a training curriculum for new users on the
preparation of frozen, hydrated biological specimens, with the option of carrying out correlative
cryo-fluorescence light microscopy (cryoFLM), cryo-focused ion beam scanning electron
microscopy (cryoFIB), and cryoET; and (4) adopt new methods for sample preparation using
innovative technologies developed elsewhere. In this proposal, we will leverage our existing
facilities and in-house expertise in each of the following imaging modalities and their integration
into a correlated sample preparation workflow: cryoFLM, cryoFIB, and cryoET. We will establish
all the necessary equipment dedicated to the proposed service and training activities. We will
prepare video curriculum materials to train new users in the aforementioned protocols. We will
adapt our existing infrastructure to manage project administration and resource allocations.
Administrative support is in place to help users with lodging arrangements, as well as laboratory
on-boarding and specimen biosafety approvals. We have a well set- up communication
infrastructure for remote users to participate in actual experiments, particularly for cryoFLM,
cryoFIB, and cryoET. We will provide access to existing Titan Krios microscopes to evaluate
whether the prepared samples are ready for data collection in the associated Hub, which will
be set up at another institution with separate NIH support. We will make our existing Stanford-
SLAC cryo-specimen preparation equipment available on a limited basis immediately after this
proposal is funded. We anticipate serving ~40 users per year once the Center is fully
operational in early Year 2 of the award period. We will also offer regular hands- on workshops
to train ~10-12 new users per year. We will disseminate our resources to the broad community
via a web portal and booths at professional societies’ annual conferences. The number of users
will increase in subsequent years as we and our recurring users optimize the use of the Center’s
resources. In Years 3-6, we will work closely with collaborators pioneering advanced protocols
such as semi-automated and automated cryoFIB and “lift-out” for tissue samples to implement
them in the proposed Center. Lastly, we will assemble a Scientific Advisory Committee of
experts to guide the practices of our Service Center and the ongoing implementation of cutting-
edge technologies.",<Academia><Adopted><Advisory Committees><Area><Award><Biocompatible Materials><Biological><Biomaterials><Body Tissues><Cell Body><Cells><Collaborations><Communication><Communities><Complex><Cryo-electron Microscopy><Cryo-electron tomography><Cryoelectron Microscopy><Curriculum><Data Collection><Dedications><Educational Curriculum><Educational workshop><Electron Cryomicroscopy><Electron Microscope><Equipment><Evaluation><Fluorescence Light Microscopy><Fluorescence Microscopy><Freezing><Funding><Goals><Grant><Hydration><Hydration status><Ice><In Situ><Industry><Infrastructure><Institution><Intracellular Structure><Ions><Laboratories><Leanness><Lifting><Macromolecular Complexes><Methods><Microscope><NIH><NIH RFA><National Institutes of Health><Organelles><P50 Mechanism><P50 Program><Preparation><Process><Professional Organizations><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Recurrence><Recurrent><Request for Applications><Research><Research Resources><Research Specimen><Resource Allocation><Resources><Sampling><Scanning><Scanning Electron Microscopy><Schedule><Selection Criteria><Services><Specialized Center><Specimen><Subcellular structure><Task Forces><Techniques><Technology><Thick><Thickness><Thinness><Tissue Sample><Tissues><Titan><Training><Training Activity><United States National Institutes of Health><Work><Workshop><advisory team><biologic><biological material><conference><convention><cryo-EM><cryo-EM tomography><cryoEM><cryoEM tomography><cryoelectron tomography><cryogenic electron microscopy><cryogenics><data management><electron cryo-tomography><electron tomography><experience><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><image-based method><imaging method><imaging modality><innovative technologies><instrument><instrumentation><internet portal><lesson plans><nanometer resolution><on-line portal><online portal><operation><operations><preparations><professional association><professional membership><professional society><response><structural biology><summit><symposia><symposium><tool><training module><web portal><web-based portal>,Bioengineering
Hemostatic Bioadhesive Paste for Coagulation-Independent Rapid Control of Bleeding,Hemostatic Bioadhesive Paste for Coagulation-Independent Rapid Control of Bleeding,"ABSTRACT
The objective of this proposal is to optimize and validate the hemostatic bioadhesive paste in compliance with
FDA regulatory guidance for the FDA IDE approval in advance of the future pivotal clinical trial and ultimate
regulatory clearance and commercialization. In light of the huge and rapidly growing clinical and economic costs
of major hemorrhagic events in cardiovascular and other surgeries, various hemostatic agents have been
developed and clinically tested. To date, however, there is no hemostatic solution that can achieve effective and
rapid hemostasis in frequent and high-risk bleeding of patients under anticoagulation or coagulopathic settings
due to the incompatibility of conventional coagulation-based hemostatic approaches. To address these
limitations of existing solutions, during the prior development (Phase I-equivalent), our collaborative team
developed a proof-of-concept prototype of a hemostatic bioadhesive paste for rapid (within 10 s) coagulation-
independent control of bleedings by uniquely utilizing the novel blood-resistant bioadhesive mechanism. The
preliminary pre-clinical validation and analysis based on in vivo rat and porcine models demonstrated the
promising hemostatic efficacy and underlying mechanism of the hemostatic bioadhesive paste for the
bioadhesion-based coagulation-independent rapid control of bleedings. Building upon the promising outcome of
the prior development, under the scope of this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR proposal, we will further optimize and
validate the hemostatic bioadhesive paste in compliance with relevant FDA regulatory guidance for the highly
effective and broadly affordable solution to treat high-risk bleeding in the anticoagulated or coagulopathic
patients. If successful, the proposed project will allow SanaHeal to prepare and submit the FDA IDE package in
advance to a pivotal clinical trial and ultimate commercialization with far-reaching benefits for patients and the
healthcare system.",<Acquired Von Willebrand syndrome><Acquired von Willebrand disease><Address><Adhesions><Adhesives><Anticoagulation><Artificial Heart Ventricle><Artificial Ventricles><Atrial Fibrillation><Auricular Fibrillation><Biocompatible Materials><Biomaterials><Bleeding><Blood><Blood Clotting><Blood Coagulation Disorders><Blood Coagulation Factor><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Blood coagulation><Body Tissues><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Cellulose><Chemicals><Clinical><Clinical Trials><Clotting><Coagulation><Coagulation Disorder><Coagulation Factors><Coagulation Process><Coagulopathy><Common Rat Strains><Cyclic GMP><Dependence><Development><Devices><Disease><Disorder><Effectiveness><Ensure><Event><FDA approved><Family suidae><Fibrin><Freezing><Future><Gelatin><Guanosine Cyclic Monophosphate><Health Care Systems><Healthcare Systems><Heart Vascular><Hemorrhage><Hemostasis><Hemostatic Agents><Hemostatic function><Hemostatics><Heparin><Heparinic Acid><Hydrocarbon oils><In Vitro><Injury><LVAD><Light><Liquid Paraffin><Liquid Petrolatum><Liver><Lytotoxicity><Mechanics><Medical><Medical Device><Medical emergency><Methods><Mineral Oil><Modeling><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Operative Hemorrhage><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Oral><Organ><Outcome><Paste substance><Pastes><Patients><Performance><Perioperative><Phase><Photoradiation><Pigs><Polyanhydroglucuronic Acid><Preclinical Testing><Preparation><Radiation><Rat><Rats Mammals><Rattus><Research Design><Residual><Residual state><Resistance><Risk><SBIR><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Solid><Sterility><Sterilization><Study Type><Suidae><Surgical><Surgical Blood Loss><Surgical Hemorrhage><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><Swine><System><Technology><Testing><Thrombase><Thrombin><Time><Tissues><Translating><Trauma><Validation><Ventricle-Assist Device><Warfarin><Work><Writing><aged group><aged groups><aged individual><aged individuals><aged people><aged person><aged persons><aged population><aged populations><aging population><alpha-Cellulose><biocompatibility><biological material><biomaterial compatibility><bleeding disorder><blood loss><cGMP><circulatory system><clotting disorder><clotting factor><commercial scale manufacturing><commercialization><cost><cytotoxicity><design><designing><developmental><economic cost><fibrinogenase><hepatic body system><hepatic organ system><high risk><in vivo><in vivo Model><injuries><left ventricular assist device><manufacturing ramp-up><manufacturing scale-up><mechanic><mechanical><meeting><meetings><mortality><novel><pig model><piglet model><population aging><porcine><porcine model><pre-clinical><pre-clinical evaluation><pre-clinical study><pre-clinical testing><preclinical><preclinical evaluation><preclinical study><preparations><primary end point><primary endpoint><prototype><resistant><response><scale up batch><scale up production><seal><sterile><study design><suid><surgery><swine model><upscale manufacturing><validations><ventricular assist device>,Bioengineering; Cardiovascular; Hematology
Mitosis in Confining Microenvironments,Mitosis in Confining Microenvironments,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell division underlies the development of humans from embryos to full-grown adults, regenerative processes
such as wound healing, and diseases such as cancer. While much is known about the intracellular aspects of
mammalian cell division, less is known about the extracellular aspects of cell division. In many physiological
contexts, cells divide in mechanically confining microenvironments, including dense extracellular matrices
(ECMs) and growing tumors. Cell division requires extensive morphological changes, including significant growth
during the G1 phase of the cell cycle and elongation along the mitotic axis during mitosis, or mitotic elongation.
Both growth and mitotic elongation are strictly required for successful cell division. A mechanically confining
microenvironment provides a physical barrier to both cell growth and mitotic elongation, and cells must overcome
this confinement for successful cell division. Our recent studies have shown that single dividing cells in three-
dimensional (3D) matrices generate protrusive forces along the mitotic axis to drive mitotic elongation via a
combination of interpolar spindle elongation and cytokinetic ring contraction. We have also found that cell growth
during the G1 phase is mediated by outward force generation. However, it remains unclear how these forces
and their underlying mechanisms adapt to confining microenvironments with a wide range of stiffness and
viscoelasticity. In this project, we will determine how cells tune extracellular forces to sustain cell division in highly
confining microenvironments, using a powerful combination of rigorous agent-based modeling and experiments
with engineered biomaterials for 3D cell culture. We hypothesize that in microenvironments with increased
confinement, i) protrusive activity increases to make space and activate mechanosensitive channels for driving
G1 phase cell growth via increased osmotic pressure, and ii) enhanced cytokinetic ring contraction drives mitotic
elongation. The main hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following three aims: (1) Determine how mitotic
elongation of isolated cells within highly confining microenvironments is accomplished via a novel force feedback
mechanism; (2) Define how isolated cells achieve G1 phase cell growth in highly confining microenvironments;
and (3) Establish how growth and mitotic elongation of cells in growing spheroids induce overall expansion of
spheroids in highly confining microenvironments. The proposed research project is significant because it will
reveal how cells modulate their force generation, to drive cell growth and mitotic elongation for cell division in
physiologically relevant microenvironments, and also elucidate the role of matrix remodeling and multicellular
cooperation in cell division. The approach is innovative because of i) the development and use of agent-based
models that can rigorously capture the most important aspects of cell growth, mitotic elongation, and confining
microenvironments with complex rheological properties, ii) the focus on extracellular aspects of cell division, iii)
the role of matrix viscoelasticity in cell division, and iv) the examination of the physical basis for spheroid growth.",<3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><3D cell culture><3D culture><Actin-Activated ATPase><Alginates><Automobile Driving><Autoregulation><Behavior><Biological Function><Biological Process><Cell Attachment><Cell Body><Cell Culture Techniques><Cell Isolation><Cell Mobility><Cell Segregation><Cell Separation><Cell Separation Technology><Cell division><Cell membrane><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cell-Matrix Adhesions><Cell-Matrix Junction><Cells><Cellular Expansion><Cellular Growth><Cellular Mobility><Characteristics><Collagen><Collagen Type I><Complex><Computer Models><Computerized Models><Cultured Cells><Cytoplasmic Membrane><Development><Disease><Disorder><ECM><Elasticity><Experimental Models><Extracellular Matrix><Feedback><First Gap Phase><G1 Phase><G1 period><Gap Phase 1><Gel><Generalized Growth><Generations><Goals><Growth><Homeostasis><Human><Ion Channel><Ionic Channels><Knowledge><Location><M Phase><Measurement><Mechanics><Mediating><Membrane Channels><Mission><Mitosis><Mitosis Stage><Mitotic><Modeling><Modern Man><Morphology><Movement><Myosin ATPase><Myosin Adenosine Triphosphatase><Myosin Adenosinetriphosphatase><Myosins><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Natural regeneration><Osmotic Pressure><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiological Homeostasis><Plasma Membrane><Process><Property><Public Health><Recommendation><Regeneration><Relaxation><Research><Stress><Text><Tissue Growth><Type 1 Collagen><United States National Institutes of Health><body movement><cell culture><cell cultures><cell growth><cell osmotic pressure><cell sorting><cell type><computational modeling><computational models><computer based models><computerized modeling><defined contribution><developmental><disability><driving><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><force feedback><insight><mechanic><mechanical><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new therapeutics><new therapy><next generation therapeutics><novel><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><ontogeny><plasmalemma><regenerate><spheroids><three dimensional><three dimensional cell culture><viscoelasticity>,Bioengineering
Studying astrocyte borders using injectable biomaterials,Studying astrocyte borders using injectable biomaterials,"Astrocyte border formation involving proliferative reactive changes in local astrocytes is a conserved feature of
many CNS disorders including neurotraumatic, neurodegenerative, neuroinflammatory, and neoplastic
diseases. Across disorders, astrocyte borders form against a non-neural niche compartment, containing
stromal and peripherally derived myeloid cells, whose cellular composition varies across disorders and stages
of disease. Despite targeted loss of function studies revealing the neuroprotective roles of astrocyte borders,
the context-specific functions of astrocyte borders at different non-neural niches are still poorly understood.
The development of new tools and techniques to dissect the complex biology at astrocyte borders in a
simplified, focal, and reproducible model system is needed to address important knowledge gaps. Injecting
biomaterials into mouse brain promotes spatiotemporally controlled astrocyte border formation and we see an
opportunity to use biomaterials to generate a new bioassay to study astrocyte borders. The main objective of
this project is to advance a new bioassay to stimulate and characterize astrocyte borders and use this
bioassay to profile several different functional states of astrocyte borders conferred by interactions with diverse
non-neural cell populations. Our overall hypothesis is that by locally injecting cellulose-based biomaterials with
different physiochemical properties into the mouse striatum we will stimulate distinct non-neural niches that will
confer temporal- and biomaterial-dependent changes in astrocyte states during the transition into astrocyte
borders which we can profile. In aim 1, we will optimize the bioassay to study astrocyte borders by combining
injectable, non-resorbable methyl cellulose hydrogels with viral vectors (AAVs) enabling astrocyte specific
expression of RiboTag. At 7, 14, 28, and 70 days after hydrogel injection into the mouse striatum, mRNA from
the formed astrocyte borders will be recovered by RiboTag immunoprecipitation and processed by RNA-Seq.
Cohorts of mice taken at the same timepoints will be processed by IHC to visualize changes in astrocyte
morphology, ribosome trafficking, and multicellular interactions. To validate capacity to detect altered astrocyte
border states we will disrupt astrocyte border formation by controlled release of molecular inhibitors. In aim 2,
we will evaluate astrocyte border states at non-neural niches with different immune cell compositions that will
be created by chemically modifying cellulose-based hydrogels to display non-fouling, immunosuppressive, or
immunostimulatory functional groups as well as through local delivery of small molecule immunoregulators
from hydrogels. Through this project, we will make important technical innovations to develop a new bioassay
that will allow us to identify conserved- and context-dependent mechanisms involved in astrocyte border
formation and function. This work will provide the foundations on which to explore therapeutic targeting of
astrocyte borders to direct CNS disorder outcomes and improve medical device biocompatibility in future work.",<Address><Adopted><Apoplexy><Area><Assay><Astrocytes><Astrocytus><Astroglia><Attenuated><Autoimmune Status><Autoimmunity><Bioassay><Biocompatible Materials><Biologic Models><Biological Assay><Biological Markers><Biological Models><Biology><Biomaterials><Body Tissues><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Brain Vascular Accident><CD115><CD115 Gene><CNS Diseases><CNS Injury><CNS disorder><CSF1R><CSF1R gene><CSFMR><Cell Body><Cells><Cellulose><Central Nervous System Diseases><Central Nervous System Disorders><Cerebral Stroke><Cerebrovascular Apoplexy><Cerebrovascular Stroke><Charge><Chemicals><Chemistry><Citrucel><Colony Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor Gene><Complex><Corpus Striatum><Corpus striatum structure><Development><Devices><Disease><Disorder><Encephalon><Engineering><Ensure><Evaluation><Fortification><Foundations><Future><Gliotoxin><Goals><Hortega cell><Hydrogels><Immune><Immune Precipitation><Immunes><Immunohistochemistry><Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue><Immunohistochemistry Staining Method><Immunoprecipitation><Infection><Inflammatory><Injectable><Injections><Ischemia><Knowledge><Label><Macrophage><Mechanics><Medical Device><Messenger RNA><Methodological Studies><Methods><Methyl Cellulose><Methylcellulose><Mice><Mice Mammals><Microglia><Model System><Molecular><Morphology><Murine><Mus><Myeloid Cells><Mφ><Neoplasms><Nerve Degeneration><Neuron Degeneration><Outcome><Perfusion><Peripheral><Phenotype><Polyanhydroglucuronic Acid><Polymers><Population><Process><Property><RNA Seq><RNA sequencing><RNAseq><Recovery><Regulation><Reproducibility><RiboTag><Ribosomes><Role><Spinal Column><Spine><Striate Body><Striatum><Stroke><Surface><Techniques><Therapeutic><Tissues><Trauma><Vertebral column><Viral Vector><Visualization><Work><Wound Repair><alpha-Cellulose><antagonism><antagonist><astrocytic glia><attenuate><attenuates><backbone><bio-markers><biocompatibility><biologic marker><biological material><biomarker><biomaterial compatibility><brain attack><c-FMS><c-fms Genes><c-fms Proto-Oncogenes><central nervous system injury><cerebral vascular accident><cerebrovascular accident><cohort><comparative><controlled release><developmental><functional group><gitter cell><global gene expression><global transcription profile><improved><inhibitor><injured CNS><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><loss of function><mRNA><mechanic><mechanical><mesoglia><methyl ether Cellulose><microglial cell><microgliocyte><neoplasia><neoplastic><neoplastic growth><neural><neural degeneration><neural inflammation><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neuroinflammation><neuroinflammatory><neurological degeneration><neuronal degeneration><neuroprotection><neuroprotective><perivascular glial cell><polymer><polymeric><response><small molecule><social role><spatiotemporal><striatal><stroked><strokes><therapeutic target><tool><trafficking><transcriptome><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing><transcriptomics><wound healing><wound recovery><wound resolution>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Neurosciences
Restoration of Neuromuscular Function Following Critical Nerve Gap Injuries,Restoration of Neuromuscular Function Following Critical Nerve Gap Injuries,"1 Abstract – More than 500,000 surgical procedures are performed annually in the United States to address
 2 peripheral nerve injuries at a cost of more than $1.1B. Fewer than 50% of patients report satisfactory functional
 3 recovery following nerve injury repair procedures, likely due to slow axonal regrowth and difficulty in bridging
 4 across the sites of injury due to inflammation, scarring, and axonal misdirection. Poor recovery from nerve injuries
 5 leads to significant impacts on patient quality of life. For example, motor and/or sensory impairment from nerve
 6 injuries can prevent patients from performing basic daily activities, can be accompanied by chronic pain, and
 7 result in severe psychosocial impacts. Injuries to proximal segments and gaps > 1 cm are challenging and have
 8 inconsistent outcomes, while gaps larger than 3 cm seldom achieve any meaningful recovery. A number of
 9 products used for nerve gap injury repair such as conduits and allografts exist; however, none has shown
10 compelling clinical improvements in functional outcomes, particularly when compared to the “gold standard”
11 autograft. Renerva has developed Peripheral Nerve Matrix (PNM), a tissue-based hydrogel derived from porcine
12 nerve that can be used as a nerve conduit filler for the purpose of improving functional outcomes following the
13 repair of challenging gap injuries. PNM has been shown to modulate key early events in the nerve regeneration
14 process including macrophage recruitment, macrophage polarization towards a pro-regenerative/angiogenic
15 phenotype, and Schwann cell recruitment. In a sub-critical (0.8 cm) rodent nerve gap injury model, silicone
16 conduits filled with PNM were shown to increase axon extension (10x empty conduit control) and improve
17 functional recovery (compound motor action potential; 2x control), which was equivalent to the improvements
18 obtained using control autografts. While promising, PNM has yet to be tested in critical nerve gap defect models,
19 and additional optimization of the PNM formulation could yield results exceeding the performance of nerve
20 autografts. In this Phase I project, Renerva will optimize the PNM formulation (gel concentration and residual
21 chondroitin sulfate content) and mechanical properties (rheologic and compressive modulus) with the goal to
22 exceed the performance of the gold-standard nerve autograft in a rat critical nerve gap injury model (1.5 cm). An
23 established suite of longitudinal motor and sensory endpoints will be employed over a period of 12 weeks to
24 assess in vivo recovery. Electrophysiologic function as well as multiple histologic and immuno-labeling endpoints
25 will be performed at termination. Renerva will further test the shelf stability of the optimized PNM formulation via
26 in vitro and in vivo studies. The proposed objectives address critical requirements for regulatory and future clinical
27 use of PNM, and will critically de-risk PNM to enable Phase II of this project. Phase II will determine the optimized
28 PNM's ability to promote recovery in clinically relevant large gap injuries (>3 cm) in a large animal model and
29 support the completion of the safety tests required for commercializing the optimized PNM product. This project
30 will advance the field and allow clinicians to offer an effective product for critical size nerve gap injuries.",<Acceleration><Achievement><Achievement Attainment><Action Potentials><Address><Affect><Allografting><American><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Autograft><Autologous Transplantation><Autotransplant><Axon><Biocompatible Materials><Biomaterials><Body Tissues><Bovine Species><Cattle><Cell Body><Cells><Chondroitin Sulfates><Cicatrix><Clinical><Collagen Type I><Common Rat Strains><Complex><Data><Defect><Development><Economic Burden><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Engineering><Environment><Evaluation><Event><Failure><Family suidae><Filler><Formulation><Future><Gel><Generalized Growth><Goals><Growth><Growth Agents><Growth Factor><Growth Substances><Histologic><Histologically><Hydrogels><In Vitro><Inflammation><Injury><Length><Life><Macrophage><Maintenance><Marketing><Mechanics><Microsurgery><Modeling><Modulus><Motor><Mφ><Natural regeneration><Nerve><Nerve Crush><Nerve Regeneration><Nerve Tissue><Nervous Tissue><Neurilemma Cell><Neurilemmal Cell><Neuro-regeneration><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Neuroregeneration><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Outcome><Patients><Performance><Peripheral Nerves><Peripheral Nervous System><Peripheral nerve injury><Phase><Phenotype><Pigs><Procedures><Process><Property><Proteins><Proteins Growth Factors><QOL><Qualifying><Quality of life><Rat><Rats Mammals><Rattus><Recovery><Recovery of Function><Regeneration><Reporting><Residual><Residual state><Risk><Rodent><Rodentia><Rodents Mammals><Scars><Schwann Cells><Sensory><Sensory impairment><Series><Silicones><Site><Suidae><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><Swine><System><Techniques><Technology><Temperature><Testing><Time><Tissue Growth><Tissues><Translating><Tube><Type 1 Collagen><United States><Work><autologous graft><autotransplantation><biocompatibility><biological material><biomaterial compatibility><bovid><bovine><chronic pain><clinical relevance><clinical translation><clinically relevant><clinically translatable><commercialization><cost><cow><developmental><efficacy testing><electrophysiological><functional improvement><functional outcomes><functional recovery><hydrogen sulfate Chondroitin><immunogenicity><improve function><improved><improved functional outcomes><in vivo><injuries><injury and repair><mechanic><mechanical><mechanical properties><model of animal><motor impairment><movement impairment><movement limitation><nerve autograft><nerve damage><nerve gap><nerve injury><nerve reconstruction><nerve repair><nervous system regeneration><neural injury><neural regeneration><neuromuscular function><neuroregenerative><ontogeny><peripheral nerve crush injuries><porcine><pre-clinical><pre-clinical efficacy><pre-clinical safety><preclinical><preclinical efficacy><preclinical safety><prevent><preventing><psychosocial><recruit><regenerate><regenerated nerve><regenerative><release factor><repair><repaired><restoration><safety testing><suid><surgery><translation strategy><translational approach><translational strategy>,Bioengineering; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Peripheral Neuropathy; Physical Injury - Accidents and Adverse Effects; Regenerative Medicine; Rehabilitation; Transplantation
Lysosomal Regeneration (LysoGen) and Rescue as a Treatment for Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD),Lysosomal Regeneration (LysoGen) and Rescue as a Treatment for Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD),"ABSTRACT
This proposal describes a novel concept for acidification of the lysosome and, subsequently, restoration of au-
tophagic flux. Autophagy, the intracellular process by which proteins and organelles are degraded, requires an
acidic lysosome. Failure to acidify the lysosomal compartment leads to accumulation of autophagosomes, lipids,
and associated undigested content. Impaired lysosomal acidification and reduced autophagic flux are central to
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hereafter referred to by its new nomenclature, metabolic-dysfunction
associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). The risk factors for developing MASLD increase with advancing age
and, therefore, not surprisingly, MASLD occurs primarily among the middle-aged and the elderly. Current phar-
macological interventions do not target the liver directly to treat MASLD and, instead, affect secondary pathways
or mechanisms (e.g., GLP-1 receptor agonists to decrease food intake). Key to our advance is the engineering
of a treatment that responds to the pH of a dysfunctional lysosome (pH 5.7 - 6) to release acid and, therein,
further lower the pH to a healthy/normal value (pH 4 - 5). This acid-activated therapy, which we call LysoGen
(short for “lysosomal regeneration”) is composed of polyester-based co-polymers comprising a potent diacid,
tetrafluorosuccinic acid (TFSA). We hypothesize that, upon accumulation in liver lysosomes after intrave-
nous administration, LysoGen will release acid, thereby restoring lysosomal acidity and autophagic flux,
as well as rescuing functional and histological hallmarks of MASLD, such as improved glucose/insulin
tolerance and reduced lipid droplet accumulation in the liver. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the ex-
tent of restoration will depend on the LysoGen polymer composition and dosing regimen. Importantly,
substantial preliminary data support the proposed studies, well-characterized materials and rigorous experi-
mental designs are established, and essential cross-disciplinary collaborations and expertise (polymer chemis-
try, biomaterials, cell metabolism, autophagy, and MASLD) are in place to address these hypotheses. LysoGen
provides an unprecedented opportunity to treat MASLD with a first-of-its-kind therapy. Herein, we seek to in-
crease our understanding of this new technology and its impact on the biology and pathology of the MASLD
disease state as well as elucidate and optimize this approach as a prelude to future clinical translation. The
specific aims of this five-year proposal include: Aim 1. Synthesize and characterize LysoGen polymers that
activate at pH 6 and are targeted to lysosomes; Aim 2. Determine the in vitro bioavailability and resulting bioac-
tivity of LysoGen; and, Aim 3. Evaluate the toxicity, biodistribution and efficacy of the optimized LysoGen formu-
lation in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced MASLD mouse model.","<1,2-Ethanediol><2-Hydroxyethanol><Acidity><Acids><Address><Affect><Age><Agonist><Autophagocytosis><Autophagosome><Bioavailability><Biocompatible Materials><Biodistribution><Biological Availability><Biology><Biomaterials><Butanedioic Acid><Butanediols><Butylene Glycols><Cell Body><Cell Function><Cell Growth and Maintenance><Cell Maintenance><Cell Membrane Lipids><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Metabolic Process><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Charge><Cirrhosis><Collaborations><D-Glucose><Data><Dextrose><Dihydroxybutanes><Dihydroxyethanes><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Dose><Drug Metabolic Detoxication><Drug Metabolic Detoxification><Dysfunction><Eating><Elderly><Engineering><Ensure><Esterified Fatty Acids><Ethanediols><Ethylene Glycols><Evaluation><Experimental Designs><Exposure to><Failure><Fatty Acids><Fatty Liver><Food Intake><Formulation><Free Fatty Acids><Functional disorder><Future><GLP-1 receptor><GLP-I receptor><Glucose><Glycolates><Hep G2><HepG2><HepG2 cell line><Hepatic><Hepatic Cells><Hepatic Disorder><Hepatic Failure><Hepatic Parenchymal Cell><Hepatocarcinoma><Hepatocellular Carcinoma><Hepatocellular cancer><Hepatocyte><Hepatoma><Hexadecanoates><High Fat Diet><Histologic><Histologically><Human><Hydrolysis><Hydrophobicity><Impairment><In Vitro><Incidence><Insulin Resistance><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Label><Lactic acid><Libraries><Lipids><Liver><Liver Cells><Liver Cells Carcinoma><Liver Failure><Liver Steatosis><Liver diseases><Lysosomal Function Inhibition><Lysosomes><Measures><Mediating><Membrane Lipids><Metabolic><Metabolic Drug Detoxications><Metabolic dysfunction><Metabolism of Toxic Agents><Mice><Mice Mammals><Mitochondria><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular Weight><Monoethylene Glycol><Murine><Mus><NAFLD><Natural regeneration><Nomenclature><Nonesterified Fatty Acids><Normal Range><Normal Values><Obesity><Organelles><Palmitates><Particle Size><Pathology><Pathway interactions><Physiologic Availability><Physiopathology><Polyesters><Polymer Chemistry><Polymers><Prevalence><Primary carcinoma of the liver cells><Process><Property><Proteins><Regeneration><Regimen><Rhodamine><Risk Factors><Safety><Saturated Fatty Acids><Steatohepatitis><Structure><Subcellular Process><Succinic Acids><Therapeutic><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Triacylglycerol><Triglycerides><V-ATPase><V-type ATPase><Variant><Variation><Work><abnormal protein homeostasis><abnormal proteostasis><adiposity><advanced age><age associated disease><age associated disorder><age associated impairment><age dependent disease><age dependent disorder><age dependent impairment><age related human disease><age-related disease><age-related disorder><age-related impairment><ages><autophagy><biocompatibility><biological material><biomaterial compatibility><cell metabolism><cellular metabaolism><cirrhotic><clinical translation><clinically translatable><copolymer><corpulence><defective proteostasis><design><designing><detoxification><dietary><disease model><disorder model><dosage><ethylene glycol><geriatric><glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor><glycolic acid><hepatic body system><hepatic disease><hepatic organ system><hepatic steatosis><hepatopathy><hepatosteatosis><improved><in vivo><insight><insulin resistant><insulin sensitivity><insulin tolerance><interventional strategy><intravenous administration><late endosome><liver carcinoma><liver disorder><lysosome membrane><mid life><mid-life><middle age><middle aged><midlife><mitochondrial><mouse model><murine model><new technology><non-alcohol fatty liver disease><non-alcoholic fatty liver disease><non-alcoholic liver disease><nonalcoholic fatty liver disease><novel><novel technologies><operation><operations><particle><pathophysiology><pathway><pharmacologic><polymer><polymeric><protein homeostasis decline><protein homeostasis deficiency><protein homeostasis dysfunction><protein homeostasis failure><protein homeostasis loss><proteostasis decline><proteostasis defect><proteostasis deficiency><proteostasis dysfunction><proteostasis dysregulation><proteostasis failure><proteostasis impairment><proteostasis loss><regenerate><response><restoration><rho><senior citizen><uptake><vacuolar ATPase><vacuolar H+-ATPase><vacuolar membrane H(+)-ATPase>",Bioengineering; Chronic Liver Disease and Cirrhosis; Digestive Diseases; Liver Disease; Nutrition; Regenerative Medicine
Injectable Optoacoustic Retina Prostheses,Injectable Optoacoustic Retina Prostheses,"Project Summary
 Retinal degenerative diseases are the leading cause of irreversible vision loss. Current retina prosthesis are
solid state implantable devices designed to stimulate sensation of vision in the eyes of individuals with these
significant conditions. Resolution and pixel density are limited in the existing devices. In addition, these solid-
state implants require invasive surgical incision and have risks and challenges post-op. New technologies and
methods are still being sought for minimally invasive prostheses for precise and non-genetic retina stimulation.
In this Trailblazer application, we propose an injectable optoacoustic retina prosthesis for high precision retina
stimulation. The injectable prosthesis is a soft biocompatible optoacoustic material which can be injected in
targeted areas in retina. Coupled with patterned illumination via a scanning strategy, the injectable retina
prostheses are expected to achieve retinal stimulation with a spatial resolution of 40-50 µm. Such unprecedent
injection strategy, ultra-high spatial precision, and potential of massive parallel capabilities, together with the soft
and biocompatible design, offer clear advantages. A multi-disciplinary team with complementary expertise is
assembled to perform the proposed activities. Prof. Chen Yang (PI) is an expert in nanomaterials and neural
devices and interfaces for modulation and regeneration. Prof. Serge Picaud (Co-I, Institut de la Vision, France)
has 30 years research experience in retina and vision. Our team has pioneered ultra-high precision optoacoustic
neuromodulation. We have successfully shown the retina can be directly stimulated by optoacoustic. Our central
hypothesis that via the design of the injectable optoacoustic retina prostheses, we will achieve minimally invasive
retina stimulation at an unprecedented 50 micro-meter spatial precision. To test this central hypothesis, the
following specific aims are proposed. In Aim 1 and 2, we will develop a highly efficient photoacoustic injectable
biomaterial and demonstrate high precision retinal stimulation at micrometer-scale resolution by multi-electrode
array recording of retinal tissues. In Aim 3, we will Evaluate the safety and efficacy of stimulation by injectable
optoacoustic prostheses in rodent models. These efforts are expected to generate a conceptually new injectable
prosthesis design offering massively parallel, high precision and genetics-free optoacoustic stimulation with
translational potential to human.","<Adverse effects><Age related macular degeneration><Age-Related Maculopathy><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Area><Artificial Eye><Biocompatible Materials><Biomaterials><Blindness><Body Tissues><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Chemicals><Cicatrix><Clinical Trials><Collaborations><Complex><Complication><Coupled><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Device Designs><Devices><Electrical Impedance><Electrodes><Encephalon><Esthesia><Eye><Eyeball><Feasibility Studies><Fiber><Film><Foundations><France><Genetic><Human><Hydrogels><Illumination><Image><Impedance><Implant><In Situ><Individual><Injectable><Injections><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Label><Legal><Lighting><MR Imaging><MR Tomography><MRI><MRIs><Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Medical><Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance><Methods><Modern Man><NMR Imaging><NMR Tomography><Natural regeneration><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Cell><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurocyte><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neurons><Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Ocular Prosthesis><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Otomy><Patients><Pattern><Performance><Physiology><Pigmentary Retinopathy><Prosthesis><Prosthesis Design><Prosthetic device><Prosthetics><Regeneration><Research><Resolution><Retina><Retinal Degeneration><Retinitis Pigmentosa><Risk><Rodent><Rodent Model><Rodentia><Rodents Mammals><Safety><Scanning><Scars><Sensation><Sight><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><Surgical incisions><Tapetoretinal Degeneration><Technology><Testing><Tissues><United States><Vision><Zeugmatography><age dependent macular degeneration><age induced macular degeneration><age related macular disease><age related macular dystrophy><artificial retina><biocompatibility><biological material><biomaterial compatibility><biomedical implant><blind><clinical translation><clinically translatable><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><degenerative retina diseases><density><design><designing><electric impedance><experience><eye prosthesis><flexibility><flexible><imaging><implant device><implantable device><improved><in vivo><incision><indwelling device><interventional strategy><meter><minimally invasive><model of animal><multi-electrode arrays><multidisciplinary><multielectrode arrays><nanomaterials><neural><neural circuit><neural circuitry><neural control><neural regulation><neurocircuitry><neurodegenerative illness><neuromodulation><neuromodulatory><neuronal><neuroregulation><new technology><non-genetic><nongenetic><novel technologies><personalized genetics><precision genetics><prosthetic design><prosthetic retina><prosthetic vision><regenerate><resolutions><restore sight><restore vision><retina degeneration><retina implantation><retinal degenerative><retinal degenerative diseases><retinal implant><retinal prosthesis><retinal prosthetic><retinal stimulation><rod and cone dystrophy><rod-cone dystrophy><scale up><senile macular disease><sight restoration><solid state><subretinal injection><surgery><synaptic circuit><synaptic circuitry><technology platform><technology system><tissue culture><translational opportunities><translational potential><ultrasound><vision loss><vision prosthesis><vision restoration><visual function><visual loss><visual prosthesis><visual prosthetic>",Assistive Technology; Bioengineering; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Rehabilitation
NINDS Human Cell and Data Repository (U24),NINDS Human Cell and Data Repository (U24),"NINDS Application Abstract
Pluripotent stem cells were originally isolated from embryos but their utility as tools for research and therapeutic
development was severely restricted due to ethical considerations as well as the inability to derive stem cells
from subjects with known disorders. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) generated from adult somatic
cells were first described in 2007. Since then, hiPSCs have been established from subjects with specific
disorders (many with known genotypes) and then differentiated to relevant cell types such as neurons for central
nervous system disorders. Using these hiPSC we can create “disease models in a dish” that can model cell
development and disease progression and be used for drug screening and for toxicology testing. However,
human genetic diversity has hampered the usefulness of individual hiPSC for disease modeling. Controls often
consist of age and sex-matched non-affected family members or other subjects. The CRISPR (clustered
regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas system can now generate isogenic hiPSC that will serve
as better controls and help eliminate effects that are due to genetic background, thus providing a better
understanding of mechanisms of human disease and development.
 The NINDS Human Cell and Data Repository (NHCDR) was established to collect, derive and distribute
human cells such as skin fibroblasts and blood cells and convert these to iPSCs for research on
neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Dystonia and Frontotemporal Degeneration. Since 1998, RUCDR Infinite
Biologics® (RUCDR) has provided the NIH, private foundations and the global scientific community with the
highest quality biomaterials, technical consultation, and logistical support for human genetics research. In 2011,
RUCDR began providing its stem cell services to the NIH, including source cell and iPSC banking; iPSC
generation; iPSC gene editing; and source cell and iPSC distribution. In 2015, RUCDR successfully competed
for the NHCDR and in the past 5 years the catalog has grown to contain 268 FCL lines from 256 subjects and
259 iPSC lines from 132 subjects, including the addition of 7 isogenic pairs of iPSC. During this time RUCDR
shipped 458 orders for 1538 cell lines to investigators around the world. The continuing mission of the NHCDR
is to work with NINDS investigators and staff on all aspects of study management to collect, process and
distribute the highest quality cell lines from human subjects. This effort includes the culturing of fibroblasts from
skin biopsies, the isolation of lymphocytes from blood, and the derivation of iPSC lines from both cell types.
RUCDR will continue to provide a comprehensive range of quality testing of iPSCs to ensure they conform to
the highest standards. If requested, we will also provide additional services to the global community, including
the generation of neural stem cells (NSCs) and different types of neurons. RUCDR will continue to exhibit
scientific flexibility to grow and adapt to leading best practices in the stem cell field.",<21+ years old><AD dementia><Adult><Adult Human><Age><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease

ALS Efficiently Networking Advanced Beam Line Experiments (ALS-ENABLE),ALS Efficiently Networking Advanced Beam Line Experiments (ALS-ENABLE),"Overall Summary/Abstract
The overall goal of this proposal is to continue to provide an integrated, efficient synchrotron structural biology
Resource to the research community. This Resource, called ALS-ENABLE, is located at the Advanced Light
Source (ALS) in Berkeley, California. The team has two decades of experience operating macromolecular X-ray
crystallography (MX) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) beamlines, and more recently, an X-ray
footprinting mass spectrometry (XFMS) beamline. The team has worked closely together over the last 4 years
to create the ALS-ENABLE Resource, and many of the team members are cross-trained in the three X-ray
structural biology methods. During the 4 years we have implemented a transparent interface to the ALS structural
biology resources, and helped users pursue successful structure determination for both routine and challenging
problems. We have worked with a diverse user community, ranging from experts to new synchrotron users with
limited training in structural biology techniques. Where necessary we have guided users through the most
appropriate routes for answering their biological question. In this renewal application we propose to make several
changes to the Resource in response to recent changes in the field of structural biology, leverage a new high-
performance beamline (GEMINI), and incorporate the now mature synchrotron technique of X-ray footprinting
(XFMS).",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><Administrative Management><Automation><Biocompatible Materials><Biological><Biomaterials><COVID-19 virus><COVID19 virus><California><CoV-2><CoV2><Collection><Communities><Complex><Country><Coupling><Cryo-electron Microscopy><Cryoelectron Microscopy><Crystallization><Crystallographies><Crystallography><Data><Data Analyses><Data Analysis><Data Collection><Data Set><Development><Disease><Disorder><Drugs><Education and Outreach><Educational workshop><Effectiveness><Electron Cryomicroscopy><Ensure><Exclusion><Fluorescence Spectroscopy><Goals><Health><Human><IR/UV/Raman Spectroscopy><In Situ><Individual><Infrastructure><Instruction and Outreach><Internet><Investigation><Investigators><Journals><Life><Ligands><Light><Magazine><Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis><Mass Spectrometry><Mass Spectroscopy><Mass Spectrum><Mass Spectrum Analyses><Mass Spectrum Analysis><Medication><Methods><Modern Man><Office of Administrative Management><Peer Review><Performance><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Photoradiation><Productivity><Proteome><Publications><Raman Spectroscopy><Raman Spectrum Analysis><Raman imaging><Raman spectrometry><Research><Research Personnel><Research Resources><Researchers><Resources><Roentgen Rays><Route><SARS corona virus 2><SARS-CO-V2><SARS-COVID-2><SARS-CoV-2><SARS-CoV2><SARS-associated corona virus 2><SARS-associated coronavirus 2><SARS-coronavirus-2><SARS-related corona virus 2><SARS-related coronavirus 2><SARSCoV2><Scientific Publication><Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome CoV 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Corona Virus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus 2><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus 2><Severe acute respiratory syndrome associated corona virus 2><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2><Severe acute respiratory syndrome related corona virus 2><Single Crystal Diffraction><Site><Source><Structure><Synchrotrons><Techniques><Technology><Temperature><Testing><Training><Training and Outreach><Tutoring and Outreach><WWW><Work><Workshop><Wuhan coronavirus><X Ray Crystallographies><X-Radiation><X-Ray Crystallography><X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography><X-Ray Radiation><X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography><X-ray><Xray><Xray Crystallography><beamline><biologic><biological material><biological systems><coronavirus disease 2019 virus><coronavirus disease-19 virus><cryo-EM><cryoEM><cryogenic electron microscopy><data interpretation><data quality><design><designing><developmental><drug/agent><experience><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><flexibility><flexible><hCoV19><human disease><improved><instrument><macromolecular assembly><meeting><meetings><member><nCoV2><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new therapeutics><new therapy><next generation therapeutics><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><operation><operations><outreach><pathogen><programs><recruit><response><screening><screenings><small molecule><structural biology><success><tool><web><world wide web>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Infectious Diseases
Virtual Twin-Powered Rapid Development of Bioactive Multifunctional Dental Restoratives,Virtual Twin-Powered Rapid Development of Bioactive Multifunctional Dental Restoratives,"Summary
There is a global need to prioritize the development of a novel dental restoration that meets the criteria of being
long-lasting, easy to use, and accessible without complicated equipment. We aim to revolutionize dental care by
developing a cutting-edge platform for the rapid and precise creation of dental restoration materials. Our vision
is to tailor these materials to individual needs, adapting to the unique conditions of patients' oral environments.
Our innovative restorative system will include self-strengthening adhesives, bioactive fillers that respond to
biological signals, durable resins, and additives that provide new functions. Designed to be adaptable, this new
class of dental materials will be able to repair microcracks autonomously and prevent cariogenic biofilm.
Moreover, the easily applicable and durable restorative system will advance digital dentistry to a new level. Our
new approach integrates a physics-based model of testing and data-based simulations into the workflow of
material design and evaluation, this will drastically expedite the traditionally slow and costly route of material
development. Our ultimate goal is to introduce a novel operational platform in restorative dentistry, along with a
suite of multifunctional materials tailored for various dental treatments. Our diverse team, with expertise spanning
materials science, engineering, dentistry, and computational modeling, is committed to achieving this through a
three-pronged strategic approach. Aim 1 is to create a self-improving dental adhesive that enhances its bond
with the tooth substrate by facilitating mineralization at the interface. This auto-enhancing universal dental
adhesive (AUDA) will fill gaps between the tooth and adhesive, offering better adhesion than current products.
We will expedite AUDA development using hybrid modeling and simulation approaches (HMSA), which
incorporate data-driven multi-physics simulation techniques and create a virtual twin of the physical testing
environment. The performance of AUDA will undergo rigorous validation, including tests for bond strength to
extracted human teeth and durability under various challenges simulating human oral environments. Aim 2
focuses on crafting bioactive dental composites with self-healing and antimicrobial properties, achieved by
integrating innovative nanofillers. These composites that are designed to be compatible with existing dental
adhesives and AUDA will be validated for mechanical strength, bacterial inhibition, healing efficiency, and fatigue
life improvement. Aim 3 is to produce CAD/CAM restoratives optimized for digital dentistry, offering robust,
biocompatible materials with excellent aesthetics and bonding strength to teeth. Ultimately, our integration of
artificial intelligence and a virtual lab with the material development process in the physical lab will revolutionize
and individualize dental care. This platform will provide materials precisely tailored to meet diverse patient needs.
Successful completion of these Aims will generate a battery of novel bioactive multifunctional restorative
materials for precision placement and patients' needs. Its success will redefine dental restorative materials,
ushering in an era of personalized caries treatment.",<AI system><Acceleration><Acids><Address><Adhesions><Adhesives><Aging><Artificial Intelligence><Binding><Biocompatible Materials><Biological><Biomaterials><Bisphosphonates><Black><Black race><Caries><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Ceramics><Chemistry><Classification><Clinical><Clinical effectiveness><Composite Resins><Computer Models><Computer Reasoning><Computerized Models><Cues><Data><Dental><Dental Care><Dental Decay><Dental Enamel><Dental Materials><Dental Procedure><Dental Research><Dental Restorations><Dental caries><Dentin><Dentistry><Development><Enamel><Engineering><Ensure><Environment><Equipment><Esthetics><Evaluation><Fatigue><Filler><Formulation><Generalized Growth><Generations><Geometry><Goals><Growth><Human><Hybrids><Individual><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Laboratories><Lack of Energy><Learning><Life><Location><Machine Intelligence><Machine Learning><Mechanics><Microbial Biofilms><Minerals><Mission><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular Interaction><Odontogenesis><Oral><Patients><Performance><Physics><Plant Resins><Precision therapeutics><Procedures><Process><Property><Publications><Publishing><Research><Route><Salivary><Scientific Publication><Secure><Series><Sight><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Stimulus><System><Systematics><Techniques><Testing><Tissue Growth><Tooth><Tooth structure><Twin Multiple Birth><Twins><Validation><Vision><anti-microbial><anti-microbial agent><anti-microbial drug><antimicrobial><biofilm><biologic><biological material><biological signal transduction><biphosphonate><bisphosphonate><cariogenic biofilm><chemical bond><chemical property><chemical reaction><clinical relevance><clinically relevant><computational modeling><computational models><computer based models><computerized modeling><cost><dental adhesive><dental biofilm><dental development><dental service><design><designing><developmental><digital><diphosphonate><healing><improved><individual patient><innovate><innovation><innovative><machine based learning><manufacture><materials science><mechanic><mechanical><mechanical properties><mineralization><model-based simulation><models and simulation><nano><new approaches><novel><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><ontogeny><photocuring><physical property><plaque biofilm><precision therapies><precision treatment><prevent><preventing><remineralization><remote laboratory><repair><repaired><resin><response><restorative dentistry><restorative material><simulation><success><teeth><tooth decay><tooth enamel><tooth surface><user-friendly><validations><virtual><virtual lab><virtual laboratory><virtual library><visual function><zirconia><zirconium dioxide><zirconium oxide>,"Bioengineering; Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Disease; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence"
Self-sealing needle guide system for reliable hemodialysis,Self-sealing needle guide system for reliable hemodialysis,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than 500,000 Americans are living with end-stage kidney disease, and most of them require life-
sustaining hemodialysis treatments three times a week. Despite major improvements over the past several
decades, the average life expectancy for dialysis patients is still only 5-10 years. Moreover, the financial burden
is significant: dialysis patients comprise about 1% of those on Medicare, yet their care accounts for over 7% of
the Medicare budget. There is a pressing need to improve both patient outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of
hemodialysis treatment; the single most important problem facing patients being treated with hemodialysis is
safe and reliable cannulation. To address these challenges, we developed an implantable device that aims to
improve vascular access. The device features a 3D-printed titanium shell that accurately guides the hemodialysis
needle to the correct insertion point, while a titanium-nitride coated valve stops bleeding immediately upon
needle removal. This new cutting-edge device minimizes the risks for infection, incorrect needle placement, and
excessive bleeding, making hemodialysis treatments safer, more efficient, and easier to administer. In this phase-
I SBIR proposal, we will use state-of-the-art materials and engineering techniques to refine the manufacturability
and operational parameters of our device. Then through a large animal preclinical study, we will evaluate device
functionality, tissue integration, inflammatory profile as well as infection and bleeding risks. Our results will pave
the way for a comprehensive large-scale GLP-certified animal study and a first-in-human trial. Our device has
the potential to be a disruptive technology in nephrology, improve the quality of life for dialysis patients, and
possibly facilitate wider adoption of home-based hemodialysis treatments.","<3-D print><3-D printer><3D Print><3D printer><3D printing><AV fistula><Abscission><Address><Adoption><Adverse Experience><Adverse event><American><Animal Experiments><Animals><Arteriovenous Aneurysm><Arteriovenous fistula><Biocompatible Materials><Biomaterials><Bleeding><Blood><Blood Circulation><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Blood Vessels><Bloodstream><Body Tissues><Budgets><Cannulations><Caring><Cause of Death><Certification><Clinical><Clinical Management><Clinical Trials><Clotting><Coagulation><Coagulation Process><Devices><Dialysis><Dialysis patients><Dialysis procedure><Dimensions><Distress><ESRD><Elasticity><End stage renal failure><End-Stage Kidney Disease><End-Stage Renal Disease><Engineering><Ensure><Event><Excision><Extirpation><FDA approved><Failure><Financial Hardship><Fistula><Focal Infection><Future><Geometry><Health Care Costs><Health Care Systems><Health Costs><Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18><Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18><Healthcare Costs><Healthcare Systems><Hematoma><Hemodialyses><Hemodialysis><Hemorrhage><Hemostasis><Hemostatic function><History><Home><Home Hemodialyses><Home Hemodialysis><Home Renal Dialysis><Immune response><Immunological response><Implant><Improve Access><Infection><Inflammation><Inflammatory><Legal patent><Life><Life Expectancy><Measures><Medical><Medicare><Methods><Modeling><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Muscle><Muscle Tissue><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Needles><Nephrology><Outcome><Ovine><Ovis><Patents><Patient outcome><Patient-Centered Outcomes><Patient-Focused Outcomes><Patients><Performance><Phase><Population><Position><Positioning Attribute><Procedures><Process><Production><Public Health><QOL><Quality Control><Quality of life><Recording of previous events><Removal><Risk><SBIR><Safety><Serious Adverse Event><Severe Adverse Event><Sheep><Site><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Specific qualifier value><Specified><Structure><Surface><Surgical Removal><System><Techniques><Technology><Testing><Ti element><Time><Tissues><Titanium><Title 18><United States National Institutes of Health><Weight><Withdrawal><animal experiment><biological material><biomedical implant><blood loss><cost><cost effectiveness><design><designing><dialysis therapy><experimental animal><experimental animals><financial adversity><financial burden><financial distress><financial insecurity><financial strain><financial stress><first in man><first-in-human><good laboratory practice><health insurance for disabled><histories><homes><host response><immune system response><immunoresponse><implant device><implantable device><improved><in silico><in vivo><indwelling device><infection localized><infection risk><injured><innovate><innovation><innovative><local infection><manufacturability><manufacture><mortality><muscular><ovine animal model><ovine model><pain reduction><patient oriented outcomes><pre-clinical><pre-clinical study><preclinical><preclinical study><pressure><reduce pain><resection><risk minimization><seal><serious adverse experience><serious adverse reaction><sheep model><simulation><standard of care><subcutaneous><subdermal><three dimensional printing><vascular><weights>",Aging; Assistive Technology; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Health Services; Infectious Diseases; Kidney Disease
"Recapitulating the native tendon microenvironment through design of degradable, anisotropic engineered extracellular matrices","Recapitulating the native tendon microenvironment through design of degradable, anisotropic engineered extracellular matrices","Project Summary
Following injury and repair, tendons rarely exhibit full restoration of function and reinjuries are prominent. Poor
clinical outcomes are due to deposition of disorganized scar tissue rather than tissue with the anisotropic,
hierarchical structure as in uninjured tendon. Prior work has demonstrated that anisotropic materials as
scaffolds to guide cells promote expression of tenogenic markers and provide a template for cell orientation,
showing promise for promoting regenerative healing. However, biomaterials used in these studies lack
tunability in biophysical and biochemical cues critical for fully recapitulating the native tendon environment in
an engineered extracellular matrix (eECM) and translation of the eECM to in vivo applications. To address
these limitations, we have developed a novel approach to fabricate anisotropic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
hydrogel-based eECM to promote the alignment of human tenocytes. These anisotropic hydrogels are formed
using a two-stage polymerization that eliminates complications of using additives or complex processing
techniques to introduce anisotropy and enables scaling of the biomaterial without compromising material
properties. In the first stage, a network is formed via a Michael-addition reaction of 4-arm PEG-maleimide and
dicysteine peptides. The network is strained to introduce anisotropy, followed by a secondary thiol-ene
photocrosslinking of remaining peptide thiols and 8-arm PEG-norbornene to retain strain-induced alignment.
Notably, the eECM includes MMP-degradable crosslinks to balance structural cues and matrix remodeling. We
propose herein that hydrogel-mediated anisotropic guidance and biochemical cues to tenocytes in balance with
hydrogel remodeling will orchestrate native-like tendon deposition. In Aim 1, material properties of anisotropic
eECM will be characterized. Mechanical properties will be tested via tensile testing parallel and perpendicular
to alignment. Temporal retention of alignment as a function of MMP-mediated degradation will be analyzed via
wide angle x-ray diffraction. Human tenocytes will be seeded in the eECM and cell and matrix anisotropy will
be analyzed using microscopy. Matrix deposition will be analyzed by comparing ratios and organization of type
I to type III collagen deposition and gene expression of scleraxis, tenomodulin, mohawk, and ⍺SMA as
measures of regenerative versus fibrotic characteristics. Isotropic hydrogels will be used as controls with
analysis over 14 days in vitro. In Aim 2, tenocyte gene expression profiles induced by anisotropic, degradable
PEG hydrogel-based eECM will be comprehensively analyzed via RNAseq. Differential gene expression will be
assessed on day 14 samples to compare gene profiles between eECM groups and freshly isolated cells from
healthy and fibrotic tendons. Completing these aims will provide insight into materials design parameters for
eECM to develop a pro-regenerative environment for tenocytes. The hydrogels are expected to promote
alignment and suppress fibrosis, providing a platform for translating eECM as an effective 3D scaffold in
tendon repair and other aligned musculoskeletal tissues such as muscle.","<1,2-Ethanediol><2-Hydroxyethanol><3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><3D cell culture><3D culture><Address><Anisotropy><Biochemical><Biocompatible Materials><Biological><Biomaterials><Biophysics><Body Tissues><Cell Body><Cell Isolation><Cell Segregation><Cell Separation><Cell Separation Technology><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cells><Characteristics><Cicatrix><Clinical><Collagen Type I><Collagen Type III><Complex><Cues><Data><Deposit><Deposition><Differential Gene Expression><Dihydroxyethanes><ECM><Electrospinning><Encapsulated><Engineering><Environment><Equilibrium><Ethanediols><Ethylene Glycols><Exhibits><Expression Signature><Extracellular Matrix><Fiber><Fibrosis><Gene Expression><Gene Expression Profile><Genes><Genetic Markers><Human><Hydrogels><In Vitro><Injury><Knowledge><Libraries><MMPs><Maleimides><Matrix Metalloproteinases><Measures><Mediating><Mercaptans><Mercapto Compounds><Microscopy><Modern Man><Modulus><Monitor><Monoethylene Glycol><Muscle><Muscle Tissue><Musculoskeletal><Non-Polyadenylated RNA><Outcome><Peptides><Persons><Phenotype><Polymers><Property><RNA><RNA Gene Products><RNA Seq><RNA sequencing><RNAseq><Reaction><Research><Ribonucleic Acid><Role><Sampling><Scars><Structure><Sulfhydryl Compounds><Techniques><Tendon Injuries><Tendon structure><Tendons><Testing><Thiols><Tissue Engineering><Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression><Tissue-Specific Gene Expression><Tissues><Translating><Translations><Transmission><Type 1 Collagen><Up-Regulation><Upregulation><Work><X ray diffraction><X ray diffraction analysis><Xray diffraction><arm><balance><balance function><bioengineered tissue><biologic><biological material><biophysical foundation><biophysical principles><biophysical sciences><cell sorting><crosslink><design><designing><engineered tissue><ethylene glycol><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><fabrication><functional restoration><gene biomarker><gene expression biomarker><gene expression pattern><gene expression signature><gene marker><gene signature biomarker><genetic biomarker><in vivo><injuries><injury and repair><insight><mechanical properties><muscular><nanocrystal><new approaches><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><polymer><polymeric><polymerization><programs><regeneration healing><regenerative><regenerative healing><repair><repaired><restoration><restore function><restore functionality><restore lost function><scaffold><scaffolding><scleraxis><screening><screenings><social role><sulfhydryl group><three dimensional><three dimensional cell culture><transcriptional profile><transcriptional signature><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing><translation><transmission process>",Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Genetics; Regenerative Medicine
Investigation of cold plasma for healing alcohol-induced tissue injury,Investigation of cold plasma for healing alcohol-induced tissue injury,"Abstract:
 Binge drinking of alcohol beverages hinders tissue repair and amplifies the susceptibility to infection. The
prevalence as well as the risks associated with binge drinking poses a significant concern in the United States.
Binge drinking impairs the three key phases of wound healing: inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling.
Specifically, during the inflammation phase, binge drinking diminishes the function of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
neutrophils, and macrophages, thus compromising the innate immune system's ability to combat pathogens. The
efficacy of current wound healing methods is constrained by the vulnerability to wound infection which is
exacerbated by concurrent binge drinking. Cold Plasma (CP) has recently gained substantial attention in clinical
practice due to its regenerative properties and its ability to prevent infection. Previous studies have shown that
CP treatment is involved in the wound healing mediated by the Nrf2 pathway and Wnt/β‑catenin signaling
pathway.
 Taken these solid premises together, we hypothesize that CP will improve impaired wound healing and
mitigate the increased vulnerability to infection caused by binge drinking. To substantiate these hypotheses, we
have proposed two following specific aims using F344 rat model and human skin organoid model, respectively.
Aim 1 is to characterize wound healing properties of CP in F344 rats following binge exposure to alcohol.
This aim is to examine wound closure properties of CP and to reveal molecular mechanisms underlying CP
modulation of wound healing in binge EtOH intoxicated F344 rats. Aim 2 is to generate an in-vitro wound
healing model using hiPSC derived skin organoids and to investigate the potential wound healing
properties of CP in these skin organoids given binge level of EtOH. This aim represents the translational
aspect of our studies. We first will develop and characterize 3D skin organoids using human induced pluripotent
stem cells (hiPSC) and then identify the potential wound healing properties of CP in alcohol-treated human skin
organoids. In addition, we will study molecular mechanisms and signal pathways underlying CP modulation of
wound healing in alcohol treated skin organoids using both immunofluorescence and gene expression analysis.
 These studies are highly significant because 1) we are to demonstrate the medical use of CP in wound healing
associated with EtOH intoxication, and 2) we are to address the translational value of the proposed studies using
F344 rat model and human culture of skin organoids. Successful completion of this small R03 grant award will
provide valuable therapeutic clues in CP modulation of the wound healing during EtOH intoxication. The study
outcomes shall shift the paradigms regarding the interplay between wound healing properties of CP and alcohol-
induced impairment of wound healing, eventually leading to clinical application of CP in wound healing during
EtOH intoxication. We expect a full R01 project to be developed in conclusion of this small R03 project.","<(TNF)-α><3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><Abbreviations><Absolute ethanol><Active Oxygen><Address><Afferent

Immunomodulatory biomaterial to enhancing T-cell responses to triple negative breast cancer,Immunomodulatory biomaterial to enhancing T-cell responses to triple negative breast cancer,"Project Summary
Deaths from solid tumors vastly outnumber deaths from hematopoietic cancers. Yet progress in
immunotherapies for solid tumors is well behind those for lymphoma. CAR-T cell therapies and
engineered T cells have become revolutionary approaches for hematopoietic cancers, but their
potential for solid tumors is yet to be realized. Significant challenges hinder the potential of
immune therapies in solid tumors, including insufficient activation and eventual exhaustion of
effector T cells; and suppression of T cell effector responses in the tumor microenvironment. In
this proposal we consider these hurdles and offer a biomaterial solution that overcomes them.
This proposal is significant in facilitating endogenous T cells to fight solid tumors. Surgery is a
major treatment modality for both invasive and in situ tumors, but at this time, there are no specific
immunotherapies initiated at the time of surgery; they all start days to weeks later. Our proposal
is significant for offering a way to start treatments early, right at the time of initial surgery. Here
our synthetic scaffold, SymphNode can be injected at the time of biopsy or surgery not to only
recruit and active tumor-experienced local immune cells but also to suppress the inhibitory cells
created by tumor cells. Our long-term goal is to develop this bioengineered, locally injected,
“synthetic lymph node” into a therapy for human tumors.",<4T1><Abscopal effect><Adjuvant><Adverse effects><Affect><Alginates><Antibodies><Autoimmune><Biocompatible Materials><Biologic

Temperature changes and inflammatory response in pulpal and gingival tissues surrounding dental restorative treatments performed using blue and red wavelengths: an in vivo and ex vivo study,Temperature changes and inflammatory response in pulpal and gingival tissues surrounding dental restorative treatments performed using blue and red wavelengths: an in vivo and ex vivo study,"ABSTRACT
This K23 application is to support the research and career development of Dr. Dayane Oliveira by providing her
with an intensive mentored experience in order for her to complete the transition to an independent clinician-
scientist with a patient-centered research program focused on an unexplored area of designing and
implementing novel dental biomaterials using red light in their application. Light-cured materials revolutionized
dentistry as they allowed to control the setting of the materials in a timely manner simply upon light exposure.
The use of light-cured materials in dentistry was made possible by adding photoinitiators to the composition of
dental materials. Although blue light has been routinely used to cure dental restorative materials for over 50
years, there are still potential risks to dental patients. These risks include gingiva burn/recession and pulp
inflammation that can lead to necrosis in more severe situations caused/induced by the heat generated by this
short wavelength. As well as the direct effects on the gingival and pulpal cells, including the induction of
irreversible reactive oxygen species levels imbalance, damage to the mitochondrial DNA, and collagen
degradation. On the other hand, long wavelengths (such as red light) are known to induce less heat and have
opposing effects on cellular function, reducing inflammation and increasing cell proliferation. Although the blue-
light hazards in dentistry are well known, little can be done as to date as there were no photoinitiators capable
of absorbing longer wavelengths. Our group has overcome this hurdle by synthesizing a dental photoinitiator
activated by red light, thus opening the door for red light to be used in restorative dental procedures. Our in vitro
preliminary data demonstrate the positive effects of red light on temperature during the curing process as well
as on fibroblast and odontoblast viability and their initial signaling responses. Thus, as the next step in filling this
clinical need, we here propose to conduct an exploratory Phase 1 medical device study combined with a
further ex vivo mechanistic study as the next logical steps in translating this improved clinical care from
laboratory findings to clinical practice. Our central hypothesis is that longer wavelengths will mitigate pulpal
and gingival damage during dental restorative procedures. The results of this work will lay the groundwork to
support a future medical device Phase 2 study application in order to achieve the long-term goal of using red
light as a new strategy for light-curing in Dentistry. Thus, ensuring a safer and more effective treatment strategy
to improve oral health. Dr. Oliveira has established a multi-disciplinary mentoring team to provide expertise in
translational research training and mentorship in her career development. A training plan including didactic,
hands-on, and career development experiences has been put forth to enable this transition together with this
strong research plan.",<Active Oxygen><Alkaline Phosphatase><Amalgam><Anti-Inflammatories><Anti-Inflammatory Agents><Anti-inflammatory><Area><Award><Biocompatible Materials><Biological><Biomaterials><Body Tissues><Buccal Cavity><Buccal Cavity Head and Neck><Caries><Cavitas Oris><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Death><Cell Function><Cell Growth in Number><Cell Multiplication><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Proliferation><Cell Signaling><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Cellular Proliferation><Cellular Stress><Cellular Stress Response><Chemotactic Cytokines><Classification><Clinical><Collagen><Collagen Type I><Composite Resins><Custom><Data><Dental><Dental Care><Dental Decay><Dental Materials><Dental Procedure><Dental Pulp><Dental Restorations><Dental caries><Dentistry><Development and Research><Devices><Double-Blind Method><Double-Blind Study><Double-Blinded><Double-Masked Method><Double-Masked Study><ECM><EDRF Synthase><Endothelium-Derived Growth Factor Synthase><Ensure><Environment><Exposure to><Extracellular Matrix><Fibroblasts><Fingerprint><Food and Drug Administration><Future><Generalized Growth><Generations><Gingiva><Gingival><Goals><Growth><Guanylyl Cyclase-Activating Factor Synthase><Health><Homologous Chemotactic Cytokines><Human><Immune><Immunes><Immunochemical Immunologic><Immunologic><Immunological><Immunologically><Immunologics><In Vitro><Inflammation><Inflammatory Response><Intercrines><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><K23 Award><K23 Mechanism><K23 Program><Lab Findings><Laboratory Finding><Legal patent><Light><Maintenance><Measures><Medical Device><Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award><Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23)><Mentors><Mentorship><Mercury Compounds><Mitochondrial DNA><Modeling><Modern Man><Mouth><NO Synthase><Necrosis><Necrotic><Nitric Oxide Synthase><Nitric-Oxide Synthetase><Odontoblasts><Oral cavity><Oral health><Outcome><Oxygen Radicals><Patents><Patients><Persons><Phase><Photoradiation><Pro-Oxidants><Procedures><Process><Publishing><R & D><R&D><Randomized><Reactive Oxygen Species><Research><Research Support><Research Training><Risk><SIS cytokines><Safety><Scientist><Side><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Subcellular Process><Systematics><Temperature><Tissue Growth><Tissues><Training><Translating><Translational Research><Translational Science><Type 1 Collagen><USFDA><United States Food and Drug Administration><Work><Wound Repair><absorption><alkaline phosphomonoesterase><anthropogenesis><anthropogenic><biologic><biological material><biological signal transduction><career development><cell stress><chemoattractant cytokine><chemokine><clinical applicability><clinical application><clinical care><clinical practice><compare treatment><customs><cytokine><dental health><dental service><design><designing><effective therapy><effective treatment><experience><glycerophosphatase><hazard><improved><in vivo><light effects><mercury release><mtDNA><multidisciplinary><necrocytosis><novel><ontogeny><patient centered><patient oriented><phase 2 study><phase II study><programs><pulp><randomisation><randomization><randomly assigned><research and development><response><restorative dentistry><restorative material><restorative treatment><soft tissue><tooth decay><translation research><translational investigation><treatment comparison><treatment strategy><wound healing><wound recovery><wound resolution>,"Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Disease"
Optimizing A Miniaturized and Integrated Continuous Glucose Monitoring Platform,Optimizing A Miniaturized and Integrated Continuous Glucose Monitoring Platform,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goal of this project is to develop a scalable, user-friendly, continuous glucose monitoring
(CGM) system for better diabetes management. IMS has developed the world's smallest
electrochemical analyte sensing platform based on an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
using Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology. This design offers some unique
advantages due to its active digital sensor (compared to passive analog sensors in current leading
CGMs) including extreme miniaturization, on-chip integration of multiple sensors and processing
electronics, improvement in signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio (thus improving hypoglycemia accuracy), and
on-chip temperature calibration (improve accuracy, reliability by confirming the sensor is in the tissue,
and performing on-site temperature calibration during sickness, exercise, and sleep). Moreover, the
system uses extremely scalable semiconductor and flexible electronics manufacturing methods,
increasing lot sizes by > 50,000x (simplifying factory calibration) and reducing cost (improving
affordability and broadening usage). The proposed system is named CGM+ since it goes beyond just
glucose monitoring (v1 measures glucose and temperature, v2 will measure glucose, ketones,
temperature, and pH). Hence, the design is highly innovative.
We have demonstrated the function of the CGM+ platform in humans in a First-In-Human (FIH)
feasibility study in Phase II. Recently, we verified the feasibility of system operation for 14 days in a
second human study (ongoing).
Our objective in this CRP grant is to optimize the manufacturing and the quality framework to enable
larger human studies, paving the way towards enabling an FDA IDE for approval trials.
This work is significant as it will catalyze the commercialization of the first CGM+ system capable of
the smallest needle insertion (28-gauge needle) that can work for a long time (>14 days) with factory
calibration (no finger sticks). After the first approval, this system can be extended to include other
analytes (e.g., ketones, insulin, glucagon) without increasing its size, owing to the on-chip integration
of multiple sensors.
The team includes original inventors of the core technology from the California Institute of Technology
(Dr. Nazari, Dr. Rahman, Mr. Sencan), a seasoned and respected researcher in electrochemical sensor
technology (Bill Van Antwerp, former CSO of Medtronic MiniMed), regulatory and IP expert (John
Heithaus, JD), commercialization expert (Mr. Paul Strasma, former CEO of Capillary Biomedical which
was recently acquired by Tandem Diabetes), clinical expert (Dr. Alan Marcus, MD; former Chief Medical
Officer of Medtronic Diabetes), and a biosensors and biomaterials expert (Dr. Natalie Wisniewski, Ph.D.,
former CTO of Profusa, Inc.).",<Abscission><Acceleration><Address><Adoption><Affect><Antidiabetic Hormone><Biochemistry><Biocompatible Materials><Biological Chemistry><Biomaterials><Biosensor><Blood capillaries><Bluetooth><Body Tissues><Businesses><Calibration><California><Cause of Death><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Phone><Cell Signaling><Cellular Phone><Cellular Telephone><Chronic Disease><Chronic Illness><Clinic><Clinical><Clinical Evaluation><Clinical Testing><Clinical Trials><Coin><Compensation><Continuous Glucose Monitor><D-Glucose><Data><Data Bases><Databases><Dedications><Devices><Dextrose><Diabetes Mellitus><Doctor of Philosophy><Economics><Electrodes><Electronics><Engineering><Enzyme Gene><Enzymes><Excision><Exercise><Extirpation><Family suidae><Feasibility Studies><Feedback><Filament><Fingers><Foreign Bodies><Friends><Glucagon><Glucose><Glukagon><Goals><Grain><Grant><HG-Factor><Hair><Human><Humulin R><Hydrogels><Hyperglycemic-Glycogenolytic Factor><Hypoglycemia><In Situ><Industry><Inflammation><Insulin><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigators><Ketones><Leanness><Legal patent><Length of Life><Letters><Longevity><Marketing><Measures><Medical><Methods><Miniaturisations><Miniaturization><Mission><Mobile Phones><Modern Man><Modernization><Names><Nanotechnology><Needles><Noise><Notification><Novolin R><Pain Free><Patents><Patients><Performance><Persons><Ph.D.><PhD><Phase><Pigs><Privatization><Process><Regular Insulin><Removal><Research Personnel><Researchers><Rice><Scientist><Seasons><Secure><Semiconductors><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Site><Skin><Skin Tissue><Sleep><Sterilization><Suidae><Surgical Removal><Swine><System><Techniques><Technology><Temperature><Testing><Texture><Thinness><Time><Tissues><Traction><Visualization><Weight><Work><analog><biocompatibility><biological material><biological sensor><biological signal transduction><biomaterial compatibility><capillary><catalyst><chronic disorder><clinical test><commercialization><continuous blood glucose monitor><continuous blood sugar monitor><continuous glucose measurement><continuous sugar monitor><cost><cutaneous tissue><data base><data streams><design><designing><diabetes><diabetes management><diabetes mellitus management><diabetic management><digital><disability><economic><electronic><electronic device><fabrication><first in man><first-in-human><flex circuit><flexibility><flexible><flexible electronics><glucometer><glucose meter><glucose monitor><glycemic control><human study><hypoglycemic><hypoglycemic episodes><iPhone><improved><in vivo><innovate><innovation><innovative><integrated circuit><integrated circuits><manufacture><manufacturing test><materials science><metal oxide><miniaturize><miniaturized><multidisciplinary><name><named><naming><nano><nano tech><nano technology><nano-technological><nanotech><nanotechnological><operation><operations><patient population><porcine><printed circuit board><research clinical testing><resection><response><sensing technology><sensor><sensor technology><sensor-based technology><service providers><skin irritation><smart phone><smartphone><subcutaneous><subdermal><suid><user-friendly><wearable><wearable device><wearable electronics><wearable system><wearable technology><wearable tool><wearables><weights><wireless communication>,Autoimmune Disease; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Diabetes

Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is characterized by a decline in ovarian function resulting in infertility and
reduced ovarian hormone production. Globally, the rate of POI is approximately 3.5% resulting in
~138,250,000 women experiencing subfertility or infertility. Consequently, fertility preservation and restoration
are a priority among patients with POI and individuals who desire children later in their reproductive lifespan.
However, many limitations to the current fertility preservation and restoration options result in short hormonal
functionality of transplanted ovarian tissue, low live birth rates, and low numbers of good-quality oocytes for in
vitro maturation. Therefore, the development of novel technologies and methodologies for the advancement of
reproductive science is imperative. Our main goal through this work is to elucidate matrisome-dependent
mechanisms that contribute to folliculogenesis while also designing a defined biomaterial that improves follicle
growth and oocyte quality in vitro. We will accomplish this through the interrogation of Elastin Microfibril
Interface-located protein 1’s (EMILIN1) role in folliculogenesis (Aim 1) and by engineering a biomaterial that
increases follicle growth and oocyte quality (Aim 2). Our preliminary studies demonstrate our ability to
investigate matrisome-dependent cues in vitro using decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) hydrogels
derived from bovine ovarian tissue. We have shown that hydrogels with a high quantity of EMILIN1 increase
murine follicle diameter in vitro compared to hydrogels with a low quantity of EMILIN1. This effect can be
rescued with the addition of rhEMILIN1. Importantly, this effect can only be observed when follicles are cultured
in dECM and EMILIN1 had no effect on growth when added to a biologically inert hydrogel, alginate. Therefore,
we will elucidate the mechanism by which EMILIN1 increases follicle growth by performing bulk-RNA
sequencing on murine follicles grown in the presence or absence of EMILIN1 in dECM and interrogating the
signaling pathways associated with EMILIN1. Then, we will engineer a hydrogel of defined matrisome
composition to recapitulate the follicle growth dynamics observed in dECM hydrogels with an abundance of
EMILIN1. To do this, we will perform a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and subsequent unbiased proteomics to
define matrisome proteins that EMILIN1 associates with. We will then use this list of proteins to design an ECM
hydrogel for ovarian follicle culture that increases follicle growth and oocyte quality via an EMILIN1-driven
mechanism. Taken together, these aims will expand our understanding of the role of EMILIN1 in
folliculogenesis, advise future work in designing advanced biomaterials for follicle culture, and lead to future
fertility preservation and restoration options. Finally, this research will be influential to the greater scientific
community by expanding our technical repertoire for studying matrisome-dependent biochemical cues within
other organ systems.",<0-11 years old><Alginates><Antral><Assay><Bioassay><Bioavailability><Biochemical><Biocompatible Materials><Biological><Biological Assay><Biological Availability><Biological Mimetics><Biomaterials><Biomimetic Materials><Biomimetics><Bioprosthesis><Bioprosthesis device><Bioprosthetic><Birth Rate><Body System><Body Tissues><Bovine Species><Cancer Survivor><Cancer Treatment><Cannot achieve a pregnancy><Cattle><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Growth in Number><Cell Multiplication><Cell Proliferation><Cell Signaling><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cellular Proliferation><Child><Child Youth><Children (0-21)><Co-Immunoprecipitations><Communities><Cryofixation><Cryopreservation><Cryopreserved Tissue><Cues><Data><Development><Diameter><Difficulty conceiving><ECM><EMILIN Protein><Elastin Microfibril Interface Located Protein><Elastin Microfibril Interface-Located Protein 1><Elastin Microfibril Interfacer 1><Endocrine><Endocrine Gland Secretion><Engineering><Extracellular Matrix><Family suidae><Fecundability><Fecundity><Fertility><Foundations><Future><Generalized Growth><Generations><Glycoproteins><Goals><Growing Follicle><Growth><Hormonal><Hormones><Human><Hydrogels><Image><Implant><In Vitro><Individual><Infertility><Influentials><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Length of Life><Live Birth><Longevity><Malignant Neoplasm Therapy><Malignant Neoplasm Treatment><Mediating><Methodology><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Molecular><Murine><Mus><Organ System><Ovarian><Ovarian Follicle><Ovarian Tissue><Ovarian hormone><Ovarian tissue cryopreservation><Ovary><Patients><Phenotype><Physiologic Availability><Pigs><Population><Premature ovarian insufficiency><Prevalence><Primordial Follicle><Process><Production><Proliferating><Protein Cleavage><Proteins><Proteolysis><Proteomics><RNA Seq><RNA sequencing><RNAseq><Regulation><Reproductive Sciences><Reproductive Technology><Research><Reverse engineering><Role><Signal Pathway><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Suidae><Swine><TGF-Beta 1><TGF-Beta1><TGFB><TGFB1><TGFB1 gene><Testing><Therapeutic Hormone><Tissue Growth><Tissue Transplantation><Tissues><Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1><United States><Woman><Work><anti-cancer therapy><biologic><biological material><biological signal transduction><bovid><bovine><cancer therapy><cancer-directed therapy><cold preservation><cold storage><cow><design><designing><developmental><egg><egg quality><experience><fertility cessation><fertility improvement><fertility loss><fertility preservation><folliculogenesis><global gene expression><global transcription profile><granulosa cell><imaging><improve fertility><improved><in vivo><increase fertility><infertile><innovate><innovation><innovative><kids><life span><lifespan><new technology><novel technologies><ontogeny><oocyte quality><ovarian follicular pool><ovarian tissue freezing><ovarian transplant><ovarian transplantation><ovary transplant><ovary transplantation><porcine><post-transplant><post-transplantation><posttransplant><posttransplantation><preserve fertility><primary infertility><primary ovarian insufficiency><reproductive><reproductive function><restoration><social role><subfertility><suid><transcriptome><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing><transforming growth factor beta1><youngster>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Contraception/Reproduction; Infertility; Women's Health Research
Atherosclerosis assay development for drug efficacy and cytotoxicity screening,Atherosclerosis assay development for drug efficacy and cytotoxicity screening,"Project Summary
Cardiovascular disease, primarily driven by atherosclerosis, is the leading cause of death in the U.S. The recent
FDA Modernization Act 2.0 allows the use of alternatives to animal models in drug testing, spurring the
development of advanced in vitro models like cell-based assays and artificial intelligence-based systems to
streamline drug development processes. However, current atherosclerosis assays, mostly based on simple 2D cell
cultures, don't adequately replicate the disease's complexity, potentially leading to inaccurate results.
To address this issue, Endomimetics has developed innovative nanomatrix cell sheet technology and “cell-as-
glue” approach as well as formulated novel atherosclerotic inducing mediums, which can produce an in vitro 3D
nanomatrix vascular sheet (VS) and a novel 3D in vitro atherosclerosis model - nanomatrix vascular sheet with
atherosclerosis (VSA).
Therefore, our aim is to revolutionize the field by developing an automated, highly precise approach for fabricating
VS and VSA. This advancement will enable the use of VS and VSA in creating functional assays for efficient, high-
throughput drug testing in a 3D human atherosclerosis environment and allow for the evaluation of both the efficacy
and cytotoxicity of drugs across extensive sample sizes, while minimizing biological variability. Such an initiative,
unprecedented in its scope and precision, has not yet been achieved in any existing in vitro atherosclerosis assays.
Specifically, we will develop two innovative assays integrating BODIPY staining and ELISA methods, aimed at
determining the efficacy of atherosclerosis treatments by their capacity to suppress foam cell formation and curtail
inflammatory cytokine production.
Established anti-atherosclerosis and anti-inflammatory compounds will serve as positive controls, validating the
accuracy of the assays in detecting reductions in both foam cell formation and cytokine secretion. Simultaneously,
negative controls will be employed to evaluate assay specificity, ensuring the precision of our results, and
eliminating the potential for false positives.
To demonstrate the feasibility of our assays in evaluating new atherosclerosis therapeutics, we will assess the
efficacy of two histone deacetylases inhibitors at various doses using our assays. Additionally, we will develop
and execute cytotoxicity-based assays to investigate the safety of these inhibitors.","<3-D><3-D modeling><3-Dimensional><3D><3D cell culture><3D culture><3D modeling><ACT2><AI based model><AI model><AI system><AT744.1><Act-2><Address><Advanced Development><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Animals><Anti-Inflammatories><Anti-Inflammatory Agents><Anti-inflammatory><Architecture><Arterial Fatty Streak><Arterial Fatty Streaks><Arteries><Artificial Intelligence><Assay><Atheroma><Atheromatous><Atheromatous degeneration><Atheromatous plaque><Atherosclerosis><Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease><Attention><BODIPY><Bioassay><Biocompatible Materials><Biological><Biological Assay><Biomaterials><Blood Vessels><Body Tissues><CCL4><CCL4 gene><CSIF><CSIF-10><Cardiac Diseases><Cardiac Disorders><Cardiovascular Diseases><Cause of Death><Cell Body><Cell Culture System><Cell Culture Techniques><Cell Growth in Number><Cell Multiplication><Cell Proliferation><Cells><Cellular Proliferation><Chemokine (C-C Motif) Ligand 4><Chemokine, CC Motif, Ligand 4><Cholesterol><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Clinical Trials><Colchicine><Complex><Computer Reasoning><Cytokine Synthesis Inhibitory Factor><Data><Development><Disease><Disorder><Disparities><Disparity><Dose><Drug Evaluation><Drug Evaluation Studies><Drug toxicity><Drugs><ELISA><Endothelial Cells><Engineering / Architecture><Ensure><Environment><Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay><Ethics><Evaluation><Foam Cells><Future><Gene Expression><Genetic Diversity><Genetic Variation><Glues><HDAC><HDAC Agent><HDAC Proteins><HDAC inhibitor><HDAC6><HDAC6 gene><Heart Diseases><Hepatic Cells><Hepatic Parenchymal Cell><Hepatocyte><High Throughput Assay><Histone Deacetylase><Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor><Histone deacetylase inhibition><Human><IL-10><IL10><IL10A><Immune Activation 2><In Vitro><Inflammatory><Interleukin 10 Precursor><Interleukin-10><Investigation><KIAA0901><Legal patent><Leiomyocyte><Licensing><Liver Cells><Lytotoxicity><MIP1B><MIP1B1><Machine Intelligence><Macrophage><Macrophage Inflammatory Protein 1-Beta><Medication><Methods><Modeling><Modern Man><Modernization><Mφ><Organoids><Patents><Pathogenesis><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phosphate Buffer><Play><Process><Production><Publishing><Rapamune><Rapamycin><Regulation><Reliability of Results><Reproducibility><Research><Role><SCYA4><Safety><Saline><Saline Solution><Sample Size><Sirolimus><Small Inducible Cytokine A4><Smooth Muscle Cells><Smooth Muscle Myocytes><Smooth Muscle Tissue Cell><Specificity><Speed><Staining method><Stains><Standardization><Structure><System><Techniques><Technology><Therapeutic><Tissues><United States><artificial intelligence model><artificial intelligence-based model><assay development><assess effectiveness><atheromatosis><atherosclerosis plaque><atherosclerotic disease><atherosclerotic lesions><atherosclerotic plaque><atherosclerotic vascular disease><bio-printing><biologic><biological material><bioprinting><cardiovascular disorder><cell culture><cell cultures><cost effective><cytokine><cytotoxicity><determine effectiveness><determine efficacy><developmental><driving force><drug detection><drug development><drug efficacy><drug safety><drug testing><drug/agent><effective therapy><effective treatment><effectiveness assessment><effectiveness evaluation><efficacy analysis><efficacy assessment><efficacy determination><efficacy evaluation><efficacy examination><empowerment><enzyme linked immunoassay><ethical><evaluate effectiveness><evaluate efficacy><examine effectiveness><examine efficacy><fabrication><heart disorder><high throughput screening><histone deacetylase 6><improved><in vitro Assay><in vitro Model><in vivo><in vivo Model><inhibitor><innovate><innovation><innovative><medication safety><model of animal><nano><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new therapeutics><new therapy><next generation therapeutics><novel><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><pharmaceutical safety><pre-clinical research><preclinical research><response><scale up><screening><screenings><social role><therapeutic candidate><three dimensional><three dimensional cell culture><three-dimensional modeling><vascular><vulnerable plaque>",Aging; Atherosclerosis; Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Cardiovascular
A Bio-orthogonal Targeting System for Precision Drug Delivery to Vascular Endothelium in Transplanted Organs,A Bio-orthogonal Targeting System for Precision Drug Delivery to Vascular Endothelium in Transplanted Organs,"Project Summary and Abstract.
The viability of a transplanted organ and the patient’s health are inherently limited by the burdens of
immunosuppressive therapy, which must be used for the duration of the patient’s life. Systemic administration
of these immunosuppressive agents increases the incidence of infectious disease and malignancy, which are
the leading causes of death in transplant patients. While new tolerance induction strategies are evolving, like
Treg therapies and mixed chimerism, they are limited in their ability to only be used for living donor transplants
and difficulties in ex vivo culture and expansion. However, developments in the field of ex vivo machine
perfusion of transplanted organs now offer unique therapeutic opportunities to treat donor organs prior to their
implantation into the recipient. My work focuses on creating a system that leverages advances in ex vivo
perfusion to install a bio-orthogonal surface targeting moiety on an organ, which is introduced to the organ via
ex vivo perfusion during its time in transport. I hypothesize that this targeting system will allow for the
systemic dosing of lipid nanoparticles that bind only to vascular endothelium expressing the bio-
orthogonal target within the organ, therefore allowing for localized immunosuppression and immune
tolerance induction, while minimizing the highly undesirable and toxic side effects of
immunosuppressive drugs. Aim 1 of this proposal demonstrates the targeted drug delivery to vascular
endothelium via lipid nanoparticle binding to permanently expressed bio-orthogonal moiety in two dimensional
endothelial culture. Aim 2 includes the optimization and demonstration of the LNP targeting system to
effectively deliver therapeutic cargo under physiological sheer stress and flow conditions. This will be
performed in ex vivo perfused human blood vessels. Aim 3 harnesses the ability of the system to be utilized in
a relevant heterotopic murine heart transplantation model as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the ability for
the targeted particles to localized to a transplanted organ.
 This proposal builds around four key components of critical research and clinical skills to support my
development into an independent physician scientist: (1) an interdisciplinary research project focusing on a
novel nucleic acid delivery system for the selective delivery of therapeutics to a transplanted organ (2) multi-
disciplinary mentoring from Drs. Grinstaff (biomaterials, nanoparticles, drug delivery) and Osho (clinical
medicine, animal models, and ex vivo perfusion), (3) academic physician scientist training in research
conduct and communication skills, (4) clinical awareness program, overseen by Dr. Osho a na�onally recognized
leader in the ﬁeld.

Microbiota and Extracellular Matrix Interactions that Drive Host Tissue Remodeling,Microbiota and Extracellular Matrix Interactions that Drive Host Tissue Remodeling,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Knowledge about the human microbiome has increased exponentially in the last twenty years, leading to its
association with a wide variety of conditions and diseases. However, many of the mechanisms underlying the
relationships between microbes and their human hosts have not been elucidated, particularly at the tissue level.
The human extracellular matrix (ECM) provides important structural and biochemical cues for the development
and homeostasis of all human tissues. Extensive ECM remodeling is a prominent feature of several diseases
linked to human microbiome dysfunction including pulmonary cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and
cervical cancer. Yet, regardless of tissue or body part, host cells (e.g. fibroblasts, macrophages, and neutrophils)
are considered the primary drivers of ECM degradation, even though human-associated microorganisms are
known to secrete active proteases. Thus, crucial ECM-microbiome interactions should be included in existing
paradigms of host ECM remodeling. To address this important knowledge gap, our lab develops in vitro and ex
vivo models using biomaterials and tissue engineering strategies to explore the fundamental mechanisms behind
ECM-microbe interactions. We hypothesize that commensal microbiota can degrade human ECM and that
ECM remodeling, in turn, alters host cell behavior. The proposed research program will initially answer three
key questions: 1) What environmental conditions enable bacterial degradation of host ECM? Our
preliminary data demonstrates that commensal bacteria grown in complete growth medium can degrade
individual ECM components in vitro. Because environmental factors influence bacterial metabolism, we will
explore how factors such as pH, and nutrient source impact ECM degradation by gut and vaginal bacterial
species. 2) How do human-associated bacteria remodel host ECM? In parallel to question 1, we will use
metaproteomics and inhibition studies to identify the specific proteases and carbohydrate degrading enzymes
involved in ECM degradation. Additionally, we will develop an ex vivo tissue culture model to characterize the
extent of bacterial ECM remodeling. 3) What are the consequences of microbiota-driven ECM remodeling
for host immune cells? Because the ECM regulates cell behavior, we will test the hypothesis that ECM modified
by the microbiome impacts host cell function. We will generate in vitro biomaterial platforms that capture the
properties of native ECM and incubate them with microbiota culture supernatant. We will then expose innate
immune cells to the remodeled matrices and evaluate their phenotype. This ESI-MIRA award will enable my
group to discover interactions between bacterial microbiota and host ECM, shedding light on the microbiome’s
underexplored contributions to tissue maintenance and dysfunction. Ultimately, the vision for my research
program is to determine the impact of the human microbiome on ECM remodeling and leverage this new
knowledge to develop novel diagnostics and therapeutic strategies.",<Address><Autoregulation><Award><Bacteria><Biochemical><Biocompatible Materials><Biomaterials><Blood Neutrophil><Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil><Body Tissues><Body part><CF lung disease><Carbohydrates><Cell Body><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Cervical Cancer><Cervix Cancer><Cues><Data><Development><Disease><Disorder><Dysfunction><ECM><Environmental Factor><Environmental Risk Factor><Enzyme Gene><Enzymes><Esteroproteases><Extracellular Matrix><Extracellular Matrix Degradation><Fibroblasts><Functional disorder><Generalized Growth><Growth><Health><Homeostasis><Human><Human Microbiome><Immune><Immunes><In Vitro><Incubated><Individual><Inflammation><Inflammatory Bowel Diseases><Inflammatory Bowel Disorder><Knowledge><Light><Link><Macrophage><Maintenance><Malignant Cervical Neoplasm><Malignant Cervical Tumor><Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix><Malignant Tumor of the Cervix><Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri><Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm><Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor><Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri><Marrow Neutrophil><Microbe><Modeling><Modern Man><Mφ><Neutrophilic Granulocyte><Neutrophilic Leukocyte><Nutrient><Peptidases><Peptide Hydrolases><Phenotype><Photoradiation><Physiological Homeostasis><Physiopathology><Polymorphonuclear Cell><Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes><Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils><Process><Property><Protease Gene><Proteases><Proteinases><Proteolytic Enzymes><Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis><Research><Role><Sight><Source><Subcellular Process><Testing><Tissue Engineering><Tissue Growth><Tissues><Uterine Cervix Cancer><Vagina><Vision><Work><bacteria metabolism><bacterial metabolism><bioengineered tissue><biological material><cell behavior><cellular behavior><commensal bacteria><commensal bacterial species><commensal flora><commensal microbes><commensal microbiota><commensal microflora><cystic fibrosis lung><cystic fibrosis lung disease><developmental><engineered tissue><environmental risk><human flora><human microbial communities><human microbiota><human microflora><human tissue><human-associated microbial communities><human-associated microbiome><human-associated microbiota><inflammatory disease of the intestine><inflammatory disorder of the intestine><intestinal autoinflammation><metaproteomics><microbial><microbial consortia><microbial flora><microbiome><microbiota><microflora><microorganism><multispecies consortia><neutrophil><new diagnostics><new therapeutic approach><new therapeutic intervention><new therapeutic strategies><new therapy approaches><new treatment approach><new treatment strategy><next generation diagnostics><novel diagnostics><novel therapeutic approach><novel therapeutic intervention><novel therapeutic strategies><novel therapy approach><ontogeny><pathophysiology><programs><social role><tissue culture><visual function>,Clinical Research; Microbiome
Computation-aided Molecular Design of DNA-Inspired Janus Base Biomaterials for Intracellular Delivery,Computation-aided Molecular Design of DNA-Inspired Janus Base Biomaterials for Intracellular Delivery,"Abstract
 The overall goal of this proposal is to develop novel biomaterials for intracellular therapeutics delivery.
While messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are recognized as promising candidates for RNA therapeutics (such as anti-
inflammatory drugs) as well as research tools (such as delivering Cas9 mRNA for gene editing), unlike many
chemical molecules or antibody proteins, mRNAs need to be delivered into cell cytoplasm to be functional.
Various types of materials have been developed for successful intracellular delivery of small RNAs, but it is still
a major challenge to achieve effective delivery of mRNAs at both cellular and systemic levels. We aim to
overcome this by optimizing the biointerface properties of DNA-inspired Janus base biomaterials using
computational methods for molecular design, with experimental validation.
 There are two important obstacles for effective mRNA delivery: at the cellular level, the delivered RNA
cargos can be trapped and degraded inside cell endosomes after endocytosis (internalization by cells). For
example, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are commonly used delivery vehicles for mRNA in both academic and
industrial settings. However, the effectiveness of conventional LNPs is limited by their poor endosomal escape
ability which leads to the destruction of a significant portion of RNA cargos. At the systemic level (when
administrated intravenously), RNA delivery materials usually require surface modifications to reduce specific
and non-specific binding of serum proteins (or formation of protein coronas), increase blood circulation time,
and improve biodistribution. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a widely used surface modification polymer in clinics,
but its efficacy is significantly restricted because it can cause undesired immunogenicity in patients.
 To overcome these limitations, we will develop a novel delivery technology by manipulating the biointerface
properties of the DNA-inspired Janus base nanopieces (JBNps). JBNps are slimmer than conventional
spherical particles, allowing for enhanced infiltration into tissue matrices and barriers. As a result, JBNps have
a distinct advantage for delivery into “hard-to-penetrate” tissues such as articular cartilage and kidneys. Our
central hypothesis of this study is that sidechain and zwitterionic modifications can manipulate biointerface
properties of JBNps, accomplishing highly effective mRNA delivery into target tissues. Once our hypothesis is
confirmed, we can use JBNps to deliver mRNA for articular cartilage and kidney applications such as anti-
inflammatory mRNA therapeutics.",<Anti-Inflammatories><Anti-Inflammatory Agents><Anti-inflammatory><Antibodies><Base Pairing><Behavior><Binding><Biocompatible Materials><Biodistribution><Biomaterials><Blood Circulation Time><Body Tissues><Cartilage Diseases><Cell Body><Cells><Chemicals><Clinic><Computing Methodologies><Cytoplasm><DNA><Deoxyribonucleic Acid><Drugs><Effectiveness><Endocytosis><Endosomes><Family><Future><Genes><Goals><Health><In Vitro><Industrialization><Infiltration><Intravenous><Kidney><Kidney Diseases><Kidney Urinary System><Knowledge><Life><Liver><Macrogols><Medication><Messenger RNA><Methodology><Methods><Mission><Modification><Molecular><Molecular Interaction><NIH><Names><Nanotubes><National Institutes of Health><Nature><Nephropathy><Neurofibrillary Tangles><Non-Polyadenylated RNA><Organism><Patients><Penetration><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Polyethylene Glycols><Polyethylene Oxide><Polyethyleneoxide><Polymers><Polyoxyethylenes><Process><Property><Proteins><Public Health><Publishing><RNA><RNA Gene Products><RNA based therapeutics><RNA based therapy><RNA delivery><RNA therapy><Receptosomes><Renal Disease><Research><Ribonucleic Acid><Rod><Serum Proteins><Shapes><Side><Small RNA><Surface><Technology><Testing><Therapeutic><Tissues><United States National Institutes of Health><Validation><Work><articular cartilage><base><bases><biological material><cartilage disorder><computational methodology><computational methods><computer based method><computer methods><computing method><deliver mRNA><deliver messenger RNA><delivery system for mRNA><delivery vector><delivery vehicle><design><designing><disability><drug/agent><endosome membrane><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><hepatic body system><hepatic organ system><immunogenicity><improved><in silico><in vivo><kidney disorder><lipid based nanoparticle><lipid nanoparticle><living system><mRNA><mRNA delivery><messenger RNA delivery><name><named><naming><nano particle><nano-sized particle><nanoparticle><nanosized particle><neurofibrillary degeneration><neurofibrillary lesion><neurofibrillary pathology><novel><particle><polymer><polymeric><renal><renal disorder><response><self assembly><small molecule><tangle><technological research and development><technology research and development><therapeutic RNA><tool><validations>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Nanotechnology
Enhanced Delivery of Cytotoxic Neural Stem Cells for Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme Using an Innovative In-situ Thermogelling Hydrogel and Focused Ultrasound,Enhanced Delivery of Cytotoxic Neural Stem Cells for Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme Using an Innovative In-situ Thermogelling Hydrogel and Focused Ultrasound,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of brain cancer and ~90% of GBM patients die
within 24 months after diagnosis.1 Treatment options for GBM include surgery and chemoradiation however,
recurrence is common, and the disease is universally fatal.2,3 Over the past 20 years, induced neural stem cells
(iNSCs) have been investigated as a novel modality for the treatment of brain cancer. The ability of iNSCs to
home to tumors and kill cancer cells are makes them attractive as a new approach for the treatment of GBM.
Other potential challenges include the need for repeated invasive surgery for redosing or to remove the
biomaterial if it is not biodegradable in nature. To address these limitations, we propose to develop a combination
therapy that harnesses long-acting delivery (>90 days) of NSCs using a novel injectable and biodegradable
biomaterial and a non-invasive and efficient redosing of NSCs across the blood brain barrier (BBB) using state-
of-the-art focused ultrasound (FUS) technology for enhanced treatment of GBM. The Scientific Premise of these
studies is that A) an injectable biodegradable hydrogel scaffold can be developed that: 1) implements a
tunable/scalable manufacturing process, 2) can accommodate high concentrations of NSCs (≥106 cells/mL) with
initial targeted sustained delivery of ≥3 months, and 3) is biodegradable and does not require surgical removal
post administration; B) a non-invasive systemic redosing regimen of NSCs to recurring GBM using FUS to
delivery NSCs across the BBB. Our central hypothesis is that sustained local delivery of NSCs ( 3 months)
alone or in combination with non-invasive redosing using FUS will improve access to residual or recurring tumor
cells and survival outcomes in preclinical models. This cutting-edge combined approach will be utilized to
evaluate the scientific premise of our proposal in preclinical mouse models to investigate the safety and efficacy
of a unique and highly innovative combinatorial technology and treatment approach to improve treatment of
GBM.",<APO2L><Abscission><Address><Apo-2L><BBB permeabilization><BBB permeable><Biocompatible Materials><Biodistribution><Biomaterials><Blood - brain barrier anatomy><Blood-Brain Barrier><Brain><Brain Cancer><Brain Nervous System><Cell Body><Cells><Characteristics><Chitosan><Clinical><Combined Modality Therapy><Detectable Residual Disease><Development><Diagnosis><Dimensions><Disease><Disorder><Distant><Dose><Drug Delivery><Drug Delivery Systems><Encephalon><Engineering><Enhancement Technology><Evaluation><Excision><Extirpation><Extravasation><Focused Ultrasound><Focused Ultrasound Ablation><Focused Ultrasound Therapy><Focused Ultrasound Treatment><Formulation><Fostering><Glioblastoma><Goals><Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm><Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor><Grade IV Astrocytoma><Health Benefit><Hemato-Encephalic Barrier><High Power Focused Ultrasound><High-intensity focused ultrasound><Home><Homing><Hydrogels><Improve Access><In Situ><Injectable><Injections><Intrasurgical Resection Cavity><Investigators><K Cells><Killer Cells><Leakage><Malignant Cell><Malignant Tumor of the Brain><Malignant neoplasm of brain><Marketing><Mediating><Methods><Microbubbles><Minimal Residual Disease><Modality><Multimodal Therapy><Multimodal Treatment><Nature><Neural Stem Cell><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Otomy><Patients><Poliglusam><Pre-Clinical Model><Preclinical Models><Process><Property><Proteins><Public Health><Recurrence><Recurrent><Recurrent Neoplasm><Recurrent tumor><Regimen><Removal><Research Personnel><Researchers><Resection Cavity><Residual><Residual Neoplasm><Residual Tumors><Residual state><Resolution><Route><Safety><Spillage><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><Surgical Removal><Surgical incisions><Surgically-Created Cystic Resection Cavity><Surgically-Created Resection Cavity><TL2><TNFSF10><TNFSF10 gene><TRAIL><Technology><Testing><Therapeutic><Time><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Treatment Protocols><Treatment Regimen><Treatment Schedule><Treatment outcome><Tumor Cell><Variant><Variation><allergen response><allergic response><allergy response><anti-cancer><biological material><biomaterial scaffold><bioscaffold><blood-brain barrier permeabilization><blood-brain barrier permeable><bloodbrain barrier><bloodbrain barrier permeabilization><bloodbrain barrier permeable><cancer cell><cell engineering><cellular engineering><chemo-/radio-therapy><chemo-radio-therapy><chemo-radiotherapy><chemoradiation><chemoradiation therapy><chemoradiation treatment><chemoradiotherapy><clinical development><combination therapy><combinatorial><combined modality treatment><combined treatment><cytotoxic><delivery vector><delivery vehicle><density><design><designing><determine efficacy><developmental><efficacy analysis><efficacy assessment><efficacy determination><efficacy evaluation><efficacy examination><efficacy outcomes><evaluate efficacy><examine efficacy><glioblastoma multiforme><homes><hydrogel scaffold><improved><in vivo><incision><innovate><innovation><innovative><manufacturing process><migration><minimally invasive><mouse model><multi-modal therapy><multi-modal treatment><murine model><neoplasm recurrence><neoplastic cell><nerve stem cell><neural precursor><neural precursor cell><neural progenitor><neural progenitor cells><neuro-oncology><neuron progenitors><neuronal progenitor><neuronal progenitor cells><neuronal stem cells><neurooncology><neuroprogenitor><new therapeutic approach><new therapeutic intervention><new therapeutic strategies><new therapy approaches><new treatment approach><new treatment strategy><novel><novel therapeutic approach><novel therapeutic intervention><novel therapeutic strategies><novel therapy approach><pre-clinical><preclinical><progenitor cell based therapy><progenitor cell therapy><progenitor cell treatment><progenitor therapy><progenitor treatment><radio-chemo-therapy><radio-chemotherapy><radiochemotherapy><rational design><resection><residual disease><resolutions><response><scaffold><scaffolding><self-renew><self-renewal><spatiotemporal><spongioblastoma multiforme><stem and progenitor cell therapy><stem cell based therapy><stem cell mediated therapy><stem cell therapeutics><stem cell therapy><stem cell treatment><stem cell-based therapeutic><stem cell-based treatment><surgery><survival outcome><therapy optimization><treatment optimization><tumor>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Brain Cancer; Brain Disorders; Cancer; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Radiation Oncology; Rare Diseases; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human

pathways and disease states. Interactions of the glycans with glycan binding proteins enable these important
and diverse biological functions. However, the multivalent nature of glycan-protein interactions, as well as the
dependence on distance and orientation, have prevented the Glycoscience community from realizing the full
therapeutic potential of glycans. The proposed, customizable glycan-modified material will enable the
identification and characterization of glycans relevant to human health and explore their effects in a controlled
and customizable extracellular environment.
The first component of the customizable 3D matrix is a suite of thiol-functionalized glycans. Homogeneous glycan
substrates can be tagged with a thiol functionality using reductive amination at the reducing-end of commercially
available glycans or those obtained after fractionation of natural samples. Heterogeneous glycan pools can be
similarly prepared after oxidative or enzymatic cleavage of saccharides from biological samples. The thiol-
functionalized glycans produced offer distinct advantages over existing probes in the efficiency and
spatiotemporal control of the conjugation techniques available. These thiol-modified glycans are first validated
using a microarray of the thiol-functionalized glycans attached to a glass surface. Glycan microarrays are a
sensitive and high-throughput tool to evaluate protein-glycan binding by screening glycan binding proteins,
antibodies, whole cells, or viruses. Previous microarray investigations have identified and quantified glycan-
protein interactions using direct or indirect detection of fluorescence. However, the proposed research plan
utilizes a customizable hydrogel matrix that enables the glycan-protein interaction to be meticulously
characterized: 1) three-dimensional environment effects 2) concentration dependent behavior; and 3) synergistic
or antagonistic interactions with other glycans.
The proposed diagnostic material system is a new tool to better understand the roles that glycans play in human
physiology and disease. The identification and characterization of glycan binding proteins will validate new drug
targets and diagnostic markers in disease states and have a profound effect on human health.",<3-D><3-D analysis><3-Dimensional><3-dimensional analysis><3D><3D analysis><Affect><Affinity><Amination><Antibodies><Assay><Behavior><Binding><Binding Proteins><Bioassay><Biocompatible Materials><Biological><Biological Assay><Biological Function><Biological Process><Biomaterials><Biotech><Biotechnology><Cell Body><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cells><Chemical Fractionation><Chemicals><Chemistry><Communities><Complex><Coupling><Dependence><Detection><Diagnostic><Diffusion><Digestion><Disease><Disorder><ECM><Environment><Equilibrium><Event><Extracellular Matrix><FRACN><Fluorescence><Fractionation><Fractionation Radiotherapy><Glass><Glycans><Glycolipids><Glycoproteins><Health><Human><Human Biology><Hydrogels><Imaging Procedures><Imaging Technics><Imaging Techniques><In Vitro><Investigation><Libraries><Ligand Binding Protein><Ligand Binding Protein Gene><Ligands><Maine><Measures><Mediating><Mercaptans><Mercapto Compounds><Methods><Modern Man><Molecular><Molecular Interaction><Nature><Pathway interactions><Physiology><Play><Polysaccharides><Protein Binding><Proteins><Proteoglycan><Research><Role><Sampling><Scientist><Sulfhydryl Compounds><Surface><System><Techniques><Technology><Therapeutic><Thiols><Three-dimensional analysis><Universities><Validation><Virulence><Virus><Work><balance><balance function><biologic><biological material><biomacromolecular><biomacromolecule><bound protein><chemical property><density><design><designing><diagnostic biomarker><diagnostic marker><diffused><diffuses><diffusing><diffusions><drug development><extracellular><fabrication><fluorescence imaging><fluorescent imaging><improved><in vivo><innovate><innovation><innovative><new drug target><new druggable target><new pharmacotherapy target><new therapeutic target><new therapy target><novel><novel drug target><novel druggable target><novel pharmacotherapy target><novel therapeutic target><novel therapy target><pathway><physical property><prevent><preventing><screening><screenings><social role><spatiotemporal><sulfhydryl group><three dimensional><tool><validations>,Bioengineering; Building Research Capacity at Institutions with Limited NIH Funding
Elucidating spatial and temporal dynamics of macrophage polarization using bioluminescence microscopy,Elucidating spatial and temporal dynamics of macrophage polarization using bioluminescence microscopy,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Macrophage polarization is involved in the progression of normal physiological and pathological
processes. The near universal importance of macrophage has led to widescale assessment of
the genomic and proteomic to classify their function. However, it is still a challenge to measure
macrophage polarization in real time such as in the context of assessing the status of a biomaterial
implant or the efficacy of a nanoparticle drug delivery system in a solid tumor. Our preliminary
data show that bioluminescence microscopy is able to deliver the protein expression data valuable
for macrophage polarization combined the cell tracking capability of traditional imaging system.
This research program will address the current gap in real-time assessment of macrophage
polarization by 1) further developing the technology to measure macrophage polarization
dynamics using bioluminescence microscopy and 2) assessing the intrinsic and extracellular
environmental stimuli that are most important for sensing macrophage polarization in a diseased
environment context. To accomplish these goals, we will employ ex-vivo culture systems and live
bioluminescence imaging. This work will identify novel strategies for measuring macrophage
polarization and validate the importance of analyzing polarization in a disease context. Ultimately,
this research will lead to new strategies for synthetic biology development, enhancement of
diagnostic testing and development of new therapeutic targets. In addition, the knowledge and
tools developed can be applied to other cells where polarization is paramount such as stem cell
differentiation, chemoattraction, and cell metabolism.",<Biocompatible Materials><Bioluminescence><Biomaterials><Biosensor><Cell Body><Cells><Cellular Metabolic Process><Classification><Data><Development><Diagnostic tests><Disease><Disorder><Drug Delivery><Drug Delivery Systems><Environment><Genomics><Goals><Implant><Knowledge><Macrophage><Measures><Metals><Microscopy><Monitor><Mφ><Organism-Level Process><Organismal Process><Pathologic Processes><Pathological Processes><Patient outcome><Patient-Centered Outcomes><Patient-Focused Outcomes><Patients><Physiologic Processes><Physiological Processes><Proteomics><Research><Solid Neoplasm><Solid Tumor><Stimulus><System><Systematics><Technology><Time><Work><barriers to implementation><biological material><biological sensor><bioluminescence imaging><bioluminescent imaging><cell metabolism><cellular metabaolism><develop therapy><developmental><diagnostic development><extracellular><imaging system><implementation barriers><implementation challenges><improved><intervention development><nano particle><nano-sized particle><nanoparticle><nanoparticle drug><nanosized particle><new approaches><new drug target><new druggable target><new pharmacotherapy target><new therapeutic target><new therapy target><novel approaches><novel drug target><novel druggable target><novel pharmacotherapy target><novel strategies><novel strategy><novel therapeutic target><novel therapy target><patient oriented outcomes><personalization of treatment><personalized medicine><personalized therapy><personalized treatment><polarized cell><progenitor cell differentiation><progenitor differentiation><programs><protein expression><stem and progenitor differentiation><stem cell differentiation><success><synthetic biology><therapy development><tool><treatment development>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Nanotechnology
Genomic Basis of Telomere Length Regulation and Consequences for Complex Traits,Genomic Basis of Telomere Length Regulation and Consequences for Complex Traits,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Telomere length is considered a good biomarker of organismal and cellular aging. Telomeres get progressively
shorter with each cell division and rates of cellular turnover vary from cell type to cell type and tissue to tissue.
When telomeres become critically short, cells arrest their proliferation and go into senescence resulting in
tissue dysfunction. Telomere length and the rate of telomere shortening shows a great deal of interindividual
variability and is dependent on many factors including genetics, age, environment, and lifestyle. Several age-
related diseases have been associated with telomere shortening including pulmonary fibrosis, COPD, liver
fibrosis, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, myocardial
hypertrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, ischemia-reperfusion injury, chronic kidney disease, kidney fibrosis,
osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis. The effect of genetics on telomere length has been estimated to be 35-85%
and at least 17 genes have been reported to regulate telomere length and cause telomere biology disorders
(TBD) when disrupted (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, TINF2, WRAP53, CTC1, RTEL1, PARN, ACD,
POT1, NAF1, STN1, ZCCHC8, RPA1, and DCLRE1B). These genes do not explain all cases of TBD and more
telomere length regulators have yet to be characterized. Our proposal is in response to NOT-AG-23-020, which
is meant “to encourage the use of existing cohorts and datasets for well-focused secondary analyses” to
address critical questions in aging research. We have designed our proposal to harness the unique large data
resources at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and
BioVU, and the large public data resources (GTEx consortium, All of Us, and the UK Biobank). We will
reanalyze these datasets, combining multi-omics modeling and phenome-scale interrogation, to identify new
genes and variants responsible for telomere shortening, telomere disease risk, premature aging, and their
phenome-wide consequences. By re-analyzing large data sets already at our disposal, we will be able to
identify novel genes and variants responsible for the telomere shortening and provide a more complete picture
of the role of aberrant telomere length and dysfunctional telomere maintenance in pathophysiological
processes. A better understanding of the genetic and biological drivers of telomere shortening may provide
insights into disease risk, earlier diagnosis, and new kinds of therapies. Our Aims are to: 1) Determine the
genetic basis of telomere shortening in diverse tissues, 2) Determine the phenome-wide consequences of
telomere length using large-scale biobanks, 3) Identify disease causing variants (DVs) in novel genes
associated with Telomere Biology Disorders (TBD)",<AD dementia><Academic Medical Centers><Acceleration><Address><African><Age><Aging><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer

Engineered bacterial in situ vaccines against oral cancer.,Engineered bacterial in situ vaccines against oral cancer.,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
Immunotherapy has become an emerging standard-of-care (SOC) for many different cancer types. However,
only 15-20% of patients receive durable benefit. Other limitations include the toxicity of systemically-delivered
immunomodulators which may require frequent, high doses and lead to immune-related adverse events (irAEs).
The risk of severe, and potentially fatal, irAEs increases as the field moves towards immune/immune and
immune/SOC combination therapies. As the “front line” of tumor/immune interaction, the tumor immune
microenvironment (TIME) is a critical locus of immunomodulation, where the kinds of immunocytes in the TIME
predict the likelihood of response to diverse immunotherapies. One strategy to favorably modulate the TIME
following standard-of-care surgical resection, is to localize and sustain immunotherapy at the resection site and
tumor-draining lymph nodes, reversing the immunosuppressive post-surgical wound healing immune
microenvironment while promoting anti-tumor effector cell immunity. This in situ therapeutic cancer vaccination
approach can enhance local concentration of potent therapies while minimizing systemic exposure and likelihood
and severity of irAEs. The use of synthetically engineered microbes as platforms for cancer immunotherapy
provides the potential to intelligently direct and modulate immune cells in situ. Our biomaterial-encapsulated
engineered bacteria are at the forefront of this field, with the ability to carry out targeted localization of engineered
non-pathogenic E. coli releasing TIME-modulating therapeutic molecules. This allows for reduced off-target
toxicity, dose-sparing, and targeting of multiple immune pathways to address the heterogeneous nature of
cancers. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that our living in situ vaccination platform EcN-IL12Vax can
achieve localized and controlled delivery of immunostimulatory cytokines, targeting the post-tumor resection
immune microenvironment and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) to produce robust anti-tumor responses
that eliminate both local tumor recurrence and lymph node metastases. Importantly, we hypothesize that our use
of bacteria will stimulate the innate immune system while their IL-12 secretion will stimulate the adaptive immune
system, thereby leading to enhanced residual tumor killing. We will characterize the immune response and
efficacy of EcN-IL12Vax in two Specific Aims: Aim 1 will develop potent and programmable non-pathogenic E.
coli as part of a biomaterial-encapsulated engineered bacterial in situ vaccination platform capable of secreting
the immunostimulatory cytokine IL-12. Aim 2 will examine how the duration of IL-12 secretion from EcN-IL12Vax
affects both the efficacy and durability of the immunologic response within the immunosuppressive tumor
resection cavity immune microenvironment and tumor-draining lymph nodes. This transformative approach will
provide the field with an invaluable in situ cancer vaccine platform that can be modified and leveraged for other
solid cancers in future studies and could enable further exploration of additional cytokines and therapeutics with
substantial toxicity at narrow concentration windows where they are both safe and effective.",<Abscission><Adaptive Immune System><Address><Adjuvant><Affect><Alginates><Animals><Antigen-Presenting

Modulating blood flow and metabolism in Alzheimer's Disease models,Modulating blood flow and metabolism in Alzheimer's Disease models,"ABSTRACT
This project will develop and apply new intravital microscopy techniques to gain greater insight into the putative
benefits effects of gamma entrainment, a promising nonpharmacological neuromodulation technique for
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other brain pathologies. Investigators recently demonstrated the powerful effects
of neuromodulation strategies for preserving synchronized neuronal activity in circuit pathways between the
visual cortex, hippocampus, and pre-frontal cortex. Gamma entrainment using sensory stimulus (GENUS) is a
simple, noninvasive gamma entrainment technique involving repeated exposure to a 40 Hz visual or auditory
stimulus. This method is easily translatable, and remarkably, experiments in preclinical animal models show that
it effectively reduces Amyloid levels and synaptic degradation while evoking morphological changes and cytokine
secretion from microglia. In some human patients, the technique has shown promise for reducing cognitive
decline. Ostensibly, the stimulus parameters require optimization to improve its efficacy in AD patients. The goal
of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how GENUS influences cerebral energy metabolism and
microvascular hemodynamics. Advanced microscopy methods will be developed and applied to mouse models
of AD to nondisruptively characterize GENUS-related changes to cellular signaling, metabolism, and
microvascular blood flow in the living brain with cellular resolution. By developing new microscopy techniques,
we will explore how these indicators of metabolism and cerebral blood flow change in different regions of the
brain in response to GENUS neuromodulation. The project’s findings will improve our understanding of the
technique’s operating mechanisms. By understanding how GENUS affects measurable changes of brain
hemodynamics, the results will eventually guide strategies to optimize its utility in human patients. Ultimately,
the project’s findings will facilitate development of accessible, nonpharmacological methods to stem AD’s
dramatically increasing global prevalence.",<2-photon microscopy><AD dementia><AD model><AD pathology><Affect><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer risk factor><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimer's disease model><Alzheimer's disease pathology><Alzheimer's disease patient><Alzheimer's disease risk><Alzheimer's pathology><Alzheimer's patient><Alzheimers Dementia><Ammon Horn><Amyloid><Amyloid Substance><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Animals><Astrocytes><Astrocytus><Astroglia><Biocompatible Materials><Biomaterials><Blood Vessels><Blood flow><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Brain Pathology><Brain hemodynamics><Brain region><Cannulas><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cephalic><Cerebral cortex><Cerebrovascular Circulation><Cerebrum><Cognition><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Cornu Ammonis><Couples><Cranial><Development><Disturbance in cognition><Drug Therapy><Effectiveness><Encephalon><Energy Expenditure><Energy Metabolism><Engineering><Exposure to><Feedback><Foundations><Frequencies><Goals><Hippocampus><Hortega cell><Human><Image><Imaging Procedures><Imaging Technics><Imaging Techniques><Impaired cognition><Incidence><Intermediary Metabolism><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigation><Investigators><Knowledge><Label><Measurable><Measurement><Measures><Metabolic><Metabolic Processes><Metabolism><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Microglia><Microinjections><Microscopy><Modern Man><Morphology><Murine><Mus><Needles><Nerve Cells><Nerve Degeneration><Nerve Impulse Transmission><Nerve Transmission><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neuroimmune><Neuron Degeneration><Neuronal Transmission><Neurons><O element><O2 element><Optics><Oxygen><Pathogenesis><Pathologic><Pathway interactions><Patients><Periodicals><Permeability><Pharmaceutical Agent><Pharmaceuticals><Pharmacologic Substance><Pharmacological Substance><Pharmacotherapy><Photic Stimulation><Pilot Projects><Pre-Clinical Model><Preclinical Models><Prefrontal Cortex><Prevalence><Preventive><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Reporting><Research Personnel><Researchers><Resolution><Risk Factors><Sensory><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Solid><Stimulus><Structure><Synapses><Synaptic><Techniques><Variant><Variation><Visual Cortex><Visual Stimulation><alzheimer model><alzheimer risk><astrocytic glia><auditory stimulus><awake><axon signaling><axon-glial signaling><axonal signaling><biological material><biological signal transduction><blood flow in brain><brain blood circulation><brain blood dynamics><brain blood flow><brain metabolism><brain oxygenation><cell imaging><cellular imaging><cerebral><cerebral blood flow><cerebral circulation><cerebral hemodynamics><cerebral oxygenation><cerebrocirculation><cerebrovascular blood flow><clinical efficacy><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive loss><combat><cost><cytokine><design><designing><developmental><drug treatment><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><gitter cell><glia signaling><glial activation><glial cell activation><glial signaling><hemodynamics><hippocampal><imaging><improved><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><intra-vital microscopy><intravital microscopy><lens><lenses><mesoglia><microglial cell><microgliocyte><microscope imaging><microscopic imaging><microscopy imaging><model of animal><mouse model><murine model><nerve signaling><neural control><neural degeneration><neural regulation><neural signaling><neuro-vascular><neuro-vascular coupling><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neurological degeneration><neuromodulation><neuromodulatory><neuronal><neuronal circuit><neuronal circuitry><neuronal degeneration><neuronal signaling><neuroregulation><neurotransmission><neurovascular><neurovascular coupling><novel><optical><pathway><patient living with Alzheimer's disease><patient suffering from Alzheimer's disease><patient with Alzheimer's><patient with Alzheimer's disease><perceptual stimulus><periodic><periodical><perivascular glial cell><pharmaceutical><physicochemical phenomena related to the senses><pilot study><pre-clinical><preclinical><preservation><primary degenerative dementia><resolutions><response><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><sensory stimulus><socio-economic><socio-economically><socioeconomically><socioeconomics><stem><success><synapse><tool><two photon excitation microscopy><two photon microscopy><vascular><visual cortical><visual stimulus>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Bioengineering; Brain Disorders; Cerebrovascular; Dementia; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences
Imaging Molecular Level Details of Collagen Fibers by VSFG Microscopy,Imaging Molecular Level Details of Collagen Fibers by VSFG Microscopy,"In this proposed project, we plan to fill the knowledge gap of the relationships between
microscopic self-assembled structures, collagen-molecule interactions and macroscopic fiber
morphologies of type-I collagen, the primary component of most human tissues and a commonly
used biomaterial for tissue engineering. By investigating collagen-water and collagen-protein
interactions in in vitro systems that mimic basic aspects of physiologically relevant three-
dimensional fibrillar tissue architectures, we aim to fill knowledge gaps in fundamental collagen
research. We will achieve this goal by developing a hyperspectral imaging technique – vibrational
sum frequency generation (VSFG) microscopy – at high repetition rates (400 kHz) and apply it to
collagen. The long-term vision is to develop new biophysics methods to reveal molecular-level
structures and interactions for pericellular space research and other complex biological
environments, and eventually applying it to study various pericellular environment related
diseases. In order to correlate spectral features to microscopic and macroscopic structures of
type I collagen, we plan to apply machine-learning techniques to analyze our data and extract
spectral signatures of collagen’s micro/macrostructures. We will two major scientific focuses: (A)
understanding molecular signatures of microscopic self-assembly fibrils structures and its
relationship to the macroscopic morphology (plan 1 and 2); and (B) investigating molecular level
collagen-molecule interactions (plan 3 and 4). Specific plans include:
 1. Obtaining hyperspectral VSFG images of collagen tissues to study their morphology in a
 label free and non-invasive manner
 2. Establishing molecular spectral signatures of self-assembled collagen fibril structures
 3. Understanding collagen-water interaction in first solvation layer of collagen fibers.
 4. Imaging spatial locations of chemicals and peptides that interact with collagens.
If successful, the significance is that a label free, vibrational mode specific imaging technique
specific for pericellular space will be available, which can reveal molecular level insights of
collagen structures and its interactions with surrounding molecules, pertinent to fibrosis and cell—
pericellular space interaction related diseases. This proposed project contributes to the scope of
NIGMS by developing new technology to reveal fundamental molecular-level principle,
mechanism and signatures related to morphology of collagen I at both micro- and macroscopic
scales, and collagen-molecule interactions, laying foundations for biophysical/biochemical
principles for future biomedical applications related to collagens.",<3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><Architecture><Binding><Biochemical><Biocompatible Materials><Biological><Biomaterials><Biophysics><Body Tissues><Cell Body><Cells><Chemical Structure><Chemicals><Collagen><Collagen Fiber><Collagen Fibril><Collagen Type I><Complex><Data><Data Bases><Databases><Development><Disease><Disorder><Engineering / Architecture><Environment><Fiber><Fibrosis><Foundations><Frequencies><Future><Generations><Goals><Hydrogen Oxide><Image><Imaging Procedures><Imaging Technics><Imaging Techniques><In Vitro><Knowledge><Label><Learning><Location><Machine Learning><Maps><Microscopic><Microscopy><Molecular><Molecular Fingerprinting><Molecular Interaction><Molecular Profiling><Monitor><Morphology><NIGMS><National Institute of General Medical Sciences><Peptides><Physiologic><Physiological><Proteins><Research><Structure><Sum><System><Techniques><Tissue Engineering><Tissues><Type 1 Collagen><Water><bioengineered tissue><biologic><biological material><biophysical approaches><biophysical foundation><biophysical methodology><biophysical methods><biophysical principles><biophysical sciences><biophysical techniques><data base><developmental><engineered tissue><human tissue><image construction><image generation><image reconstruction><imaging><insight><machine based learning><molecular imaging><molecular profile><molecular signature><molecule imaging><new technology><novel technologies><rational design><self assembly><simulation><three dimensional>,Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging

Vitreous metabolic perturbations during bacterial and fungal endophthalmitis,Vitreous metabolic perturbations during bacterial and fungal endophthalmitis,"Project Summary
Endophthalmitis is a devastating complication caused by a wide range of microorganisms which can result in
irreversible vision loss if not diagnosed and treated promptly. The current diagnostic approach heavily relies on
microbial culture to determine the etiology of endophthalmitis. However, only ~40% of suspected endophthalmitis
cases are culture-positive, leaving many potentially infectious culture-negative cases. Therefore, the discovery
of potential biomarkers is urgently needed for both the diagnosis of endophthalmitis and in guiding appropriate
antimicrobial therapy. Here, we propose to use metabolomics, an emerging high-throughput technology that can
identify, quantify, and characterize hundreds to thousands of low molecular weight biochemicals (metabolites),
using targeted or untargeted analytical approaches. Since metabolism is directly or indirectly linked to every
aspect of cell function, metabolomics is believed to reflect the phenotype of what is occurring in the body.
Recently, we performed untargeted metabolomics in an experimental model of endophthalmitis and discovered
distinct metabolic profiles of uninfected and bacterial-infected mouse eyes. Moreover, metabolomics analysis
led to discovering a therapeutic target, i.e., itaconate/Irg-1 signaling, to ameliorate experimental bacterial
endophthalmitis. Our pilot vitreous metabolomics analysis showed distinct metabolic profiles in patients with
uveitis, endophthalmitis, and other inflammatory retinal diseases. Based on preliminary data and our prior
publications, we hypothesize that “intraocular infections induce biochemical changes in the vitreous leading to
distinct metabolic signatures with translational potential for therapeutic targeting and/or diagnosis of infectious
endophthalmitis”. This will be tested by performing untargeted metabolomics in vitreous of culture-positive
bacterial and fungal endophthalmitis (Aim-1). We will further devise a metabolic profile to aid in predicting
endophthalmitis in culture-negative chohort. This will be accomplished this by developing an artificial intelligence
(AI) model that can predict endophthalmitis' etiology based on vitreous metabolic profiles (Aim-2). The
experiment will also involve validation using an independent cohort of culture-positive vitreous. The proposed
study will be the first to utilize metabolomics profiling to identify the metabolic sigantures in the vitreous of
endophthalmitis patients. The resulting profiles and/or biomarkers will be readily translatable for future clinical
studies, ultimately guiding precision medicine for diagnosing and treating ocular infections.",<AI based model><AI model><AI system><Abnormal Assessment of Metabolism><Acceleration><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Animals><Antibiotic Agents><Antibiotic Drugs><Antibiotics><Antifungal Therapy><Artificial Intelligence><Asian Indian><Bilateral><Bio-Informatics><Biochemical><Biocompatible Materials><Bioinformatics><Biological><Biological Markers><Biomaterials><Blindness><Body Tissues><Causality><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Citric Acid Cycle><Clinic><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Collaborations><Complement><Complement Proteins><Complication><Computer Reasoning><Country><Data><Diabetic Retinopathy><Diagnosis><Diagnostic><Disease><Disorder><Early Diagnosis><Endophthalmitis><Enzyme Gene><Enzymes><Epiretinal Membrane><Etiology><Experimental Models><Eye><Eye Enucleation><Eye Infections><Eye diseases><Eyeball><Future><Genes><Genus staphylococcus><Glaucoma><Global Change><Goals><Gram-Negative Bacteria><Gram-Positive Bacteria><Human><Incidence><India><Individual><Infection><Inflammation><Inflammatory><Innate Immunity><Intermediary Metabolism><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Knowledge><Krebs Cycle><Link><Liquid substance><Machine Intelligence><Machine Learning><Macular Hole><Metabolic><Metabolic Processes><Metabolic Studies><Metabolism><Metabolism Studies><Mice><Mice Mammals><Miscellaneous Antibiotic><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular Weight><Murine><Mus><Native Immunity><Natural Immunity><Non-Specific Immunity><Nonspecific Immunity><Ocular Infections><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Ophthalmia><Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures><Ophthalmological Surgery><Ophthalmological Surgical Procedures><Pathogenesis><Pathologic><Patients><Penetrating Eye Injuries><Phase><Phenotype><Physiologic><Physiological><Pilot Projects><Population><Prevention><Protein Analysis><Publications><Publishing><Recurrence><Recurrent><Research><Retinal Diseases><Retinal Disorder><Role><Sampling><Science><Scientific Publication><Sensitivity and Specificity><Sight><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Site><Staphylococcus><Subcellular Process><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><TCA cycle><Technology><Testing><Therapeutic><Tissues><Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle><Uveitis><Validation><Vision><anti-microbial><antimicrobial><artificial intelligence model><artificial intelligence-based model><bacterial endophthalmitis><bench bed side><bench bedside><bench to bed side><bench to bedside><bench to clinic><bench to clinical practice><bio-markers><biobank><biologic><biologic marker><biological material><biological signal transduction><biomarker><biorepository><causation><clinical diagnosis><cohort><complementation><computer based prediction><cytokine><diagnostic approach><diagnostic strategy><disease causation><early detection><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><eye disorder><eye surgery><fluid><fungal infectious disease treatment><fungus><glaucomatous><high throughput technology><human disease><human model><insight><liquid><machine based learning><metabolic abnormality assessment><metabolic profile><metabolism measurement><metabolomics><metabonomics><microbial><microorganism><model of animal><model of human><novel><ocular disease><ocular disorder><ophthalmopathy><pathogen><patient profile><pilot study><potential biological marker><potential biomarker><precision medicine><precision-based medicine><predictive modeling><prevent><preventing><profiles in patients><retina disease><retina disorder><retinopathy><small molecule><social role><surgery><therapeutic target><transcriptomics><translation to humans><translational opportunities><translational potential><validations><vision loss><visual function><visual loss>,Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Infectious Diseases; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Prevention
Co-Formulations of Amylin Analogues with Insulin Analogues for Treatment of Diabetes,Co-Formulations of Amylin Analogues with Insulin Analogues for Treatment of Diabetes,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The ultimate goal of the proposed work is to develop a novel co-formulation of insulin analogues (e.g. lispro
and aspart) with an amylin analogue (e.g. pramlintide) and with incretin hormones (e.g. liraglutide), to enable a
transformational new treatment for diabetes constituting a true replacement therapy. The most challenging
aspect of optimal glycemic control for the 1.45 million people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the United States is
limiting large increases in blood glucose after a meal. People with type 1 diabetes do not produce the insulin
required for the body to process glucose, so insulin must be replaced by daily injections. Amylin is a small
peptide hormone excreted alongside insulin by pancreatic β islet cells that acts centrally to slow gastric
emptying, suppress postprandial glucagon secretion, and decrease food intake, thus complementing the action
of insulin to regulate blood glucose levels. Similar to insulin, amylin production is completely absent in
individuals with type 1 diabetes on account of their lack of pancreatic β cells. T1D is also characterized by
abnormal suppression of glucagon secretion in response to hyperglycemia. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is
an incretin hormone and neurotransmitter secreted from intestinal L-cells in response to nutrients to stimulate
insulin and suppress glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists
(GLP-1 RAs) have become central to the treatment of diabetes and while these drugs are not yet approved for
T1D patients, GLP-1 RAs appear to be well tolerated in patients with T1D and could have beneficial effects in
both new onset and longstanding T1D patients. As an adjunctive therapy to insulin, GLP-1 RAs can improve
glycemic control and body weight in longstanding disease while also reducing insulin requirements in T1D
patients. Current administration regimens for these therapeutics are highly burdensome as they must be
injected either daily or weekly or taken daily orally. A true replacement therapy, therefore, would administer
both amylin and insulin simultaneously, while also delivering GLP-1 RAs. Unfortunately, Symlin (Pramlintide;
AstraZeneca), the only commercial amylin analogue formulation, is formulated at pH~4 while Novolog (Aspart;
Novonordisk) and Humalog (Lispro; Eli Lilly), insulin analogue formulations, are typically formulated at pH~7.4,
meaning that these formulations are incompatible and must be administered in separate injections. While
treatment of diabetes with separate injections of insulin and amylin analogues at mealtimes has been shown to
be much more effective than insulin alone at managing diabetes, the administration of two separate injections
is burdensome. We have developed a novel polymeric excipient that results in stable, ultra-fast acting insulin,
to formulate insulin and pramlintide together to enable a single administration treatment mimicking endogenous
hormone secretion. Additionally, we can effectively incorporate GLP-1 RAs into these formulations. This novel
combination therapy will yield unprecedented postprandial glycemic control and catalyze the development of a
powerful tool for the management of diabetes affording thus far unrealized therapeutic impact.","<Agonist><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Antidiabetic Hormone><Artificial Pancreas><Beta Cell><Biocompatible Materials><Biomaterials><Blindness><Blood Glucose><Blood Sugar><Body Weight><Brittle Diabetes Mellitus><Cardiac Diseases><Cardiac Disorders><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Clinical><Combined Modality Therapy><Coupled><D-Glucose><Development><Dextrose><Diabetes Mellitus><Diagnosis><Disease><Disorder><Drug Formulations><Drug Kinetics><Drugs><Eating><Endocrine Gland Secretion><Endocrine Therapy><Excipients><Excretory function><Family suidae><Food Intake><Formulation><GLP-1><GLP-1 receptor><GLP-I receptor><Gastric Emptying><Glucagon><Glucose><Glukagon><Goals><HG-Factor><Heart Diseases><Hormonal Therapy><Hormone secretion><Hormones><Humalog><Humulin R><Hyperglycemia><Hyperglycemic-Glycogenolytic Factor><IDDM><In Vitro><Individual><Injections><Insulin><Insulin Cell><Insulin Secreting Cell><Insulin, Lispro, Human><Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus><Insulinoma amyloid peptide><Intestinal Secretions><Islet Cell><Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus><Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus><L Cell (Intestine)><Lispro Insulin><Medication><Multimodal Therapy><Multimodal Treatment><Nerve Transmitter Substances><Neurotransmitters><NovoLog><Novolin R><Nutrient><Obesity><Oral><Outcome><PK/PD><Pancreas><Pancreatic><Pancreatic beta Cell><Pancreatic β-Cell><Patients><Peptide Hormone Gene><Persons><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Pharmacokinetics><Pigs><Polymers><Pramlintide><Process><Production><Pump><Rat model of diabetes><Regimen><Regular Insulin><Replacement Therapy><Research><Residual><Residual state><Structure of beta Cell of islet><Subcellular Process><Subcutaneous Injections><Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus><Suidae><Swine><T1 DM><T1 diabetes><T1D><T1DM><Technology><Testing><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Hormone><Time><Treatment Efficacy><Treatment Protocols><Treatment Regimen><Treatment Schedule><Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus><Type 1 diabetes><Type I Diabetes Mellitus><United States><Work><adiposity><amlintide><amylin><analog><biological material><blood glucose regulation><clinical relevance><clinically relevant><combination therapy><combined modality treatment><combined treatment><copolymer><corpulence><developmental><diabetes><diabetes associated peptide><diabetes management><diabetes mellitus management><diabetic><diabetic management><diabetic rat><diabetic rat model><drug candidate><drug/agent><excretion><glucagon-like peptide 1><glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor><glucose control><glucose homeostasis><glucose regulation><glycemic control><heart disorder><hormonal secretion><hormone therapy><hyperglycemic><improved><incretin hormone><innovate><innovation><innovative><insulin dependent diabetes><insulin dependent type 1><insulinoma amyloid polypeptide><intervention efficacy><islet amyloid polypeptide><juvenile diabetes><juvenile diabetes mellitus><ketosis prone diabetes><limb loss><liraglutide><lispro><lost limb><mimetics><model of animal><monomer><multi-modal therapy><multi-modal treatment><new approaches><novel><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><pancreas beta cell><pancreas β cell><pancreatic amylin><pancreatic b-cell><peptide hormone><pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics><polymer><polymeric><porcine><prevent><preventing><response><side effect><stomach emptying><subdermal injection><suid><synergism><therapeutic efficacy><therapy efficacy><tool><type I diabetes><type one diabetes><vision loss><visual loss><β-cell><β-cells><βCell>",Autoimmune Disease; Diabetes; Nutrition; Prevention
Building biophysical and biochemical complexity in 3D cell and tissue constructs,Building biophysical and biochemical complexity in 3D cell and tissue constructs,"Abstract
Within healthy adult tissues, a developing organism, and disease environments alike, cells exist in environments
where they receive and integrate external signals according to a phenotypic state, yielding responses in
cellular activities and behaviors or modifications to phenotypic state. Fundamental understanding of cellular
functioning and disease progression depends in part on our ability to systematically build and perturb model
cellular systems in vitro, and pressing biomedical challenges in translational medicine might be addressed
through the technology that enables breakthroughs in tissue engineering, including in meeting the critical
needs of patients awaiting organ transplants. Over the past decades, a range of biofabrication technologies
have been used to precisely arrange cells and materials within two- and three-dimensional structures. These
technologies have broadened our understanding biology and increased the complexity of tissue constructs that
might be used therapeutically. While biofabrication approaches developed over this time have greatly
benefitted our abilities to probe and understand biological questions—especially with respect to cells and their
environments—and to engineer cell-material constructs that recapitulate features of native tissues, significant
challenges persist in building multiscale biomimetic tissue constructs. Our lab’s research is focused on
addressing these challenges through the development and application of new biofabrication technologies that
are based on innovation in the design and use of hydrogel biomaterials. Within the next five years, the lab aims
to develop and apply unique hydrogel-based technology to bioprinting to address the critical need for
capabilities to create vascularized tissue constructs in which cell and material complexity can be specified in
extravascular regions and that can support dense cell populations. The lab will also develop new biofabrication
technologies that will allow unique capabilities for high resolution control over cellular and material structures
within macroscale constructs, with the goal of being able to simultaneously control a broad range of
microenvironmental features—including cell-cell interactions, biochemical cues, and biomechanical cues—that
a given cell experiences. We aim to develop technological capabilities and ultimately apply these capabilities to
building complex tissue constructs that might be used as platforms for studying tissue and vascular responses
to perturbations by physical and biological stimuli and to address key challenges in tissue engineering to
develop therapeutic tissue constructs. The work in this proposal thus aims to advance capabilities in the fields
of biofabrication and tissue engineering, with broad potential impacts in applied and translational research.",<2-dimensional><21+ years old><3-D><3-D structure><3-Dimensional><3-dimensional structure><3D><3D structure><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Applied Research><Applied Science><Behavior><Biochemical><Biocompatible Materials><Biological><Biological Mimetics><Biology><Biomaterials><Biomechanics><Biomimetics><Biophysics><Blood Vessels><Body Tissues><Cell Body><Cell Communication><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Density><Cell Function><Cell Interaction><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Signaling><Cell model><Cell-to-Cell Interaction><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Cellular model><Clinical><Complex><Cues><Development><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Engineering><Environment><Goals><Grafting Procedure><Hydrogels><In Vitro><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Medical><Metabolic><Methods><Modification><Organ Transplantation><Organ Transplants><Organism><Patients><Phenotype><Population><Position><Positioning Attribute><Process><Research><Resolution><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Specific qualifier value><Specified><Stimulus><Structure><Subcellular Process><Supporting Cell><System><Technology><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Uses><Time><Tissue Engineering><Tissue Model><Tissue constructs><Tissues><Translational Research><Translational Science><Vascularization><Work><adulthood><bio-fabrication><bio-printing><bioengineered tissue><biofabrication><biologic><biological material><biological signal transduction><biological systems><biomechanical><biophysical foundation><biophysical principles><biophysical sciences><bioprinting><design><designing><developmental><engineered tissue><experience><in vitro Model><in vivo><innovate><innovation><innovative><living system><meeting><meetings><model building><organ allograft><organ graft><organ xenograft><replacement tissue><resolutions><response><three dimensional><three dimensional structure><translation research><translational investigation><translational medicine><two-dimensional><vascular>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Regenerative Medicine
Pivotal Preclinical Studies of Novel Infusible ECM for Treating Acute MI,Pivotal Preclinical Studies of Novel Infusible ECM for Treating Acute MI,"Summary
Heart failure post-myocardial infarction (MI) continues to be the leading cause of death in the U.S. Each year it
is estimated that ~550K Americans will have a new MI, and ~200K will have a recurrent MI, leading to a large
body of patients suffering from heart failure. These staggering statistics necessitate the development of new
therapies for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine strategies
offer significant potential for the development of novel therapies to treat these patients. While cell therapies have
been extensively studied for the treatment of MI and heart failure, meta-analyses of initial cell therapy trials
suggest only a modest effect on cardiac function. More recently acellular biomaterials have shown great promise
in providing similar or greater functional benefit without the complications associated with cell delivery. Injectable
biomaterials that stimulate endogenous repair are an attractive alternative since potential therapies could still be
delivered minimally invasively via catheter yet could be off the shelf and have significantly reduced costs
compared to cell products. Ventrix is therefore focusing on cell-free regenerative medicine approaches. Ventrix
has a history of success in developing injectable biomaterials for treating ischemic cardiomyopathy. Two
previous NIH SBIRs resulted in an approved IND for VentriGel, an injectable, catheter-deliverable hydrogel
derived from decellularized porcine myocardium. This led to a recent successful Phase 1 clinical trial in patients
60 days to 3 years post-MI. We recently developed a new Infusible ECM, for treating acute MI. We showed it
can be delivered to an acute MI via intracoronary infusion and that it improves cardiac function in a rat acute MI
model following simulated intracoronary delivery. In our previous studies, we optimized delivery and retention of
Infusible ECM and demonstrated preliminary feasibility and efficacy in a porcine acute MI model. The studies
proposed in this Phase II project are part of the final steps to initiate studying Infusible ECM in patients, and a
key step in bringing a biomaterial product to market, which will be complementary to existing standard of care.
This will be the first intracoronary infusible regenerative biomaterial product for treating acute MI patients.","<Acetylcholine><Acute myocardial infarct><Acute myocardial infarction><American><Apoptosis><Apoptosis Pathway><Area><Arrhythmia><Balloon Angioplasty><Biocompatible Materials><Biological Agent><Biological Products><Biomaterials><Body Tissues><Businesses><Cardiac Arrhythmia><Cardiac Muscle Cells><Cardiac Myocytes><Cardiac infarction><Cardiocyte><Catheters><Cause of Death><Cell Body><Cell Therapy><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cells><Clinic><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Clinical Trials><Common Rat Strains><Contracting Opportunities><Contracts><Coronary Angiography><Development><Development Plans><ECM><Early-Stage Clinical Trials><Echocardiogram><Echocardiography><Eligibility><Eligibility Determination><Endothelium><Environment><Extracellular Matrix><Family suidae><Fibrosis><Gametes><Geometry><Germ Cells><Germ-Line Cells><Good Manufacturing Process><Good manufacturing practice><Heart><Heart Arrhythmias><Heart Muscle Cells><Heart failure><Heart myocyte><Histology><History><Holter Electrocardiography><Holter Monitoring><Holtmon><Hydrogels><Immunohistochemistry><Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue><Immunohistochemistry Staining Method><Infusion><Infusion procedures><Injectable><Injections><Intermediary Metabolism><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><LV remodeling><Left Ventricular Remodeling><MR Imaging><MR Tomography><MRI><MRIs><Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Marketing><Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance><Meta-Analysis><Metabolic Processes><Metabolism><Modeling><Myocardial><Myocardial Infarct><Myocardial Infarction><Myocardium><NIH><NMR Imaging><NMR Tomography><National Institutes of Health><Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Pathway interactions><Patients><Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty><Phase><Phase 1 Clinical Trials><Phase I Clinical Trials><Pigs><Pre-Clinical Model><Preclinical Models><Procedures><Programmed Cell Death><Protocol Screening><Rat><Rats Mammals><Rattus><Recording of previous events><Recurrence><Recurrent><Regenerative Medicine><Reproductive Cells><Risk><SBIR><Safety><Sex Cell><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Structure><Suidae><Swine><Therapy trial><Tissue Engineering><Tissues><Toxicology><Translating><Translations><Transluminal Angioplasty><Transluminal Arterial Dilatation><Transthoracic Echocardiography><United States National Institutes of Health><Work><Zeugmatography><bioengineered tissue><biological material><biologics><biopharmaceutical><biotherapeutic agent><cardiac failure><cardiac function><cardiac infarct><cardiac muscle><cardiomyocyte><cell mediated therapies><cell-based therapeutic><cell-based therapy><cellular therapeutic><cellular therapy><commercialization><compare cost><coronary attack><coronary infarct><coronary infarction><cost comparison><develop therapy><developmental><engineered tissue><function of the heart><heart attack><heart function><heart infarct><heart infarction><heart muscle><heart sonography><histories><improved><inflammatory environment><inflammatory milieu><infusions><initial cell><interest><intervention development><interventional strategy><ischemic cardiomyopathy><left ventricle remodeling><manufacture><minimally invasive><neovascularization><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new therapeutics><new therapy><next generation therapeutics><novel><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><pathway><patient population><phase 2 trial><phase I protocol><phase II trial><porcine><pre-clinical><pre-clinical study><preclinical><preclinical study><pressure><regenerative><repair><repaired><research study><safety assessment><sexual cell><standard of care><statistics><success><suid><therapy development><translation><treatment development>",Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Biotechnology; Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease; Regenerative Medicine
Regenerative biomaterial for combating genitourinary syndrome of menopause,Regenerative biomaterial for combating genitourinary syndrome of menopause,"Project Summary
Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is an extremely prevalent condition consequent to the
hypoestrogenic changes in the genitourinary tract that affects up to 85% of perimenopausal and menopausal
women. Major symptoms of GSM include vaginal dryness, itching, discomfort, burning, and pain; thus, GSM
significantly impacts quality of life during everyday activities and severely impairs sexual function. Despite its
high prevalence and interference with healthy aging, current treatments for GSM are suboptimal, with many
issues related to accessibility or long-term efficacy. Despite an astoundingly low satisfaction of only 35% with
treatments for GSM, whether prescribed or over-the-counter, women continue to suffer from lack of better
options. Thus, there remains a need for a safe and accessible therapy for this morbid condition that can both
alleviate symptoms and restore a healthy vaginal phenotype. The proposed study will determine if a low-cost,
acellular, tissue-specific, and minimally invasive regenerative therapy can repair the atrophic vaginal tissue,
resulting in an accessible, high-impact intervention for GSM. Given our previous successes with tissue-specific
pro-regenerative biomaterials, we opine that a novel vaginal tissue-derived ECM hydrogel (vECM) will reverse
vaginal atrophy by inducing epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation as well as neovascularization when
delivered as a topical treatment, and by improving tissue elasticity and smooth muscle phenotype when delivered
via injection. Using a validated preclinical model of GSM and an array of diverse multi-scale tools, we will
comprehensively characterize alterations in vaginal structural and functional properties due to menopause. We
will then create a novel biomaterial designed specifically to women’s health and assess its efficacy in treating
GSM – a chronic and understudied condition that negatively impact lives of millions of women world-wide.",<Affect><Age><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Animals><Anterior><Apoptosis><Apoptosis Pathway><Atrophic><Atrophy><Biochemical><Biocompatible Materials><Biomaterials><Biomechanics><Body Tissues><Cell Differentiation><Cell Differentiation process><Cell Growth in Number><Cell Multiplication><Cell Proliferation><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cellular Proliferation><Chromosome Mapping><Chronic><Clinical><Collagen><Data><Deterioration><Development><ECM><Elastic Tissue><Elasticity><Epithelial Cell Proliferation><Epithelium><Esthesia><Estrogens><Extracellular Matrix><Female Health><Gene Expression><Gene Localization><Gene Mapping><Gene Mapping Genetics><Generalized Growth><Genitourinary><Genitourinary system><Growth><Harvest><High Prevalence><Hydrogels><Immune response><Immunohistochemistry><Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue><Immunohistochemistry Staining Method><Immunological response><Immunomodulation><Impairment><In Situ><Inflammatory Infiltrate><Injectable><Injections><Intermediary Metabolism><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Involuntary Muscle><Itching><LLLT><Lamina Propria><Laser Biostimulation><Leanness><Linkage Mapping><Low-Level Laser Therapy><Low-Power Laser Irradiation><Low-Power Laser Therapy><Lubricants><Menopausal Syndrome><Menopause><Menopause Syndrome><Metabolic Processes><Metabolism><Muscle Atrophy><Muscular Atrophy><Oophorectomy><Ovariectomy><Pain><Painful><Pathologic><Pathway interactions><Perimenopausal><Perimenopause><Phenotype><Pre-Clinical Model><Pre-Menopause><Pre-menopausal Period><Preclinical Models><Premenopausal><Premenopausal Period><Premenopause><Programmed Cell Death><Proliferating><Property><Pruritic Disorder><Pruritis><Pruritus><Public Health><QOL><Quality of life><Research><SERMs><Safety><Saline><Saline Solution><Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators><Sensation><Sex Functioning><Skeletal Muscle><Smooth Muscle><Sprague-Dawley Rats><Symptoms><Testing><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Estrogen><Thick><Thickness><Thinness><Time><Tissue Growth><Tissues><Topical Drug Administration><Topical application><Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping><Treatment Efficacy><Up-Regulation><Upregulation><Urogenital><Urogenital System><Vagina><Vaginal Route of Drug Administration><Vascularization><Voluntary Muscle><Woman><Women's Health><administer topically><ages><alleviate symptom><ameliorating symptom><apply topically><biocompatibility><biological material><biomaterial compatibility><biomechanical><cellular differentiation><cohort><cost><decrease symptom><deliver topically><deprivation><design><designing><developmental><dry vagina><female gonadectomy><fewer symptoms><genetic mapping><genitourinary tract><healthy aging><healthy human aging><host response><immune modulation><immune regulation><immune system response><immunologic reactivity control><immunomodulatory><immunoregulation><immunoregulatory><immunoresponse><improved><in vivo><innovate><innovation><innovative><intervention efficacy><interventional strategy><intravaginal application><itch sensation><laser therapy><mechanical properties><menopause transition><minimally invasive><model of animal><multidisciplinary><muscle breakdown><muscle degradation><muscle deterioration><muscle loss><muscle wasting><neovascularization><novel><ontogeny><pathway><peri-menopausal><peri-menopause><pre-menopausal><premenopausal status><prevent><preventing><reduce symptoms><regenerate new tissue><regenerate tissue><regenerating damaged tissue><regenerating tissue><regeneration based therapy><regeneration therapy><regenerative><regenerative therapeutics><regenerative therapy><regenerative tissue><relieves symptoms><repair><repaired><satisfaction><sexual functioning><side effect><success><symptom alleviation><symptom reduction><symptom relief><therapeutic efficacy><therapy efficacy><tissue regeneration><tissue regrowth><tissue renewal><tissue specific regeneration><tool><topical administration><topical delivery><topical drug application><topical treatment><topically administered><topically applied><topically delivered><topically treated><transcriptomics><transition to menopause><transitional menopause><treat topically><urogenital tract><vagina dryness><vaginal application><vaginal dryness>,Aging; Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Estrogen; Menopause; Regenerative Medicine; Urologic Diseases; Women's Health Research
Bioengineering the bone microenvironment for improved craniofacial regeneration leveraging biomimetic mechanotransduction,Bioengineering the bone microenvironment for improved craniofacial regeneration leveraging biomimetic mechanotransduction,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of this proposal is to expand fundamental knowledge of bone repair mechanisms and
improve regenerative strategies for craniofacial bone repair by investigating microenvironmental factors
influencing osteogenic differentiation and bone regeneration. This work will employ a variety of biomimetic
hydrogels, designed to recapitulate the extracellular matrix during distinct stages of bone formation: (1) soft
collagen represents the initial matrix where undifferentiated stem cells reside, (2) high-density collagen reflects
mesenchymal condensation, (3) partially mineralized high-density collagen simulates onset of calcification, and
(4) a fully mineralized state indicative of mineralized woven bone. My preliminary data shows an early onset of
osteogenic differentiation in human mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (hMSC) cultured on biomineralized
hydrogels. However, the mechanisms to explain this accelerated regenerative response has not been thoroughly
investigated. I hypothesize that increased in matrix density and mineralization will enhance osteogenic
differentiation and bone regeneration. This hypothesis will be tested via Aim 1 by looking at adhesion-driven
mechanotransductive mechanisms in vitro and Aim 2 by evaluating the in vivo bone healing response.
Specific Aim 1 will examine the effect of the hydrogel model on osteogenic differentiation, focusing on the
molecular clutch of mechanotransduction – a process where mechanical stimuli from the microenvironment is
translated into biochemical activity, prompting cellular responses. This aim will evaluate the in vitro hMSC
behavior in response to these hydrogels, looking at focal adhesion, mechanotransductive, and differentiation
markers. Specific Aim 2 extends this analysis to an in vivo setting, testing the regenerative capacity of injectable
microgels in rat calvarial (skull) defects. By providing a comparative analysis of bone healing with the aid of
microgels of varying density and mineralization, this aim focuses on understanding the systemic host response
to bioengineered grafts to be able to identify microenvironmental conditions that enhance bone regeneration.
This application outlines a comprehensive training plan at a well-established institution, designed to develop my
expertise in bone tissue engineering and stem cell biology, essential for becoming a craniofacial surgeon-
scientist. My fellowship training will focus on gaining expertise in these areas, while developing professional skills
in communication, leadership, and teaching, which are essential for my career goals of improving clinical
outcomes through surgical innovation. Successful completion of this proposal will provide insights into designing
scaffolds that support microenvironments conducive to accelerate differentiation, leading to improved bone
regeneration outcomes. By elucidating how biomimetic environments influence differentiation and bone healing,
my work aims to contribute to the development of next-generation bioengineered bone grafts, facilitating effective
bone repair strategies and improving patient outcomes in craniofacial reconstruction.",<Acceleration><Address><Adhesion Plaques><Adhesions><Area><Assay><Autograft><Autologous><Autologous Transplantation><Autotransplant><Benchmarking><Best Practice Analysis><Binding Sites><Bioassay><Biochemical><Biocompatible Materials><Biological Assay><Biological Mimetics><Biomaterials><Biomedical Engineering><Biomimetics><Bone Development><Bone Formation><Bone Grafting><Bone Regeneration><Bone Tissue><Bone Transplantation><Bundle Bone><Calcified><Calvaria><Cell Body><Cell Communication><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Differentiation><Cell Differentiation process><Cell Function><Cell Interaction><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Signaling><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cell-Matrix Adherens Junctions><Cell-to-Cell Interaction><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Mechanotransduction><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Clinical><Collagen><Combining Site><Common Rat Strains><Communication><Complex><Data><Defect><Dependence><Development><Differentation Markers><Differentiation Antigens><Differentiation Markers><Differentiation in cell culture><ECM><Educational process of instructing><Engineering><Environment><Extracellular Matrix><Face><Failure><Fellowship><Focal Adhesions><Focal Contacts><Future><Gel><Genes><Genomics><Goals><Human><Hydrogels><Immature Bone><Immune response><Immunological response><In Vitro><In vitro cell differentiation><Incidence><Injectable><Institution><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Knowledge><Leadership><Link><Marker Antigens><Mechanical Signal Transduction><Mechanosensory Transduction><Mesenchymal><Mesenchymal Progenitor Cell><Mesenchymal Stem Cells><Mesenchymal progenitor><Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells><Methods><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><Molecular Dynamics Simulation><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Natural regeneration><Nonlamellar Bone><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Osteogenesis><Outcome><Pathway interactions><Patient outcome><Patient-Centered Outcomes><Patient-Focused Outcomes><Patients><Perception><Physical condensation><Physiologic Ossification><Physiological Ossification><Process><Progenitor Cells><Proteins><Public Health><Rat><Rats Mammals><Rattus><Reactive Site><Recovery><Regeneration><Regenerative capacity><Regenerative response><Role><Scientist><Series><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Site><Skull><Stromal Cells><Subcellular Process><Surgeon><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><Teaching><Testing><Tissue Donors><Tissue Engineering><Tissue constructs><Training><Translating><Undifferentiated><Vascularization><Work><Woven Bone><autologous graft><autotransplantation><benchmark><bio-engineered><bio-engineers><bioengineered tissue><bioengineering><biological engineering><biological material><biological signal transduction><biomineralization><bone><bone healing><bone loss><bone repair><bone tissue formation><bone transplant><bone wound healing><calcification><calvarial><career><cell behavior><cell regeneration><cell type><cellular behavior><cellular differentiation><cellular regeneration><comparative><condensation><craniofacial><craniofacial bone><craniofacial development><craniofacies><cranium><density><design><designing><developmental><differentiation in culture><differentiation in vitro><early onset><engineered tissue><faces><facial><healing><host response><hydrogel scaffold><immune system response><immunoresponse><improved><in vitro cellular differentiation><in vivo><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><intramembranous bone formation><intramembranous ossification><mechanical cue><mechanical properties><mechanical signal><mechanical stimulus><mechanosensing><mechanotransduction><mesenchymal stromal progenitor cells><mesenchymal-derived stem cells><mineralization><minimally invasive><molecular dynamics><nano meter scale><nano meter sized><nano-string><nanometer scale><nanometer sized><nanoscale><nanostring><next generation><normal ossification><osseous wound healing><ossification><osteogenic><pathway><patient oriented outcomes><progenitor biology><progenitor cell biology><progenitor cell differentiation><progenitor cell model><progenitor differentiation><progenitor model><reconstruction><recruit><regenerate><regenerate bone><regeneration ability><regeneration based therapy><regeneration capacity><regeneration potential><regeneration response><regeneration therapy><regenerative approach><regenerative potential><regenerative strategy><regenerative technique><regenerative therapeutics><regenerative therapy><regenerative tissue><repair strategy><response><scaffold><scaffolding><sensor><skills><social role><stem><stem and progenitor biology><stem and progenitor cell model><stem and progenitor differentiation><stem cell based model><stem cell biology><stem cell derived model><stem cell differentiation><stem cell model><stem cells><surgery><transcriptomics>,"Bioengineering;

Selectively eliminating residual human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in cell mixtures for cell therapy,Selectively eliminating residual human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in cell mixtures for cell therapy,"Abstract
 Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold tremendous promise for cell therapy. However, the
significant tumorigenic risk associated with residual iPSCs in cell mixture during cell transplantation remains a
major obstacle to their clinical applications. To address this challenge, we have assembled a multidisciplinary
team consisting of a biomaterials chemist (Xu) and a stem cell biologist (Lu). Our goal is to develop and evaluate
transient intranuclear peptide assemblies (nPAs) to selectively eliminate residual iPSCs without impacting iPSC-
derived cells in cell mixture—an unmet need in the field. We recently achieved selectively eliminating iPSCs
without harming iPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) using transient nPA. This selectivity hinges
on the well-documented overexpression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in iPSCs. ALP catalytically
dephosphorylates a phospho-L-peptide precursor, forming transient nPAs capable of eliminating iPSCs. This
nPA precursor exhibits exceptional selectivity, rapidly eradicating iPSCs in cell mixture within 2 hours due to
three key factors: (i) iPSCs express high levels of ALP, (ii) ALP expression decreases significantly in iPSC-
derived and normal cells, and (iii) nPAs comprise L-peptides that undergo proteolysis within the cellular
environment. However, it remains to be verified whether nPA precursors/building blocks would affect iPSC-
derived cells beyond HPCs and whether the elimination of residual iPSCs in the cell mixture is sufficient to
prevent tumor formation from the cell transplantation in vivo. Additionally, the design principles governing nPA
precursors have yet to be established. Therefore, we propose to explore nPAs for eliminating residual iPSCs
from cell mixtures containing iPSCs and iPSC-derived photoreceptor precursor cells (PPCs) by the studies
focusing on three specific aims: Aim 1: Design, synthesize, and characterize nPA precursors to conduct a
preliminary structural-to-activity relationship (SAR) study. Aim 2: Evaluate nPAs on iPSCs and iPSC-derived
photoreceptor precursor cells (PPCs) using cell assays. Aim 3: Examining the efficacy of nPAs to prevent tumor
formation from cell transplantation using a standard murine model. The successful completion of these studies
will provide a novel approach to eliminate residual iPSCs rapidly and selectively in cell mixtures, substantially
enhancing its safety profile of transplantation of iPSC-derived cells and thereby improving the treatment of
various human diseases.",<Address><Affect><Alkaline Phosphatase><Biocompatible Materials><Biomaterials><Blood Precursor Cell><Cell Body><Cell Therapy><Cell Transplantation><Cells><Cellular Assay><Dephosphorylation><Development><Dysembryoma><Ensure><Environment><Enzyme Gene><Enzymes><Evaluation><Exhibits><Goals><Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells><Hematopoietic stem cells><Hour><Location><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modeling><Morphology><Murine><Mus><Normal Cell><Nuclear><Peptide Synthesis><Peptides><Performance><Phase><Photoreceptor Cell><Photoreceptors><Photosensitive Cell><Process><Progenitor Cells><Protein Cleavage><Protein Dephosphorylation><Proteolysis><Reaction><Reporting><Research><Residual><Residual state><Risk><Safety><Solid><Structure><Teratoid Tumor><Teratoma><Time><Transplantation><Tumorigenicity><Visual Receptor><alkaline phosphomonoesterase><biological material><blood cell progenitor><blood progenitor><blood stem cell><blood-forming stem cell><cell assay><cell mediated therapies><cell type><cell-based therapeutic><cell-based therapy><cellular therapeutic><cellular therapy><cellular transplant><clinical applicability><clinical application><clinical relevance><clinically relevant><cost><design><designing><determine efficacy><developmental><efficacy analysis><efficacy assessment><efficacy determination><efficacy evaluation><efficacy examination><evaluate efficacy><examine efficacy><glycerophosphatase><hematopoietic progenitor><hematopoietic stem progenitor cell><hemopoietic progenitor><hemopoietic stem cell><hiPSC><human disease><human iPS><human iPSC><human induced pluripotent cell><human induced pluripotent stem cells><human inducible stem cells><hypoimmunity><iPS><iPSC><iPSCs><immune deficiency><immunodeficiency><improved><in vivo><induced human pluripotent stem cells><induced pluripotent cell><induced pluripotent stem cell><inducible pluripotent stem cell><innovate><innovation><innovative><invention><mouse model><multidisciplinary><murine model><nano><new approaches><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><overexpress><overexpression><peptide L><personalization of treatment><personalized medicine><personalized therapy><personalized treatment><precursor cell><prevent><preventing><self assembly><side effect><spatiotemporal><stem cells><success><transplant><tumor><tumorigenic>,Biotechnology; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - Human; Transplantation
Investigating the role of gut-derived extracellular vesicles in PTSD following TBI,Investigating the role of gut-derived extracellular vesicles in PTSD following TBI,"Abstract
 Veterans and the general public with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have a high risk of developing
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression. The
pathophysiological basis that contributes to comorbid PTSD and other psychiatric disorders following TBI is not
yet understood, and there are currently few effective treatments for comorbid TBI/PTSD. Serotonergic
dysfunction and neuroinflammation are strongly associated with TBI and psychiatric disorders. Gut microbiota
dysfunction induces inflammation and affects tryptophan metabolism, a precursor of serotonin, which is
involved in serotonin biosynthesis. Studies conducted on patients with PTSD and other psychiatric disorders,
as well as mice exposed to experimental stress, have shown a high correlation between perturbation in gut
microbiota and mental disorders. TBI also induces gut microbiota dysbiosis. However, the cause-effect
relationship and the underlying mechanisms by which gut microbiota disruption following TBI impacts comorbid
PTSD and other psychiatric disorders are still largely unknown. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), small nanovesicles,
play a crucial role in cellular communication and carry various molecules. Bacterial EVs in the gut contain
bacterial genetic and biomaterials that are associated with virulence and considered causative agents in many
diseases, while EVs produced by select probiotics have great therapeutic potential. Our pilot data reveal that
administration of TBI-gut-EVs to gnotobiotic mice affects the expression of genes related to host serotonin
metabolites and neuroinflammation. In contrast, treatment of TBI animals with EVs derived from select probiotics
significantly increases host serotonin levels and alleviates psychiatric-like behavior. Based on our novel findings,
we hypothesize that the changes in gut microbiota-derived TBI-gut-EVs are involved in the regulation of
serotonergic neurons, neuroinflammation, and PTSD-like behavioral impairments following TBI. The successful
completion of this study will not only provide new insight into the pathogenesis of TBI, but also promote the
development of novel microbial-based therapy for preventing and/or treating comorbid TBI/PTSD, and potentially
other psychiatric disorders.",<5-HT><5-HT pathway><5-HT system><5-Hydroxytryptamine><5HT><APRF protein><Ablation><Acute-Phase Response Factor><Affect><Anabolism><Animals><Anxiety><Approaches to prevention><B breve><B. breve><Bacillus casei g><Bacillus g><Bacteria><Behavior><Betabacterium breve><Biocompatible Materials><Biomaterials><Brain Trauma><Cell Body><Cell to Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell-Cell Signaling><Cells><Communication><Data><Development><Diagnosis><Disease><Disorder><Dysfunction><Engineering><Enteramine><Equilibrium><Exposure to><Expression Signature><Feces><Functional disorder><GI microbiota><Gastrointestinal microbiota><Gene Expression><Gene Expression Profile><General Population><General Public><Gnotobiotic><Gnotobiotics><Hippophaine><Hortega cell><IL6-response factor><Immune response><Immunological response><Impairment><Incidence><Individual><Inflammation><Inflammatory Response><JAK-2><JAK2><JAK2 gene><JAK2 protein><Janus kinase 2><L breve><L brevis><L-Tryptophan><L. breve><L. brevis><LIF-response factor><Lactobacillus brevis><Lactobacterium breve><Levotryptophan><Macrophage><Mediating><Memory Deficit><Memory impairment><Mental Depression><Mental disorders><Mental health disorders><Mice><Mice Mammals><Microglia><Molecular><Murine><Mus><Mφ><Nerve Cells><Nerve Degeneration><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neuron Degeneration><Neurons><Non-Polyadenylated RNA><Occupational><PTSD><Pathogenesis><Pathway interactions><Patients><Physiopathology><Play><Post-Traumatic Neuroses><Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders><Posttraumatic Neuroses><Pre-Clinical Model><Preclinical Models><Prevention approach><Probiotics><Psychiatric Disease><Psychiatric Disorder><RNA><RNA Gene Products><Research><Ribonucleic Acid><Role><STAT3><STAT3 gene><Serotonergic System><Serotonin><Signal Pathway><Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3><Stat3 protein><Stress><TBI therapy><TBI treatment><Testing><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Effect><Transfer RNA><Transgenic Mice><Traumatic Brain Injury><Triplet Codon-Amino Acid Adaptor><Tryptophan><Tryptophan Metabolism><Tryptophan Metabolism Pathway><Tyrosine-Protein Kinase JAK2><Veterans><Virulence><anxiety-like behavior><bacterial genetics><balance><balance function><behavioral impairment><biological material><biosynthesis><co-morbid><co-morbidity><comorbidity><depression><developmental><dysbacteriosis><dysbiosis><dysbiotic><effective therapy><effective treatment><efficacious therapy><efficacious treatment><enteric microbial community><enteric microbiota><evidence base><extracellular vesicles><gastrointestinal microbial flora><gene expression pattern><gene expression signature><gitter cell><gut commensal><gut community><gut flora><gut microbe community><gut microbial community><gut microbial composition><gut microbial consortia><gut microbiota><gut microbiotic><gut microflora><high risk><host response><immune system response><immunoresponse><impaired behavior><insight><intercellular communication><intestinal flora><intestinal microbiota><intestinal microflora><intestinal tract microflora><memory dysfunction><mental illness><mesoglia><microbial><microbial based biotherapeutic><microbial based therapeutic><microbial based therapy><microbial based treatment><microbial imbalance><microbiota composition><microglial cell><microgliocyte><nano vesicle><nanovesicle><neural degeneration><neural inflammation><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neuroinflammation><neuroinflammatory><neurological degeneration><neuronal><neuronal degeneration><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new therapeutics><new therapy><next generation therapeutics><novel><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><pathophysiology><pathway><perivascular glial cell><post-trauma stress disorder><posttrauma stress disorder><prevent><preventing><psychiatric co-morbidity><psychiatric comorbidity><psychiatric illness><psychologic><psychological><psychological disorder><psychosocial><response><serotonergic pathway><serotonergic regulation><serotonin pathway><serotonin system><social role><stool><suicidal risk><suicide risk><tRNA><transcriptional profile><transcriptional signature><transfer Ribonucleic acids><traumatic brain damage><traumatic brain injury therapy><traumatic brain injury treatment><traumatic neurosis><vesicle release><vesicular release>,Anxiety Disorders; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Microbiome; Neurosciences; Physical Injury - Accidents and Adverse Effects; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI); Traumatic Head and Spine Injury
New biophysical and immunoregulatory mechanisms in neutrophil extracellular trap mediated lung dysfunction in cystic fibrosis,New biophysical and immunoregulatory mechanisms in neutrophil extracellular trap mediated lung dysfunction in cystic fibrosis,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mucus acts as a defensive barrier in the airways by trapping inhaled particles within a mucin gel network and
clearing them from the airway via mucociliary transport performed by the underlying airway epithelium. Muco-
obstructive airway diseases including cystic fibrosis (CF), asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
are caused by the buildup of thick mucus with an aberrant composition that is not able to be dynamically cleared,
resulting in occluded airways. Mucus accumulation also leads to chronic bacterial infection in the airways,
especially by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in CF patients. One abnormal component found in excess within the
mucus of patients with muco-obstructive diseases, most prominently in CF mucus, is neutrophil extracellular
traps (NETs). NETs are web-like complexes comprised mainly of decondensed chromatin intermixed with
neutrophilic granular proteins that are secreted extracellularly to capture and kill bacteria in a process known as
NETosis. DNase is currently used by CF patients to degrade the chromatin structure of NETs in the mucus but
often does not fully restore mucociliary transport in patients, indicating the granular components of NETs are
also likely involved in mucus dysfunction. In our previous research, we used a synthetic biomaterial model of the
chromatin structure of NETs to evaluate the effects on mucus biophysical properties and mucociliary transport
velocity. Building upon this, we propose to use both biomaterial and human airway tissue culture models to
pursue the following objectives: 1) determine how various granular proteins within NETs differentially affect
mucus biophysical properties and transportability across the airway epithelium, and 2) determine how the
alterations to mucin composition and glycosylation in CF mucus contribute to the increased NETosis observed.
For the first objective, we will employ similar synthetic NET biomaterial models, but incorporate neutrophilic
granular proteins into the formulation to evaluate their specific contributions in enhancing mucus viscosity and
decreasing mucociliary transport in CF airways. We will also account for the effects of inhaled DNase therapy
used by CF patients to determine if granular proteins continue to cause mucociliary transport dysfunction after
degradation of the chromatin scaffold of NETs. In the second objective, we will manipulate the expression of
secreted mucins and mucin glycosylation patterns of human airway tissue to understand how mucins and their
glycans modulate the activation of NETosis in neutrophils. We will account for the effects of P. aeruginosa
bacteria on mucin glycosylation to determine how NETosis is altered during infection in CF patients. This
research will identify novel anti-NET mucosal drug targets to prevent NETosis and neutralize the effects of NETs
in the airway mucus barrier. Ultimately, we believe this will lead to improved treatment of CF and other related
muco-obstructive lung diseases.",<Active Oxygen><Address><Affect><Apoptosis><Apoptosis Pathway><Asthma><Bacteria><Bacterial Infections><Biocompatible Materials><Biomaterials><Biophysics><Blood Neutrophil><Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil><Body Tissues><Bronchial Asthma><CF airway><CF infection><CF lung disease><CF mucus><CF patients><COPD><Chromatin><Chromatin Assembly><Chromatin Modeling><Chromatin Structure><Chronic><Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease><Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease><Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease><Chronic lung disease><Complex><Cystic Fibrosis><DNA><DNA Nucleases><DNase><Defect><Deoxyribonucleases><Deoxyribonucleic Acid><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Drug Targeting><Dysfunction><Electrostatics><Engineering><Epithelial Cells><Epithelium><Formulation><Functional disorder><Gel><Generalized Growth><Glycans><Glycoproteins><Granulocyte Elastase><Growth><Hemi-Myeloperoxidase><Histones><Human><Hyperviscosity><Immunomodulation><Impairment><In Vitro><Incubated><Infection><Inhalation><Inhaling><Internet><Lactoferrin><Lactotransferrin><Leukocyte Elastase><Life><Link><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Lysosomal Elastase><MG1><MUC5AC><MUC5AC gene><MUC5B><MUC5B gene><Marrow Neutrophil><Mediating><Metabolic Glycosylation><Modeling><Modern Man><Mucins><Mucociliary Clearance><Mucociliary Transport><Mucosa><Mucosal Tissue><Mucous Membrane><Mucous body substance><Mucoviscidosis><Mucus><Mucus Glycoprotein><Myeloperoxidase><N-Acetylneuraminic Acids><Neutrophil Activation><Neutrophil Elastase><Neutrophilic Granulocyte><Neutrophilic Leukocyte><Oxygen Radicals><P aeruginosa><P. aeruginosa><P. aeruginosa infection><PMN Elastase><Pathogenesis><Patients><Pattern><Peroxidases><Physiopathology><Polymorphonuclear Cell><Polymorphonuclear Leukocyte Elastase><Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes><Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils><Polysaccharides><Pro-Oxidants><Process><Production><Programmed Cell Death><Property><Protein Secretion><Proteins><Pseudomonas aeruginosa><Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection><Pseudomonas pyocyanea><Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis><Pyocyanin><Pyocyanine><Reactive Oxygen Species><Research><Respiratory Epithelium><Secretory Cell><Sialic Acids><Structure of respiratory epithelium><Therapeutic><Thick><Thickness><Tissue Growth><Tissues><Up-Regulation><Upregulation><Viscosity><WWW><Work><airflow limitation><airflow obstruction><airway epithelium><airway limitation><airway obstruction><bacteria infection><bacterial disease><biological material><biophysical characteristics><biophysical characterization><biophysical foundation><biophysical measurement><biophysical parameters><biophysical principles><biophysical properties><biophysical sciences><cervicovaginal><chronic infection><chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder><chronic pulmonary disease><crosslink><cystic fibrosis airway><cystic fibrosis infection><cystic fibrosis lung><cystic fibrosis lung disease><cystic fibrosis mucus><cystic fibrosis patients><design><designing><differential expression><differentially expressed><extracellular><glycosylation><human tissue><immune modulation><immune regulation><immunologic reactivity control><immunomodulatory><immunoregulation><immunoregulatory><improved><individuals with CF><individuals with cystic fibrosis><infected with P. aeruginosa><infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa><infection in CF><infection in cystic fibrosis><lung function><lung function decline><middle ear><muco obstructive lung diseases><muco-obstructive airway diseases><mucoobstructive lung diseases><mucous><mucus-associated lung diseases><neutrophil><new drug target><new drug treatments><new druggable target><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new pharmacotherapy target><new therapeutic target><new therapeutics><new therapy><new therapy target><next generation therapeutics><novel><novel drug target><novel drug treatments><novel druggable target><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel pharmacotherapy target><novel therapeutic target><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><novel therapy target><obstructed airflow><obstructed airway><ontogeny><particle><pathophysiology><patients with CF><patients with cystic fibrosis><persistent infection><prevent><preventing><protein complex><pulmonary><pulmonary function><pulmonary function decline><respiratory airway obstruction><respiratory tract epithelium><response><scaffold><scaffolding><sialyl Lewis x><sialyl-Lex><tissue culture><transcriptional differences><viscoelasticity><web><world wide web>,Cystic Fibrosis; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Rare Diseases
Engineered Cytokine-Secreting Bacteria to Treat Periodontitis.,Engineered Cytokine-Secreting Bacteria to Treat Periodontitis.,"PROJECT
SUMMARY.
Periodontitis is one of the most prevalent diseases and a leading cause of tooth loss. In the United States,
approximately 61 million adults over 30 years old have periodontitis (42.2%) with 7.8% having severe
periodontitis. A disproportionate host response and dysbiotic microbiota are the two major etiologic factors. The
standard treatment, mechanical debridement, to remove biofilm has limited clinical efficacy in patients with
dysregulated immune responses. There is a critical need for novel host modulation therapies with safe, localized,
and effective delivery characteristics to treat periodontitis. Recent advances in synthetic biology have presented
new opportunities to use genetically-engineered bacteria for disease treatment. In particular, our team has
developed genetic tools to program the commercial human probiotic Limosilactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) to
secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines to treat inflammatory bowel diseases. Furthermore, we have increased the
viability and efficacy of these engineered L. reuteri by encapsulating them in biocompatible biomaterials. These
novel biotechnological approaches can be effective in treating periodontitis. The goal of this project is to develop
a biomaterial-enhanced system for targeted localization of engineered microbes releasing therapeutic
molecules, an “oral micro-drug factory”, effective for host modulation and tissue healing. Our objective is to locally
administer engineered L. reuteri secreting the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10), to evaluate the
phenotypic and molecular effects in experimental periodontitis models. The hypothesis is that localized and
sustained delivery of IL-10 from well-contained L. reuteri can reduce periodontal inflammation and promote
periodontal tissue healing. We will achieve our goals through two specific aims: (1) Validate the ability of
engineered L. reuteri producing IL-10 to treat experimental periodontitis; (2) Use a microneedle patch to localize
L. reuteri and enable boosted potency delivery of IL-10 to treat specific areas of experimental periodontitis. Well-
established methods will be used to analyze local and systemic immune responses and oral microbiota shifts in
these periodontitis-affected animals treated with this novel approach. The outcomes of this project will
demonstrate that localized host modulation through the biomaterial-based application of engineered L. reuteri
can treat experimental periodontitis. Encapsulation of bacteria in the stable and biocompatible microneedle patch
attached to the gingiva will improve their effectiveness without allowing L. reuteri to become the dominant oral
species. This will shed light on novel clinical applications of engineered microorganisms able to achieve
localized, sustained host modulation in treating periodontitis using a combinatorial strategy of biomaterials and
synthetic biology.",<21+ years old><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><Alginates><Alveolar Bone Loss><Alveolar Resorption><Animals><Anti-Inflammatories><Anti-Inflammatory Agents><Anti-inflammatory><Area><Bacteria><Biocompatible Materials><Biomaterials><Biotech><Biotechnology><Blood><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Body Tissues><Bone Inflammation><Buccal Cavity><Buccal Cavity Head and Neck><CSIF><CSIF-10><Causality><Cavitas Oris><Cell Body><Cells><Characteristics><Chronic Periodontitis><Clinical><Cytokine Synthesis Inhibitory Factor><Debridement><Diet><Disease><Disorder><Dose><Drugs><Effectiveness><Encapsulated><Engineering><Etiology><Frequencies><Gel><Genes><Genetic><Genetic Engineering><Genetic Engineering Biotechnology><Genetic Engineering Molecular Biology><Gingiva><Gingival><Goals><Human><Hydrogels><IL-10><IL10><IL10A><Immune><Immune response><Immunes><Immunological response><Inflammation><Inflammatory Bowel Diseases><Inflammatory Bowel Disorder><Interleukin 10 Precursor><Interleukin-10><Ligature><Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm><Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor><Malignant Oral Neoplasm><Measures><Mechanics><Medication><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Microbe><Microbial Biofilms><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><Mouth><Mouth Cancer><Mouth Diseases><Murine><Mus><NHANES><National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey><Needles><Oral><Oral Cancer><Oral Cavity Disease><Oral Cavity Disorder><Oral Disease><Oral Disorder><Oral cavity><Osteitis><Outcome><Parodontosis><Pathogenesis><Patients><Periodontal Bone Loss><Periodontal Diseases><Periodontal Resorption><Periodontitis><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phenotype><Pre-Clinical Model><Preclinical Models><Probiotics><Proteins><Recombinant DNA Technology><Severities><Site><System><Testing><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Agents><Tissues><Tooth><Tooth Loss><Tooth structure><United States><adulthood><alveolar bone><alveolar supporting bone><biocompatibility><biofilm><biological material><biomaterial compatibility><causation><chronic inflammatory disease><clinical applicability><clinical application><clinical efficacy><combinatorial><cytokine><diets><disease causation><drug/agent><dysbacteriosis><dysbiosis><dysbiotic><genetically engineered><healing><host response><immune system response><immunoresponse><improved><inflamed bone><inflammation marker><inflammatory disease of the intestine><inflammatory disorder of the intestine><inflammatory marker><intestinal autoinflammation><malignant mouth neoplasm><malignant mouth tumor><maxilla alveolar process><mechanic><mechanical><microbial><microbial consortia><microbial flora><microbial imbalance><microbiota><microflora><microorganism><mouse model><mouth disorder><multispecies consortia><murine model><new approaches><novel><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><oral cavity cancer><oral microbial community><oral microbiota><oral microflora><periodontal disorder><periodontium disease><periodontium disorder><polydimethylsiloxane><pre-clinical><preclinical><programs><side effect><socket wall><standard care><standard treatment><synthetic biology><teeth><tool>,"Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Disease; Infectious Diseases; Microbiome"
Biomaterials for delivery and maintenance of tip endothelial cells,Biomaterials for delivery and maintenance of tip endothelial cells,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The mortality rates for patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) are 15-40%, depending on the treatment.
Moreover, the quality of life for surviving patients remains severely reduced. Limb revascularization focused on
limb rescue is critical to saving lives and life quality. Cell therapy strategies currently under investigation inject a
variety of progenitor cells into ischemic tissue with varying levels of success. However, no one has examined
the ability of angiogenic tip-specific endothelial cells (ECs) to promote revascularization in an ischemic limb. We
hypothesize that angiogenic ECs that contain tip ECs will more robustly revascularize ischemic limbs compared
with nonangiogenic ECs. The proposed studies will use highly expandable pluripotent stem cells as the starting
cell source and derive tip and non-tip cell-containing ECs from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. We
will then compare the ability of tip ECs versus non-tip ECs to rescue the muscle in a hind-limb ischemic mouse
model. For delivery, we employ spatially nanopatterned collagen biomaterial scaffolds to enhance cell survival
after transplantation into the ischemic limb. Lastly, we will incorporate placental growth factor (PIGF) mRNA
delivery from aligned nanopatterned collagen biomaterials to support the release of PlGF protein for maintaining
the angiogenic phenotype of tip ECs, and/or directing in vivo the differentiation of stalk-to-tip ECs. We expect
these studies to show that angiogenic tip-specific ECs, not only integrate into and support current vasculature in
the ischemic limb, but also initiate the growth of new blood vessels, faster re-establishment of tissue perfusion,
and reproducibly rescue the ischemic limb.",<Address><Amputation><Angioplasty><Biocompatible Materials><Biomaterials><Blood Vessels><Body Tissues><Bypass><Cell Body><Cell Survival><Cell Therapy><Cell Viability><Cells><Clinical Trials><Collagen><Death Rate><Endothelial Cells><Extremities><Hindlimb><Investigation><Ischemia><Limb structure><Limbs><Maintenance><Medical><Mice><Mice Mammals><Murine><Mus><Muscle><Muscle Tissue><Non-Trunk><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><PGF gene><PLGF-2><Patients><Perfusion><Phenotype><PlGF><PlGF protein><Placental Growth Factor><Pluripotent Stem Cells><Population><Procedures><Progenitor Cells><QOL><Quality of Life Assessment><Quality of life><Reproducibility><Source><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><Tissues><Transplantation><biological material><biomaterial scaffold><bioscaffold><cell mediated therapies><cell-based therapeutic><cell-based therapy><cellular therapeutic><cellular therapy><critical limb Ischemia><deliver mRNA><deliver messenger RNA><delivery system for mRNA><hiPSC><human iPS><human iPSC><human induced pluripotent cell><human induced pluripotent stem cells><human inducible stem cells><iPS><iPSC><iPSCs><improved><in vivo><induced human pluripotent stem cells><induced pluripotent cell><induced pluripotent stem cell><inducible pluripotent stem cell><intraluminal angioplasty><ischemic limb><limb ischemia><mRNA delivery><messenger RNA delivery><mortality rate><mortality ratio><mouse model><murine model><muscular><nano pattern><nanopattern><new growth><placenta growth factor><pluripotent progenitor><product placenta growth factor><revascularization><stem cells><success><surgery><transplant><vascular>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Nanotechnology; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - Human
Modeling the mucosal glycopeptide mesh for improved disease understanding and mucin-inspired biomaterial design,Modeling the mucosal glycopeptide mesh for improved disease understanding and mucin-inspired biomaterial design,"ABSTRACT
Mucins and other densely glycosylated proteins play critical roles in a number of biological processes, disease
conditions, and therapeutics. The functioning of these sugar-coated molecular machines depends on their
structure, dynamics, and conformational transitions. Experimental techniques for capturing such structural
dynamics, however, can be extremely challenging and resource intensive. We seek to improve upon some of
the existing glycan modeling computational tools as well as design new in silico techniques, as robust alternatives
to experimental studies. These tools will be used to build interconnected mucin glycoprotein gel systems with
native glycosylation patterns, and obtain understanding of functional underpinnings at the molecular level. Effects
of perturbations in terms of pH variance, varying glycosylation patterns, and charge distribution changes will be
investigated. This will enable detailed comprehension of the physical properties of mucins that drive their
function, as well as the molecular elucidation of disease conditions of cystic fibrosis, mucosal inflammation, and
mucin-mediated cancers. A multi-modal approach will be employed to study these mucin networks in different
scales – (i) first-principles based atomistic modeling to capture the equilibrium structure-dynamics; (ii)
biophysics-based coarse-grained methods to describe bulk properties and transitions, and (iii) data-driven
machine learning approaches to predict topology and intermolecular interactions. Inspired from mucosal gels,
we will use these tools to design novel mucin-like nanomaterials constructed from glycan-peptide heteropolymer

"Mimicking, Exploiting, and Understanding Biology's Heterogeneity in 4D","Mimicking, Exploiting, and Understanding Biology's Heterogeneity in 4D","PROJECT SUMMARY
Our bodies consist of an exquisite collection of tissues and organs that undergo constant change. From
morphogenesis and homeostasis to the progression of disease, these changes are associated with both the
healthy and unhealthy processes that define human life. My research program at the University of Washington
is developing robust and uniquely powerful multidisciplinary methodologies to mimic, exploit, and quantify
these changes, particularly as they evolve in both time and 3D space (i.e., 4D). In our lab’s first five years of
existence, we have: (1) developed a suite of synthetic cell-culture platforms whose biochemical and
biophysical properties can be reversibly modulated in 4D using cytocompatible photochemistries, and have
utilized these platforms to regulate proliferation, migration, differentiation, and intracellular signaling at single-
and sub-cellular resolutions; (2) introduced a photodegradable material-based approach to generate the first
endothelialized 3D vascular networks within cell-laden hydrogel biomaterials that span nearly all size scales of
native human vasculature (including capillaries); (3) reported the first modular framework for imparting
biomaterials with precise degradative responsiveness to multiple environmental cues/biomarkers following
user-programmable Boolean logic; and (4) established the first tools for “spatiotemporally resolved
proteomics”, enabling visualization and quantification of proteins produced in vitro and in vivo within user-
defined regions in 4D. The present proposal expands our group’s capabilities in each of these areas, paving
the way to new therapeutic targets and treatments of disease through a fundamentally transformed knowledge
of basic cell physiology. In this project, we will: (1) exploit our 4D-tunable biomaterials to recapitulate and probe
cardiovascular developmental signaling in vitro, examining the manner in which precise spatial and temporal
presentation of signaling proteins culminates in orchestrated differentiation; (2) employ synthetic capillaries to
examine drug action and resistance, screen therapeutics, and investigate microvascular occlusion, thrombosis,
and altered remodeling that occurs in many hematologic diseases (e.g., sickle cell anemia, spherocytosis); (3)
develop and deploy hydrogel nanoparticles exhibiting logic-based degradative response to cancer-presented
biomarkers to deliver small molecule chemotherapeutics to tumors with unprecedented specificity; and (4)
extend our 4D proteomic strategies to permit optically and physiologically defined proteomic mapping in living
tissue and model organisms. Critically, the methods that we are developing and implementing are cell-, tissue-,
and disease-agnostic, enabling enhanced understanding of a wide variety of biological processes while laying
the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.",<3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><Area><Autoregulation><Biochemical><Biocompatible Materials><Biological Function><Biological Markers><Biological Process><Biology><Biomaterials><Blood Diseases><Blood Vessels><Blood capillaries><Body Tissues><Cancers><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Culture Techniques><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Cues><Development><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Drug resistance><Endothelium><Event><Exhibits><Foundations><Hb SS disease><HbSS disease><Heart Vascular><Hematologic Diseases><Hematological Disease><Hematological Disorder><Hemoglobin S Disease><Hemoglobin sickle cell disease><Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder><Heterogeneity><Homeostasis><Human><Hydrogels><In Vitro><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Knowledge><Life><Logic><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Maps><Methodology><Methods><Modern Man><Morphogenesis><Optics><Organ><Photochemistry><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiological Homeostasis><Prevention><Process><Proliferating><Proteins><Proteomics><Reporting><Research><Resolution><Sickle Cell Anemia><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Signaling Factor Proto-Oncogene><Signaling Pathway Gene><Signaling Protein><Specificity><Subcellular Process><Therapeutic><Thrombosis><Time><Tissue Banks><Tissue Collection><Tissue repository><Tissues><Universities><Visualization><Washington><bio-markers><biologic marker><biological material><biological signal transduction><biomarker><biophysical characteristics><biophysical characterization><biophysical measurement><biophysical parameters><biophysical properties><blood disorder><capillary><cell culture><cell cultures><circulatory system><developmental><disease diagnosis><drug action><drug resistant><in vivo><malignancy><migration><model organism><morphogenetic process><multidisciplinary><nano particle><nano-sized particle><nanoparticle><nanosized particle><neoplasm/cancer><new drug target><new druggable target><new pharmacotherapy target><new therapeutic target><new therapy target><novel drug target><novel druggable target><novel pharmacotherapy target><novel therapeutic target><novel therapy target><optical><programs><resistance to Drug><resistant to Drug><resolutions><response><sickle cell disease><sickle cell disorder><sickle disease><sicklemia><small molecule><spatiotemporal><three dimensional><thrombotic disease><thrombotic disorder><tool><tumor><vascular>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Hematology; Nanotechnology; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Sickle Cell Disease; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Embryonic - Human
Tuning multivalency for optimized ligand presentation,Tuning multivalency for optimized ligand presentation,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cells probe their biophysical environment by engaging multiple ligands on the extracellular matrix and in solution
resulting in receptor oligomerization and clustering at the nanoscale. In the fields of biomaterials science and
nanomedicine, there is a significant need to recreate these complex dynamics by presenting ligands from a
synthetic substrate with optimal presentation. However, it is very challenging to develop sufficient design criteria
at this nano-bio interface due in part to the complexity of the interactions as well as our insufficient ability to
precisely control these macromolecular features. We seek to address this fundamental limitation by developing
quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models that will allow us to accurately shape synthetic
multivalent ligands with optimized biophysical dynamics for programmable cell signaling. Our approach
significantly leverages a new combinatorial platform developed by the PI to precisely fine tune and study these
challenging interactions. To do this, our research program has five major thrusts. Thrust 1: Leveraging our
automated platform for multivalent ligand synthesis, we will study the spectrum of available hydrodynamic
characteristics and learn how to control their structure with high precision. Thrust 2: We will use molecular
dynamic (MD) simulations to help us define these macromolecular features then build QSAR models to extract
design criteria. Thrust 3: Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and super-resolution microscopy, we will
probe ligand-receptor interactions and characterize the macromolecular contributions towards avidity, specificity,
cooperativity and super-selectivity. Thrust 4: The implications of these features on cell signaling and ligand
directed cell behavior will be characterized. Thrust 5: We will apply this new knowledge to a variety of
applications including regenerative medicine, nanomedicine and as probes to study signal transduction. These
five major thrusts were developed to complement each other towards our long-term goals for developing highly
bioactive and customizable ligands for programed cell behavior.",<Address><Attention><Avidity><Biocompatible Materials><Biomaterials><Biophysics><Bone Formation><Cell Body><Cell Communication><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Interaction><Cell Signaling><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cell-to-Cell Interaction><Cells><Characteristics><Complement><Complement Proteins><Complex><ECM><Environment><Extracellular Matrix><Goals><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Knowledge><Learning><Ligands><Modeling><Molecular Dynamics Simulation><Osteogenesis><Physical Chemistry><QSAR><Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship><Quantitiative Structure Activity Relationship><Receptor Protein><Regenerative Medicine><Research><Reverse engineering><Science><Shapes><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Specificity><Structure><Surface Plasmon Resonance><Work><biological material><biological signal transduction><biophysical foundation><biophysical principles><biophysical sciences><bone tissue formation><cell behavior><cellular behavior><combinatorial><complementation><design><designing><molecular dynamics><nano><nano medicinal><nano medicine><nano meter scale><nano meter sized><nanomedicinal><nanomedicine><nanometer scale><nanometer sized><nanoscale><programs><receptor><response><superresolution microscopy>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Nanotechnology
Nanofiber Patch with Gradient Presentation of Biomolecules for Treatment of Pediatric Tracheal Stenosis,Nanofiber Patch with Gradient Presentation of Biomolecules for Treatment of Pediatric Tracheal Stenosis,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term objective of this application is to bring a trachea patch to the market for treatment of pediatric
tracheal stenosis, or narrowing of the airway, which left untreated can be a life-threatening condition. Currently,
otolaryngologists have only two major options for treating tracheal stenosis. One is a complex surgical procedure
known as slide tracheoplasty that few surgeons in the country are qualified to perform. The other is to cut and
splay the trachea holding it open using a graft of rib cartilage. Both are difficult, time-consuming procedures with
potential complications. We have an issued U.S. patent on the trachea patch biomaterial that overcomes the five
major technical hurdles required to replace rib cartilage grafting: 1) mechanical integrity, 2) suturable, 3)
resorbable, 4) air-tight, and 5) off-the-shelf. There is currently nothing on the market remotely resembling the
idea of a synthetic patch for tracheal stenosis. While the academic tissue engineering community has focused
primarily on regenerating an entire trachea with highly complex strategies, arguably leading to technology in
search of an application, we have focused instead on identifying a specific patient indication with an unmet need
and designed a technology to fill that void.
 The overall hypothesis is that mimicking the wound healing environment using reinforced electrospun
scaffolds with gradient presentation of biological factors will maintain tracheal patency and regenerate cartilage-
like tissue comparable to healthy tracheas. Two specific aims are proposed to determine the most attractive
growth factor loading for mimicking specific stages of wound healing. Aim 1 will refine growth factor loading by
evaluating multiple compositions in a subcutaneous model. The final device composition will then be evaluated
in a capstone in vivo rabbit tracheal defect study in Aim 2.
 Compared to rib cartilage grafting, our trachea patch holds the following advantages: 1) No surgery to remove
rib tissue, saving operating room time and cost, and eliminating potential complication/infection and morbidity at
the rib site (attractive to patients and insurance companies), 2) Easy to use, as it is “plug and play” for surgeons
who perform rib cartilage grafting (attractive to surgeons), 3) The gradient design has the potential to improve
functionality and accelerate regeneration, promoting vascularization, macrophage recruitment, and directed
matrix synthesis. For several reasons, we focus initial clinical translation on the pediatric population with
laryngotracheal stenosis. In the simplest terms, our goal is to fix tracheas for young children around the world
with narrowed airways to help them survive and breathe normally again.","<0-11 years old><3-D print><3-D printer><3D Print><3D printer><3D printing><Acceleration><Address><Age><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Area><Award><BMP7><BMP7 gene><Biocompatible Materials><Biologic Factor><Biological Factors><Biomaterials><Blood Vessels><Body Tissues><Breathing><Breeding><CCL2><CCL2 gene><Cartilage><Cartilaginous Tissue><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Count><Cell Number><Cell Signaling><Cells><Chemokine, CC Motif, Ligand 2><Child><Child Youth><Childhood><Children (0-21)><Communities><Complex><Complication><Consumption><Country><Defect><Devices><Diamond><Domestic Rabbit><Encapsulated><Environment><Event><Fiber><Flow Cytofluorometries><Flow Cytofluorometry><Flow Cytometry><Flow Microfluorimetry><Flow Microfluorometry><Funding><Goals><Growth Agents><Growth Factor><Growth Substances><Guided Tissue Regeneration><Harvest><Heart><Histology><Homing><Individual><Industry Collaboration><Industry Collaborators><Infection><Inflammatory><Injury><Insurance><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Knee><Left><Legal patent><Life><Literature><MCAF><MCP-1><MCP1><Macrophage><Marketing><Mechanics><Methods><Modeling><Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1><Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1><Monocyte Chemotactic and Activating Factor><Monocyte Chemotactic and Activating Protein><Monocyte Chemotactive and Activating Factor><Monocyte Secretory Protein JE><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Morphology><Mφ><NIH><Nanofiber Scaffold><National Institutes of Health><Natural regeneration><Nature><OP1><Operating Rooms><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Organ><Oryctolagus cuniculus><Osteogenic Protein 1><Otolaryngologist><Otomy><Pain><Painful><Patents><Pathologic Constriction><Pathological Constriction><Patients><Phase><Play><Population><Procedures><Proteins><Proteins Growth Factors><QOL><Qualifying><Quality of life><Rabbits><Rabbits Mammals><Recovery><Regeneration><Respiratory Aspiration><Respiratory Inspiration><Ribs><SBIR><SCYA2><Secondary to><Shapes><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Signaling Factor Proto-Oncogene><Signaling Pathway Gene><Signaling Protein><Site><Skin><Slide><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Small Inducible Cytokine A2><Stenosis><Surgeon><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><Surgical complication><Surgical incisions><TGF-Beta-3><TGF-beta3><TGF-β3><Technology><Testing><Time><Tissue Engineering><Tissues><Trachea><Trachea Proper><Tracheal Stenosis><Transforming Growth Factor Beta 3><United States National Institutes of Health><VEGF><VEGFs><Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors><Vascularization><Wound Repair><X-ray microtomography><Xray microtomography><ages><angiogenesis><bioengineered tissue><biological material><biological signal transduction><blood vessel development><blood vessel formation><bone><bone morphogenetic protein 7><cartilage graft><cartilage regeneration><cartilage transplant><cartilage transplantation><clinical translation><clinically translatable><controlled release><cost><cytokine><design><designing><engineered tissue><fabrication><flow cytophotometry><healing><improved><in vivo><incision><injuries><inspiration><kids><mechanic><mechanical><micro CT><micro computed tomography><microCT><microtomography><model of animal><mouse model><murine model><nanofiber><nanofiber patch><nanofibrous><next generation><pediatric><reconstruction><recruit><regenerate><regenerate new tissue><regenerate tissue><regenerating damaged tissue><regenerating tissue><regeneration potential><regenerative potential><repair><repaired><response><rib bone structure><scaffold><scaffolding><sex><standard of care><stem><subcutaneous><subdermal><surgery><surgery complication><three dimensional printing><tissue regeneration><tissue regrowth><tissue renewal><tissue specific regeneration><transforming growth factor beta3><transforming growth factor β3><vascular><windpipe><wound healing><wound recovery><wound resolution><youngster>",Bioengineering; Lung; Nanotechnology; Pediatric; Regenerative Medicine
Tissue-engineered trachea composites for long-segment airway replacement (DIVERSITY SUPP - Hussein),Tissue-engineered trachea composites for long-segment airway replacement (DIVERSITY SUPP - Hussein),"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pediatric long-segment airway defects are caused by congenital malformations or result from trauma,
infection, or malignancy. Although rare, these defects are often fatal. There is currently no established surgical
technique to repair long-segment tracheal defects and the reconstructive options remain heroic. Tissue
engineering has the potential to replace failed tissue with a normal, living organ. Despite its potential, clinical
outcomes of tissue engineered tracheal grafts (TETG) have been poor.
 The main barriers to translation of tracheal replacement are graft collapse and delayed epithelialization.
We assessed the performance of partially decellularized tracheal grafts (PDTG) in our mouse model of orthotopic
tracheal replacement. Using resorbable biomaterials to stabilize PDTG, we created a Composite Tracheal Graft
(CTG). We hypothesize the CTG can improve overall survival in long-segment tracheal replacement, attenuate
graft collapse, promote extracellular matrix (ECM) production and SAE differentiation.
 To test this hypothesis, we will first assess how CTG promotes ECM regeneration in the tracheal
cartilage. In our first aim, we will implant PDTG and CTG in a mouse model of tracheal replacement and quantify
ECM production and mechanical properties. Using a conditional knock-out of chondrocyte-mediated ECM
production, we will then assess the impact on graft chondrocytes on ECM production. In our second aim, we will
define how SAE differentiation is promoted by CTG. We hypothesize that modification of graft dimensions with
splinting reduces wall shear stress (WSS) resulting in improved epithelial differentiation. To test the effect of
WSS on SAE differentiation, we will implant PDTG and CTG of normal and small diameter, thus increasing WSS
by reducing graft radius. To quantify WSS, we will use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to topographically
map WSS through the grafts and correlate these values with quantitative immunofluorescenceof neo-epithelium.
Finally, we will validate CTG performance in an ovine model of tracheal replacement in our third aim. Using
routine radiographic and endoscopic surveillance, we will quantify animal survival, clinical manifestations, graft
dimensions, and graft regeneration.
 This proposal advances the field of airway tissue engineering through the development of a composite
tissue engineered tracheal graft and defining the mechanical factors contributing to graft regeneration.",<0-11 years old><3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><Acceleration><Address><Air Movements><Airway surgery><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Animals><Attenuated><Autograft><Autologous><Autologous Transplantation><Autotransplant><Biocompatible Materials><Biological><Biomaterials><Biomechanics><Biopsy><Birth Defects><Body Tissues><Bronchi><Bronchoscopy><Cancers><Cartilage><Cartilaginous Tissue><Cell Body><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cells><Child><Child Youth><Childhood><Children (0-21)><Chondrocytes><Chondrogenesis><Clinical><Clinical Management><Complex><Congenital Abnormality><Congenital Anatomical Abnormality><Congenital Defects><Congenital Deformity><Congenital Malformation><Defect><Detection><Development><Diameter><Dimensions><Disease><Disorder><Domestic Rabbit><ECM><Epithelial Cells><Epithelium><Expression Profiling><Extracellular Matrix><Generalized Growth><Generations><Growth><Host Defense><Image><Implant><Infection><Inflammation><Injury><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Legal patent><Liquid substance><Maintenance><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Maps><Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis><Mass Spectrometry><Mass Spectroscopy><Mass Spectrum><Mass Spectrum Analyses><Mass Spectrum Analysis><Mechanics><Mediating><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modeling><Modification><Mucociliary Clearance><Mucociliary Transport><Murine><Mus><Natural regeneration><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Organ><Oryctolagus cuniculus><Outcome><Patents><Patients><Performance><Population><Production><Public Health><Rabbits><Rabbits Mammals><Radial><Radiography><Radius><Regeneration><Respiratory Epithelium><Roentgenography><Role><Source><Splint Device><Splints><Structure of respiratory epithelium><Surface><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><Techniques><Testing><Time><Tissue Engineering><Tissue Growth><Tissues><Trachea><Trachea Proper><Tracheal Diseases><Tracheal Disorder><Trauma><Work><air flow><airflow><airflow limitation><airflow obstruction><airway epithelium><airway limitation><airway obstruction><attenuate><attenuates><autologous graft><autotransplantation><barrier to translation><biocompatibility><bioengineered tissue><biologic><biological material><biomaterial compatibility><biomechanical><cartilaginous><clinical translation><clinically translatable><conditional knock-out><conditional knockout><developmental><efficacy testing><engineered tissue><epithelium regeneration><extracellular><fluid><imaging><implantation><improved><injuries><innovate><innovation><innovative><interventional strategy><kids><liquid><malignancy><mechanic><mechanical><mechanical properties><model of animal><mouse model><murine model><neoplasm/cancer><obstacle to translation><obstructed airflow><obstructed airway><ontogeny><ovine animal model><ovine model><parent award><parent project><pediatric><preservation><progenitor><protein expression><radiologic imaging><radiological imaging><regenerate><regenerate epithelium><repair><repaired><replacement tissue><respiratory airway obstruction><respiratory surgery><respiratory tract epithelium><restoration><shear stress><sheep model><social role><stem><stress reduction><surgery><three dimensional><translation barrier><translation obstacle><translational barrier><translational obstacle><windpipe><youngster>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Lung; Regenerative Medicine
Biomaterial Scaffolds for Ex Vivo and In Situ CAR-T Cell Production,Biomaterial Scaffolds for Ex Vivo and In Situ CAR-T Cell Production,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite unprecedented clinical success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy against tumors,
widespread application is limited by lengthy and labor-intensive ex vivo manufacturing procedures that result
in: (i) very high costs of therapy of up to half of a million dollars; (ii) delays of weeks or months to infuse CAR-T
cells to patients with rapidly progressing disease; and (iii) heterogeneous composition and terminal
differentiation of infused CAR-T cells as a result of ex vivo culture that limit CAR-T cell engraftment and
persistence. Effort to overcome these limitations have focused on closed and automatic manufacturing devices
to contain the labor needed to manufacture CAR-T cells ex vivo, and allogeneic off-the-shelf CAR-T cells have
been proposed to overcome the need of CAR-T cell manufacturing for each single patient. Despite significant
achievements in this space, reducing the time, costs and regulatory burden remains a deep unmet need in
CAR-T cell therapy and significant reducing or eliminating ex vivo procedures remains a critical unmet need. In
vivo generation of CAR-T cells would eliminate the need for ex vivo procedures, prevent the terminal
differentiation of ex vivo expanded CAR-T cells and ensure the potency and longevity of autologous T cells as
compared to allogeneic CAR-T cell products that are extensively manipulated to prevent rejection and graft-
versus-host disease The research outlined in this proposal develops new biomaterials approaches to reduce
the time and effort to produce CAR-T cells in vitro, to enhance CAR-T cell efficacy and persistence in vivo and,
finally, to eliminate ex vivo manipulation entirely by generating CAR-T cells entirely within the patient. We
propose that biomaterial scaffolds displaying anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and releasing pro-proliferative
interleukins will mediate simultaneous activation and viral transduction of T cells without centrifugation
(spinoculation) or transduction agents (retronectin, polybrene) and will facilitate ex vivo genetic reprogramming
of T cells by reducing the time and expense of activating naive T-cells and transducing them with viral vectors.
We next propose that directly implanting scaffolds seeded with peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CAR-
encoding viral vectors will promote release of CAR-T cells into circulation, eliminating ex vivo CAR-T isolation
and proliferation protocols to promote a less differentiated cell phenotype associated with longer in vivo
persistence. Finally, we propose that, through the inclusion of encapsulated T-cell attracting cytokines,
implanted biomaterial scaffolds will generate CAR-T cells entirely in situ through recruitment of host T cells to
the scaffold, in-scaffold reprogramming of recruited T cells with resident CAR-encoding viral vectors, and
release of reprogrammed CAR-T cells. We expect that our results will provide a basis for a general cellular
therapeutic strategy and promote widespread patient access. In addition to the obvious applications in blood
cancers, this rational materials-based approach for cellular manufacturing will be adopted to program
therapeutic lymphocytes in solid tumors and for other diseases.",<3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><Achievement><Achievement Attainment><Adopted><Alginates><Allogenic><Antibodies><Architecture><Assay><Autologous><B cell malignancy><B lymphoid malignancy><Bioassay><Biocompatible Materials><Biological Assay><Biomaterials><CAR T cell therapy><CAR T cells><CAR T therapy><CAR modified T cells><CAR-T><CAR-Ts><CD28><CD28 gene><CD3><CD3 Antigens><CD3 Complex><CD3 molecule><CRG-2><CXCL10><CXCL10 gene><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Count><Cell Differentiation><Cell Differentiation process><Cell Function><Cell Number><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Reprogramming><Cell Signaling><Cell Therapy><Cell-Mediated Lympholytic Cells><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Cellular biology><Centrifugation><Centrifugation Fractionation><Characteristics><Circulation><Clinical><Clinical Data><Co-Stimulator><Co-culture><Cocultivation><Coculture><Coculture Techniques><Costimulator><Cytolytic T-Cell><Cytotoxic T Cell><Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes><Data><Devices><Disease><Disorder><Dose><Drug Delivery><Drug Delivery Systems><Encapsulated><Engineering><Engineering / Architecture><Engraftment><Ensure><Epidermal Thymocyte Activating Factor><Generations><Genetic><Germinoblastic Sarcoma><Germinoblastoma><Goals><GvHD><Hematopoietic Cell Tumor><Hematopoietic Malignancies><Hematopoietic Neoplasms><Hematopoietic Neoplasms including Lymphomas><Hematopoietic Tumor><Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Cell Neoplasm><Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasms><Homologous Wasting Disease><IFI10><IL-2><IL2 Protein><INP10><IP-10><Immune system><Implant><In Situ><In Vitro><Interleukin 2><Interleukin 2 Precursor><Interleukin II><Interleukin-2><Interleukine 2><Interleukine 2 Precursor><Interleukine II><Interleukins><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Kinetics><Length of Life><Lentiviral Vector><Lentivirinae><Lentivirus><Lentivirus Vector><Longevity><Lymphatic cell><Lymphocyte><Lymphocyte Mitogenic Factor><Lymphocytic><Lymphoma><MOB-1><Malignant Hematopoietic Neoplasm><Malignant Lymphoma><Mediating><Medical><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Mitogenic Factor><Modeling><Murine><Mus><OKT3 antigen><PBMC><Patients><Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell><Phenotype><Physiologic><Physiological><Polybrene><Porosity><Procedures><Process><Production><Proliferating><Proteins><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Research><Reticulolymphosarcoma><Retroviral Vector><Retrovirus Vector><Runt Disease><SCYB10><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Solid Neoplasm><Solid Tumor><Specialist><Specificity><Subcellular Process><System><T cell growth factor><T cells for CAR><T-Cell Activation><T-Cell Growth Factor><T-Cell Stimulating Factor><T-Cells><T-Lymphocyte><T3 Antigens><T3 Complex><T3 molecule><T44><Technology><Testing><Therapeutic><Thymocyte Stimulating Factor><Time><Translating><Tumor Burden><Tumor Load><Viral><Viral Vector><Xenograft Model><activate T cells><biocompatibility><biological material><biological signal transduction><biomaterial compatibility><biomaterial scaffold><bioscaffold><blood cancer><cancer of blood><cancer of the blood><cell biology><cell mediated therapies><cell transduction><cell-based therapeutic><cell-based therapy><cellular differentiation><cellular reprogramming><cellular therapeutic><cellular therapy><cellular transduction><chimeric antigen T cell receptor><chimeric antigen receptor><chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy><chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells><chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy><chimeric antigen receptor T cells><chimeric antigen receptor T therapy><chimeric antigen receptor fusion protein T-cells><chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells><clinical relevance><clinically relevant><confocal imaging><cost><crosslink><cytokine><density><design><designing><gIP-10><graft versus host disease><graft vs host disease><graft vs. host disease><immunogenicity><implantation><improved><in vivo><killer T cell><lymph cell><manufacture><manufacturing facility><manufacturing plants><manufacturing process><mechanical properties><multidisciplinary><pre-clinical efficacy><preclinical efficacy><prevent><preventing><procedural costs><procedure cost><production plants><programs><recruit><response><scaffold><scaffolding><success><three dimensional><thymus derived lymphocyte><transduced cells><transduction efficiency><translational opportunities><translational potential><tumor><xenograft transplant model><xenotransplant model>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Cancer; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Immunotherapy
A Pilot Clinical Study for a Novel Bioresorbable Bone Adhesive to Evidence Improved Cranial Flap Fixation Based on Radiographic Imaging and Patient Reported Outcomes,A Pilot Clinical Study for a Novel Bioresorbable Bone Adhesive to Evidence Improved Cranial Flap Fixation Based on Radiographic Imaging and Patient Reported Outcomes,"Project Abstract
In 2018 approximately 210,000 people in the U.S. underwent a craniotomy requiring cranial flap closure. The
instruments used to cut into the skull leave a continuous gap (“kerf line”) between the bone flap and the
surrounding skull. While cranial flap closure is relatively routine using plates and screws to fixate the flap, the
industry has lacked any real innovation to improve the status quo in patient care. Clinical results are still plagued
by many patients that spontaneously return with a loose or migrating plate, a devastating CSF leak or even
infection that often requires surgical intervention. Not to mention, plates and screws cause artifacts that interfere
with follow-up imaging (MRI or CT). Finally, plates and screws don't address the gaps left behind by the kerf line;
therefore, bone healing does not fully complete across this space. As a result, patients often complain of pain
and can feel the plates and screws through scalp and see depressions where the skin sinks—certainly this
effects their self-esteem. While flap fixation can be augmented with existing bone cements to address some of
these problems, they are not ubiquitously used because they lack desired handling properties and/or they
significantly increase the cost of the cranial closure.
RevBio’s bone adhesive biomaterial called Tetranite® (TN) could solve these issues. To accomplish this, the
bone adhesive material is injected into the kerf line, forming a robust fixation bond between the bone flap and
the surrounding skull and forming a water-tight seal upon setting. Overtime, the material serves as a scaffold as
it is gradually resorbed and replaced with bone. Thus, the material serves many functions as a fixation device, a
sealant, and a fusion device. Therefore, the goal for this project will be to advance the product from pre-clinical
development into humans and be the first truly efficacious option for replacing hardware (e.g., plates/screws,
clips) as a flap fixation methodology. The adhesive system has been fully developed, verified in a published
pivotal animal study, and validated in user handling cadaver trials; therefore, the next stage in the project
supported by the proposed grant application would accomplish the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Produce and
Test a Clinical-Grade Batch of TN for the Pilot Human Study, Aim 2A: Enroll Patients in Pilot Study and
Demonstrate Feasibility of Intra-operatively Fixating Flaps with TN as a Stand-Alone Device, and Aim 2B:
Patients Successfully Reach Primary and Secondary Endpoints at 6 and 12 Months Evidencing Safe Use
and Probable Benefit to Advance to a Larger or Expanded Clinical Study.
The proposed human pilot clinical study will demonstrate TN’s ability to fixate cranial flaps as a stand-alone and
replacement to hardware fixation for the first time in humans and will substantiate those flaps restored using TN

Integrated Engineering and Rehabilitation Training,Integrated Engineering and Rehabilitation Training,"This proposal describes our “Integrated Neural Engineering and Rehabilitation Training” program that
produces biomedical engineering Ph.D. graduates who combine state-of-the-art expertise in neural engineering
(an area of bioengineering) with a genuine appreciation of the practice and challenges of clinical rehabilitation.
This T32 is centered in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University, but also
includes the strong participation of several of our local medical centers. Our T32 is focused exclusively on
predoctoral training - having trained 59 students since 1999. We are requesting funding for 8 predoctoral
positions per year for five years, and have institutional commitment to match with two additional students. We
expect to train a total of ~20 BME Ph.D. students for two years each over the proposed 5 years. Trainees enter
with undergraduate training in engineering or a closely related discipline. They satisfy the rigorous requirements
of the BME Ph.D. program and benefit from its existing features, while our T32 program adds value through
highly collaborative and interdisciplinary research projects, a clinical immersion experience, and unique access
to visiting seminar speakers. Over the next 5 years, we will create and pilot a virtual reality-based Neural Anatomy
course (exploiting our unique relationship with the Microsoft HoloLens program), include formal diversity training,
and implement our newly formed external Advisory Committee comprised of academic leaders in rehabilitation
and neural engineering, representatives of large and small companies in the stimulation and rehabilitation
commercial space, practicing neural/rehabilitation physicians, and a student diversity professional.
 The specific objectives of our training program are: (1) Prepare our trainees for productive careers in
rehabilitation and neural engineering; (2) Provide a rigorous engineering education that forms the basis for future
innovation; (3) Provide specific expertise in the development and application of neural stimulation and
interventions for overcoming neurological disorders; (4) Provide specific expertise in modeling and simulation;
(5) Provide an extensive, hands-on clinical immersion experience that prepares each trainee for a translational
career; (6) Provide specific expertise in the deployment and integration of Brain Computer Interfaces; and (7)
Provide real-world professional development training to enhance post-graduation success.
 We have assembled a distinguished group of mentors who serve in one of three roles: Research Training
mentors (17) who are the primary research advisors of the trainees, Associate Research Training Mentors (5)
who are content experts on T32 trainee committees, and Clinical Training Mentors (12) from rehabilitation and
surgical disciplines who insure the clinical relevance of each trainee research project. Trainee project topics
include electrode development; stimulation pattern design; neural motor control mechanisms; neural
biomaterials, protection, and repair; deployment of interventions to individuals with neurological disorders;
neurorehabilitation; modeling and simulation; and brain-computer interfacing.",<Engineering><Medical Rehabilitation><Rehabilitation><Rehabilitation therapy><Training><rehab therapy><rehabilitative><rehabilitative therapy>,Bioengineering; Physical Rehabilitation; Rehabilitation
Leveraging immune-fibroblast interactions for biomaterial induced skin regeneration,Leveraging immune-fibroblast interactions for biomaterial induced skin regeneration,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Regeneration of native skin elements – hair follicles, sweat glands and adipose tissue, is a highly thought
after outcome of wound healing. While, in principle, very large skin wounds in adult mice can spontaneously
regenerate new hair follicles and new adipocytes, commonly studied small wounds in mice and clinical wounds
in humans heal with a far less desirable fibrotic scarring. If and how adult skin wounds can be directed to replace
the natural tendency for healing with a scar with regeneration of native skin elements remains unknown.
 This application is inspired by a serendipitous discovery that adding an antigen to our novel biomaterial, the
Microporous Annealed Particle (MAP) hydrogel, can induce regeneration of new hair follicles when added into
normally fibrotic small mouse skin wounds. This immunomodulatory MAP gel provides wound-resident immune
cells with the molecular triggers that elicit an adaptive immune response to enhance macrophage responses.
Further, our studies on naturally regenerating very large skin wound model show that macrophage-fibroblast
interactions are essential for stimulating new hair follicle regeneration.
 Through an integrated bioengineering, bioinformatic and experimental approach, this application will
focus on testing our new hypothesis that by engineering MAP gels to have specific immune triggers, interactions
between T-cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts in the wound can transform normally profibrotic healing response
into highly desirable regenerative response. The first aim of the proposed research is to mechanistically establish
the lymphocyte and macrophage subsets and the molecular signaling pathways required for MAP formulations
we have created to elicit hair follicle regeneration. This will be achieved using bioinformatic analyses of
transcriptomics, proteomic, and functional profiling at single-cell resolution. confirmed with in vivo loss of function/
transgenic mouse studies lacking key immune pathways or cells MAP gels. The second aim is to engineer new
types of immunomodulatory MAP gels designed to maximally induce T-cells and macrophage pro-regenerative
signals while minimizing pro-fibrotic signals using a high-throughput in vitro assay. The third aim is to determine
how MAP gel-induced immune signals enhance lineage plasticity of wound fibroblasts that is prerequisite for
new hair regeneration. This will be achieved via an advanced bioinformatic analysis on single-cell transcriptomic
data and functional gain- and loss-of-function studies on wound immune cells and fibroblasts.
 The study premise is based on newly accepted-for-publication and extensive preliminary data. The proposed
studies are significant because they will establish new immune cell-driven mechanism for enhancing fibroblast
plasticity and activating embryonic-like regeneration of native skin elements in adult wounds. The proposed
studies are innovative because they will establish new types of immune-modulating biomaterials, and new
paradigm of biomaterial-triggered regenerative response in adult tissues. In the future, the results of this study
will drive the development of next-generation immune-modulating wound biomaterials for potential clinical use.",<21+ years old><Adipocytes><Adipose Cell><Adipose tissue><Adult><Adult Human><Animals><Antigens><Back><Bio-Informatics><Biocompatible Materials><Bioinformatics><Biology><Biomaterials><Biomedical Engineering><Body Tissues><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cells><Cicatrix><Clinical><Data><Deposit><Deposition><Development><Dorsum><ECM><Elements><Embryo><Embryonic><Engineering><Extracellular Matrix><Fat Cells><Fatty Tissue><Fibroblasts><Fibrosis><Flow Cytofluorometries><Flow Cytofluorometry><Flow Cytometry><Flow Microfluorimetry><Flow Microfluorometry><Foreign Bodies><Foreign-Body Reaction><Formulation><Future><Gel><Gene Expression><Generalized Growth><Genetic><Grant><Growth><Growth Agents><Growth Factor><Growth Substances><Hair><Hair Follicle><Hair follicle structure><Histology><Human><Hydrogels><Immune><Immune signaling><Immunes><Immunology><Immunomodulation><Inflammatory Response><Integrin Binding><Interleukins><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Knowledge><Ligands><Lipocytes><Lymphatic cell><Lymphocyte><Lymphocytic><Macrophage><Mammalia><Mammals><Mature Lipocyte><Mature fat cell><Mesenchymal><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Molecular><Murine><Mus><Mφ><Natural regeneration><Outcome><Pathway interactions><Peptides><Population><Porosity><Prevention><Profibrotic factor><Profibrotic signal><Progenitor Cells><Property><Proteins Growth Factors><Proteomics><Publications><Receptor Gene><Regeneration><Regenerative response><Regenerative wound healing><Research><Resolution><Role><Scars><Science><Scientific Publication><Series><Signal Pathway><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Skin><Skin tissue regeneration><Speed><Sweat Glands><T-Cells><T-Lymphocyte><Testing><Tissue Growth><Tissues><Transgenic Mice><Translating><Wound Repair><Wound models><adaptive immune response><adaptive immunity><adipose><adulthood><bio-engineered><bio-engineers><bioengineering><biological engineering><biological material><biological signal transduction><crosslink><cutaneous wound><dermal wound><dermis regeneration><design><designing><developmental><enantiomer><epidermal regeneration><flow cytophotometry><functional gain><gain of function><gene regulatory network><hair regeneration><healing><immune modulation><immune regulation><immunogen><immunologic reactivity control><immunomodulatory><immunoregulation><immunoregulatory><improved><in vitro Assay><in vivo><in vivo Model><innovate><innovation><innovative><integrin bound><loss of function><lymph cell><network models><new approaches><next generation><non-genetic><nongenetic><novel><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><ontogeny><overexpress><overexpression><particle><pathway><phenotypic biomarker><phenotypic marker><regenerate><regenerate skin><regeneration healing><regeneration response><regenerative><regenerative approach><regenerative healing><regenerative strategy><regenerative technique><repair><repaired><resolutions><response><scRNA-seq><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single-cell RNA sequencing><skin regeneration><skin wound><small molecular inhibitor><small molecule inhibitor><social role><stem cells><sudiferous gland><thymus derived lymphocyte><tissue repair><tissue wound><transcriptomics><treat wound><white adipose tissue><wound><wound closure><wound healing><wound healing models><wound management><wound recovery><wound resolution><wound therapeutics><wound therapy><wound treatment><wounding><wounds><yellow adipose tissue>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Regenerative Medicine; Wound Healing and Care
Biomaterial technologies for interrogating sex differences in tissue repair and homeostasis,Biomaterial technologies for interrogating sex differences in tissue repair and homeostasis,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An individuals’ biological sex significantly affects their ability to repair and regenerate tissue. A clear example of
this is the reduced ability for women to heal and regenerate new, healthy tissue after menopause, which results
from a significant loss of sex hormone signaling. This reduction in hormone levels disproportionately enhances
the risk for many degenerative diseases including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease, and
degenerative brain diseases in which the rate of tissue breakdown exceeds the rate of tissue repair. While it is
known that several factors contribute to sex differences in tissue repair including biomechanics, nutrition,
physical activity level and sex hormones, the interplay between these parameters is not well understood.
Specifically, it is unknown how the native sex differences in tissue structure and the resulting differences in
mechanical function dictate cell phenotype and behavior and how this effect interacts with estrogen signaling to
overall control tissue repair. Thus, a fundamental, mechanistic understanding of how a cell responds to the
spatial and mechanical cues of its environment while mediating estrogen signaling is critical to understand why
sex differences occur in tissue repair and homeostasis and for future patient-centered repair and regeneration
strategies. The overall goal of our research program aims to develop biomaterial tools to interrogate sex
differences in tissue repair and homeostasis. Theme 1: Do male and female MSCs respond to spatial and
mechanical properties of the cell microenvironment differently? There is evidence in many tissues that
extracellular matrix structure, organization, and resulting function differs between age-matched males and
females. However, there are no studies showing how this affects cell response. Biomaterials engineered to mimic
both the fibrous properties of structural collagens and the viscoelastic properties of proteoglycans in the native
extracellular matrix will be used to assess sex differences in cell response to controlled changes in matrix
properties. Theme 2: How does estrogen presentation to the cell affect downstream transcription and behavior?
While estrogen is known to play a role on cell processes, these results are dependent on the concentration and
the temporal presentation of estrogen to the cell. To address this limitation, we will use concentration gradient
generator microchips to quickly and accurately determine the effect of estrogen concentration and timing on cell
transcriptional activity. Theme 3: Can we engineer biomaterial systems to control release and presentation of
estrogen to the cells? Release rates in a range of hours to months will be controlled by modulating diffusion out
of the biomaterials via material chemistry and architecture. The ability to control the rate of release and localize
to a specific tissue in the body is critical to promote the estrogen effects at the site while reducing the negative
and potentially deadly off-target effects. Results from these studies will provide future avenues of study to
understand how estrogen and the cell microenvironment drive sex differences in stem cell behavior which is
critical for tissue repair and homeostasis in both women and men.",<Address><Affect><Age><Architecture><Autoregulation><Behavior><Biocompatible Materials><Biomaterials><Biomechanics><Body Tissues><Brain Diseases><Brain Disorders><Cardiovascular Diseases><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Signaling><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Chemistry><Collagen><Degenerative Arthritis><Degenerative Disorder><Degenerative polyarthritis><Development><Differences between sexes><Differs between sexes><Diffusion><ECM><Encephalon Diseases><Endocrine Gland Secretion><Engineering><Engineering / Architecture><Environment><Estrogens><Extracellular Matrix><Female><Future><Gene Transcription><Genetic Transcription><Goals><Gonadal Steroid Hormones><Homeostasis><Hormones><Hour><Individual><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Intracranial CNS Disorders><Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders><Mechanics><Mediating><Natural regeneration><Osteoarthritis><Osteoarthrosis><Osteoporosis><Patients><Phenotype><Physical activity><Physiological Homeostasis><Post-Menopause><Post-menopausal Period><Postmenopausal Period><Postmenopause><Progenitor Cells><Property><Proteoglycan><RNA Expression><Regeneration><Research><Risk><Role><Sex Differences><Sex Hormones><Sex Steroid Hormones><Sexual differences><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Site><Structure><Subcellular Process><System><Technology><Therapeutic Estrogen><Therapeutic Hormone><Tissues><Transcription><Woman><Work><after menopause><ages><biological material><biological sex><biological signal transduction><biomechanical><cardiovascular disorder><cell behavior><cellular behavior><computer chip><customized therapy><customized treatment><degenerative condition><degenerative disease><degenerative joint disease><design><designing><developmental><diffused><diffuses><diffusing><diffusions><following menopause><gonadal steroids><healing><hormonal signals><hormone signals><hypertrophic arthritis><individualized medicine><individualized patient treatment><individualized therapeutic strategy><individualized therapy><individualized treatment><male><mechanic><mechanical><mechanical cue><mechanical properties><mechanical signal><men><mesenchymal stromal cell><microchip><nutrition><osteoarthritic><past menopause><patient centered><patient oriented><patient specific therapies><patient specific treatment><post-menopausal><postmenopausal><postmenopausal status><programs><regenerate><regenerate new tissue><regenerate tissue><regenerating damaged tissue><regenerating tissue><repair><repaired><response><sex><sex based differences><sex steroid><sex-dependent differences><sex-related differences><sex-specific differences><social role><stem cells><tailored medical treatment><tailored therapy><tailored treatment><tissue regeneration><tissue regrowth><tissue renewal><tissue repair><tissue specific regeneration><tool><unique treatment><viscoelasticity>,Aging; Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Estrogen; Regenerative Medicine; Women's Health Research
Development and Translation of Granulated Human-Derived Biomaterials for Integrative Cartilage Repair,Development and Translation of Granulated Human-Derived Biomaterials for Integrative Cartilage Repair,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The objective of this proposal is to study how a new human-derived biomaterial with granulated structure,
NatruLage, stimulates adult stem cell differentiation for integrative cartilage repair. Recent advances in the
treatment of articular cartilage and bone injuries have shown exciting potential to address matrix degeneration
associated with osteoarthritis (OA), a joint disease afflicting millions of people in the United States. New
candidate therapies utilize animal- or human-sourced materials to formulate unique microenvironments
favorable to stem cell responses that promote healing and integration. In healthy osteochondral tissue, the
extracellular matrix is organized into interstitial and pericellular domains with specialized cells and signaling
molecules. Together, these components define tissue-specific and structure-function relationships which are
lost during disease progression. Unfortunately, integrative cartilage repair still remains as a major medical
need, and new products are required for enhanced and improved therapies. Successful adoption of
osteochondral tissue therapies requires extensive technical and manufacturing de-risking to meet stringent
regulatory approval requirements. New innovations must meet current good manufacturing practice (cGMP)
specifications and demonstrate pre-clinical evidence of positive cellular and biological responses as well as
lack of toxicity prior to submission of an investigational device exemption (IDE) package and, later, execution
of a clinical trial. To improve integrative cartilage repair, we developed a novel granulated extracellular matrix
with a proprietary crosslinking technology, termed NatruLage, that is injected into the defect in bone and
cartilage layers to form osteochondral tissue that closely mimics the natural zonal tissue structure. Our device
is ‘flowable’ to deliver densely-packed tissue particles, and enable forming and shaping after delivery through
unique crosslinking via thiol-functionalized macromolecules. We have evaluated the same NatruLage
technology, using porcine instead of human tissue, and found promising regeneration and integration in a 12-
month large animal (goat) study of osteochondral repair. We are now focused on the development of
NatruLage using human-derived allograft tissue for delivery of distinct layers of osteochondral tissue. We will
define the appropriate chemistry, manufacturing, and quality controls to support the cGMP production of
NatruLage for future clinical trials, and we will contribute to understanding the stem cell responses to
NatruLage. We will pursue three related specific aims. In Aim 1, we will adapt established cGMP facilities for
production of human NatruLage. In Aim 2, we will define specifications for NatruLage reproducibility and donor
variability. In Aim 3, we will quantify NatruLage stimulation of adult stem cell proliferation and differentiation. If
successful, we will create an ideal secondary osteochondral repair market for otherwise discarded or nonviable
allograft tissue, and the grant will support the submission of an IDE package for NatruLage.",<Address><Adhesions><Adoption><Allografting><Animals><Assay><BUdR><Bioassay><Biocompatible Materials><Biological><Biological Agent><Biological Assay><Biological Products><Biomaterials><Body Tissues><Bone Injury><BrdU><Bromodeoxyuridine><Bromouracil Deoxyriboside><Broxuridine><Caprine Species><Cartilage><Cartilage injury><Cartilaginous Tissue><Cell Body><Cell Count><Cell Differentiation><Cell Differentiation process><Cell Growth in Number><Cell Locomotion><Cell Migration><Cell Movement><Cell Multiplication><Cell Number><Cell Proliferation><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cells><Cellular Migration><Cellular Motility><Cellular Proliferation><Chemistry><Clinical Trials><Colorado><Community Medicine><Defect><Degenerative Arthritis><Degenerative polyarthritis><Development><Devices><Disease Progression><ECM><Embryo><Embryonic><Ensure><Equipment><Extracellular Matrix><Family suidae><Formulation><Friction><Future><Gene set enrichment analysis><Genes><Goat><Goats Mammals><Good Manufacturing Process><Good manufacturing practice><Grant><Guidelines><Health><Human><Human Resources><Hyaluronic Acid><Implant><Individual><Joint Diseases><Lubrication><Manpower><Marketing><Measures><Mechanics><Medical><Mercaptans><Mercapto Compounds><Mesenchymal Progenitor Cell><Mesenchymal Stem Cells><Mesenchymal progenitor><Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells><Modern Man><Muscle><Muscle Tissue><Musculoskeletal><Natural regeneration><Ontology><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Osteoarthritis><Osteoarthrosis><Particle Size><Pathway interactions><Persons><Phenotype><Pigs><Position><Positioning Attribute><Process><Production><Progenitor Cells><Property><Quality Control><RNA Seq><RNA sequencing><RNAseq><Records><Regeneration><Regenerative Medicine><Reporting><Reproducibility><Research><Shapes><Signaling Molecule><Skin><Source><Specific qualifier value><Specified><Standardization><Structure><Structure-Activity Relationship><Suidae><Sulfhydryl Compounds><Surface><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><Swine><Technology><Temperature><Testing><Thiols><Tissue Therapy><Tissues><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Translations><United States><Validation><Work><adult progenitor><adult stem cell><arthropathic><arthropathies><arthropathy><articular cartilage><biologic><biological material><biologics><biopharmaceutical><biotherapeutic agent><bone><cartilage repair><cell motility><cellular differentiation><chemical structure function><commercialization><crosslink><degenerative joint disease><density><developmental><differential expression><differentially expressed><fetal><healing><human adult stem cell><human progenitor><human stem cells><human tissue><hypertrophic arthritis><improved><innovate><innovation><innovative><interstitial><joint disorder><macromolecule><manufacture><mechanic><mechanical><mechanical properties><mesenchymal stromal progenitor cells><mesenchymal-derived stem cells><muscular><novel><osteoarthritic><osteochondral><osteochondral repair><osteochondral tissue><particle><pathway><personnel><porcine><pre-clinical><preclinical><progenitor cell differentiation><progenitor cell proliferation><progenitor differentiation><progenitor proliferation><regenerate><repair strategy><response><somatic progenitor><somatic stem cell><stem and progenitor cell proliferation><stem and progenitor differentiation><stem cell differentiation><stem cell proliferation><stem cells><structure function relationship><suid><sulfhydryl group><surgery><technology platform><technology system><transcriptional differences><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing><translation><validations>,Arthritis; Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Osteoarthritis; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - Human; Transplantation

Natural Electrospun Scaffolds as an Alternative to Synthetic Mesh for Stress Urinary Incontinence,Natural Electrospun Scaffolds as an Alternative to Synthetic Mesh for Stress Urinary Incontinence,"ABSTRACT
Over 25% of adult women experience pelvic floor disorders including stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Stress
urinary incontinence is characterized by involuntary urination when pressure is exerted on the bladder, such as
coughing, sneezing, laughing, jogging and other forms of physical exercises. Incontinence can have a significant
impact on a woman’s quality of life and while there are non-surgical interventions such as pelvic floor exercises
and pessaries, the failure rate is up to 50%. Many women for which non-surgical interventions have been
inadequate, resort to surgical solutions such as midurethral sling placement. Of the 300,000 patients who receive
midurethral sling surgeries in the US every year, 2-3% experience mesh erosion and up to 20% remain
incontinent which may require revision surgeries where more synthetic mesh is placed, compounding the
problem. The primary objective of this Phase I STTR is to establish feasibility of a natural, coaxial electrospun
scaffold to be used as an alternative to synthetic surgical mesh. Our team is developing a naturally derived
scaffold that will dissolve over time and replace the support of the urethra with healthy formation of scar tissue.
The Phase I project will focus on the fabrication of coaxial scaffolds using silk fibroin and polyhydroxybutyrate
and the attachment and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) of fibroblasts to those scaffolds compared to
state-of-the-art polypropylene. The deposition of ECM of fibroblasts onto the scaffold demonstrates feasibility of
the scaffold to promote fibrous growth as the scaffold degrades over time. If our device is successful, we will
decrease the complications and need for revision surgeries for thousands of women undergoing midurethral
sling placements. We hypothesize that a coaxial scaffold with the combination of silk fibroin surrounding a PHB
core will provide increased mechanical properties and cell attachment points. In Specific Aim 1, we will develop
a tunable protocol to fabricate coaxial scaffolds of different weight percentages. In Specific Aim 2, we will validate
that our coaxial scaffolds are mechanically strong enough to support the urethra by comparing to the properties
defined by Lei et al. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will compare ECM deposition and proliferation of fibroblasts
on the coaxially spun scaffolds to the synthetic polypropylene mesh. If all criterion are met and feasibility is
developed, our device has the potential to move women’s health to a more biocompatible and effective
alternative for stress urinary incontinence.",<Adult females><Adult women><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Autologous><Biocompatible Materials><Biological Mimetics><Biomaterials><Biomimetics><Biopolymers><Bladder><Bladder Urinary System><Bleeding><Blood Vessels><Body Tissues><Cell Adhesion><Cell Attachment><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cell-Matrix Adhesions><Cell-Matrix Junction><Cellular Adhesion><Cellular Expansion><Cellular Growth><Cicatrix><Collaborations><Collagen><Coughing><Deposit><Deposition><Devices><ECM><Electrospinning><Exercise><Extracellular Matrix><Extracellular Matrix Proteins><Extravasation><Failure><Female Health><Females in adulthood><Fiber><Fibroblasts><Fibroins><Friction><Future><Generalized Growth><Generations><Goals><Growth><Hemorrhage><In Vitro><Incontinence><Incontinence when straining><Infection><Infiltration><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Jogging><Leakage><Mechanics><Medical Device><Microbiology><Modulus><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Patients><Pelvic Floor><Pelvic Floor Disorders><Pelvic floor structure><Pessaries><Phase><Physiatric Procedure><Physical Exercise><Physical Medicine Procedure><Physical Therapeutics><Physical therapy><Physiotherapy><Polymers><Polypropylenes><Procedures><Proliferating><Propene Polymers><Property><Propylene Polymers><Protocol><Protocols documentation><QOL><Quality of life><Reconstructive Surgical Procedures><Reporting><Research><Resort><STTR><Scars><Second Look><Second Look Surgery><Silk><Small Business Technology Transfer Research><Sneezing><Spillage><Stress><Stress Incontinence><Stress Urinary Incontinence><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Mesh><Surgical Procedure><Surgical Revision><Technology><Tendon structure><Tendons><Testing><Time><Tissue Engineering><Tissue Growth><Tissues><Urethra><Urination><Urine><Vagina><Weight><Woman><Women in adulthood><Women's Health><Work><biocompatibility><bioengineered tissue><biological material><biomaterial compatibility><blood loss><cell growth><combat><copolymer><engineered tissue><experience><fabrication><healing><improved><in vivo><innovate><innovation><innovative><interventional strategy><irritation><manufacture><mechanic><mechanical><mechanical properties><micturition><model of animal><nanofiber><nanofibrous><ontogeny><patient centered><patient oriented><pelvic organ prolapse><polymer><polymeric><pressure><prevent><preventing><prototype><reconstruction surgery><reconstructive surgery><scaffold><scaffolding><side effect><sound><standard of care><success><surgery><tissue wound><translational applications><urethral><urinary bladder><vascular><weights><wound><wounding><wounds>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Nanotechnology; Urologic Diseases; Women's Health Research
Translational Research in Biomaterials,Translational Research in Biomaterials,"ABSTRACT
This application proposes the third renewal of Boston University's NIH training program, Translational Re-
search in Biomaterials (TRB). The TRB mission is to train PhD students as interdisciplinary and transla-
tional research scientists and engineers. The TRB trainees acquire a fundamental and quantitative under-
standing of materials, biomaterial-tissue responses, and molecular and cell biology, as well as interdiscipli-
nary training experiences and education that promote discussion and scientific inquiry in areas outside stu-
dents’ “comfort zones,” such as in business and clinical trials. New for this renewal are the following: a jun-
ior faculty mentoring plan, integrated student governance, better data collection, new courses, professional
development workshops, student founded and led translational MInT program, Fireside chats with key opin-
ion-leaders, peer mentoring program pairing first year trainees with senior trainees, and more targeted ef-
forts for underrepresented minority recruitment.
The cornerstones of the TRB program are the curriculum and the program elements that combine interdis-
ciplinary research, quantitative science, engineering, and translational-based courses in clinical trials and
business, with student-organized seminar club, dinners with clinicians, training in professional ethics, indi-
vidual development plans, and professional workshops/ career panels. Our aim is to teach the unique skills
and competencies that are essential to thrive in a multidisciplinary collaborative team striving to meet com-
mon goals in research, development, translation, and, ultimately, commercialization. Since our initial funding
in 2009, 44 students have participated in the TRB training program: 33 were supported with NIH funds and
11 were co-funded by the BU Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Chemistry. We have accom-
plished our demographic and training mission: 21 women (47%), 23 men (53%), 36% minority, 91% reten-
tion; 100% employment; 22 current students. The TRB trainees have excelled on multiple fronts, including
publications (112 published papers with 57 first-authored; five in review; five in preparation), patent applica-
tions (14), oral (56) and poster (177) conference presentations, competitive individual fellowships (19), and
other awards (27). TRB alumni hold positions ranging from Assistant Professor at Rice University, to a
postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard, to co-founding biomedical start-ups (e.g., Pharmachk). In this renewal,
the continuation of the TRB, with six trainee stipends per year funded via NIH (trainees are supported for
two years) is aligned with the expertise of participating faculty, the availability of a large and strong applicant
pool eligible for and interested in the TRB program (200+ training grant eligible applicants), and an extramu-
ral funding base to provide the appropriate research environment and continued support for NIH trainees
beyond their first two years.",<Biocompatible Materials><Biomaterials><Translational Research><Translational Science><biological material><translation research><translational investigation>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology
Understanding and using microbial conductive nanowires,Understanding and using microbial conductive nanowires,"Abstract
Long-range (>10 μm) transport of electrons along networks of G. sulfurreducens protein filaments, known as
microbial nanowires, has been invoked to explain a wide range of globally important redox phenomena. The
remarkable electronic conduction capability of those nanowires has sparked a great deal of interest in the medical
application space, such as for building biocompatible materials and biosensor. For more than a decade, G.
sulfurreducens nanowires were thought to be bacterial type IV pili, supported by many indirect genetic and
biochemical observations. Recently we showed that these conductive nanowires are not made of type IV pilins.
Instead, these structures are a polymerized multi-heme c-type cytochrome, OmcS, which have never been
characterized before. The OmcS filament model is consistent with the known roles of OmcS in Geobacter
respiration, but our knowledge of cytochrome appendages is still very limited. This study aims at addressing
fundamental scientific questions about cytochrome filaments in respiring prokaryotes as well as applying our
discoveries into the general medical field. Specifically, I will: A) identify and characterize novel cytochrome
filaments in bacterial and archaeal strains, through bioinformatics algorithms followed by microscopic validation.
B) Then I will study the conduction mechanism of these filaments by high resolution cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) and conductivity measurement. C) Finally, based on these new insights into cytochrome
filaments, I will create a novel design for a self-assembled conductive nanowire. These nanowires may be
derived directly from a novel cytochrome filament or may contain a peptide/protein based self-assembled scaffold
core with soluble cytochromes appended to the outer surface. The results will advance our understanding of
cytochrome nanowires, as well as generating self-assembling nanowire scaffolds that may be used in many
future biomedical applications.",<Address><Algorithms><Amaze><Antibodies><Archaea><Archaebacteria><Archaeobacteria><Archaeon><Bacteria><Bio-Informatics><Biochemical><Biocompatible Materials><Bioinformatics><Biomaterials><Biophysical Process><Biosensor><Cell Body><Cells><Collaborations><Cryo-electron Microscopy><Cryoelectron Microscopy><Cytochrome c Group><Cytochromes><Cytochromes Type c><Data><Electron Cryomicroscopy><Electron Transport><Electronics><Electrons><Ferroprotoporphyrin><Fiber><Filament><Fimbriae Proteins><Future><Generalized Growth><Genetic><Geobacter><Growth><H element><Heme><Hydrogen><Knowledge><Label><Lead><Measurement><Measures><Medical><Mentors><Messenger RNA><Microbe><Microscopic><Modeling><Molecular><Morphology><Negative Beta Particle><Negatrons><Organism><Oxidants><Oxidation-Reduction><Oxidizing Agents><Pb element><Peptides><Pili Structural Proteins><Pilin><Pilum><Point Mutation><Polymers><Prokaryotae><Prokaryotic Cells><Proteins><Proteomics><Protoheme><Pyrobaculum><Recombinants><Redox><Resolution><Respiration><Role><Scaffolding Protein><Source><Structure><Surface><Techniques><Tissue Growth><Validation><Work><appendage><biological material><biological sensor><biophysical approaches><biophysical characteristics><biophysical characterization><biophysical measurement><biophysical mechanism><biophysical methodology><biophysical methods><biophysical parameters><biophysical properties><biophysical techniques><cryo-EM><cryoEM><cryogenic electron microscopy><design><designing><electron acceptor><electron transfer><electronic><electronic device><extracellular><ferroheme><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><heme C><imaging approach><imaging based approach><insight><interest><living system><mRNA><microbial><monomer><mutant><nano filament><nanofilament><nanowire><novel><ontogeny><oxidation reduction reaction><pilus><polymer><polymeric><prokaryote><rational design><resolutions><respiratory mechanism><scaffold><scaffolding><self assembly><social role><synthetic biology><validations>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Nanotechnology
"Bone marrow niche regulation of disseminated tumor cell dormancy, reactivation, and metastasis.","Bone marrow niche regulation of disseminated tumor cell dormancy, reactivation, and metastasis.","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Metastatic relapse may occur in patients with ER+ breast cancer decades after original diagnosis. Most breast
cancer related deaths are caused by metastasis and thus identifying at-risk patients and developing therapies to
prevent reactivation are a crucial challenge. These efforts have been impeded by a lack of understanding of
cancer cell dormancy in the bone marrow, believed to be the cellular source of metastatic relapse. It is not well
understood how tumor cells interact with the bone marrow microenvironment and how these interactions regulate
tumor cell dormancy and escape. My proposed research seeks to develop a mouse model of dormancy and
investigate the spatial organization of the bone marrow niche in patient samples in the mentored K99 phase and
develop a biomaterial model of dormancy in the independent R00 phase. I hypothesize (i) cancer stem cells are
a subset of disseminated tumor cells responsible for metastatic relapse and (ii) the bone marrow niche, including
the healthy stem cell niche, facilitates dormancy and reactivation of these cells. In Aim 1, I will develop a novel
mouse model of hormone responsive breast cancer dormancy in bone marrow and evaluate the presence,
phenotype, and microenvironmental regulation of disseminated tumor cells using optical tissue clearing/3D
imaging of whole bone. In Aim 2, I will investigate the hypothesis that tumor cell interactions with the bone marrow
niche control tumor cell phenotype via high dimensional spatial analysis of bone marrow biopsies from patients
with breast cancer including imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and spatial single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq).
In Aim 3, I will develop a biomaterial model of the dormant bone marrow niche via creating mechanical mimics
of the three distinct compartments of bone marrow and evaluate the role of mechanosensing in induction and
maintenance of dormancy. In the K99 phase of the award, Prof Max Wicha will serve as my main mentor. Dr.
Wicha is a pioneer in the cancer stem cell field and is an expert in breast cancer biology and metastasis. I will
work with and consult my collaborators and mentoring team, including Prof Fei Wen (imaging mass cytometry),
Evan Keller (single cell spatial analysis program), Dr. Dafydd Thomas (pathology core), Prof Gary Luker
(microscopy), Prof Monika Burness (breast cancer clinical oncology) and Prof Sofia Merjaver (breast cancer
molecular biology). My K99 training will consist of developing a novel mouse model of bone marrow dormancy
and learning bioinformatics approaches to analyze spatial contributions to cellular phenotype in IMC and
scRNAseq data to propel me toward developing a synthetic dormant bone marrow niche mimic using
biomaterials during the independent R00 phase. In sum, the proposed research will address an urgent, unmet
need to identify the role of the bone marrow niche in breast cancer dormancy and reactivation, which may provide
a path forward for identifying patients at higher risk of metastasis and developing therapies against reactivation.",<3-D Imaging><3D imaging><Antibodies><Assay><Award><Bio-Informatics><Bioassay><Biocompatible Materials><Bioinformatics><Biological Assay><Biomaterials><Biopsy><Biopsy Sample><Biopsy Specimen><Blood Vessels><Body Tissues><Bone Marrow><Bone Marrow Blood-Deriving Cell><Bone Marrow Blood-Forming Cell><Bone Marrow Cells><Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System><Bone Marrow Stem Cell><Bone marrow biopsy><Breast Cancer><Breast Cancer Cell><Breast Cancer Model><Breast Cancer Patient><Breast Tumor Patient><Breast tumor model><Cancer Biology><Cause of Death><Cell Body><Cell Communication><Cell Interaction><Cell Line><Cell-to-Cell Interaction><CellLine><Cells><Cellular Mechanotransduction><Classification><Clinical><Clinical Oncology><Co-culture><Cocultivation><Coculture><Coculture Techniques><Consult><Cues><Cytometry><DNA Molecular Biology><Data><Development><Diagnosis><ER Positive><ER+><Elements><Endocrine Gland Secretion><Estrogen receptor positive><Evaluation><Exhibits><Gel><General Prognostic Factor><Hematopoietic><Hormone Responsive><Hormones><Hydrogels><Image><Immune><Immunes><Immunocompetent><In Vitro><Inflammation><Learning><Life><Maintenance><Malignant Breast Neoplasm><Malignant Cell><Mechanical Signal Transduction><Mechanics><Mechanosensory Transduction><Mentors><Metastasis><Metastasize><Metastatic Lesion><Metastatic Mass><Metastatic Neoplasm><Metastatic Tumor><Mice><Mice Mammals><Microscopy><Modeling><Molecular Biology><Murine><Mus><Nature><Neoplasm Metastasis><Normal Tissue><Normal tissue morphology><Optics><Paracrine Communication><Paracrine Signaling><Pathology><Patients><Phase><Phenotype><Play><Population><Prevention><Prognostic Factor><Prognostic/Survival Factor><Proliferating><Recurrence><Recurrent><Recurrent disease><Regulation><Regulatory Pathway><Relapse><Relapsed Disease><Research><Risk><Role><Sampling><Secondary Neoplasm><Secondary Tumor><Series><Source><Stem Cell like><Strains Cell Lines><Stressful Event><Systematics><Testing><Therapeutic Hormone><Three-Dimensional Imaging><Tissues><Training><Tumor Cell><Work><biological material><biomarker identification><bone><bone marrow stromal stem cell><breast tumor cell><cancer cell><cancer metastasis><cancer progenitor><cancer progenitor cells><cancer stem cell><computer based prediction><consults><cultured cell line><develop therapy><developmental><experience><hemopoietic><high dimensionality><high risk><human disease><identification of biomarkers><identification of new biomarkers><imaging><immune competent><in vivo><intervention development><malignant breast tumor><malignant progenitor><malignant stem cell><mammary cancer model><mammary tumor model><marker identification><mechanic><mechanical><mechanosensing><mechanotransduction><mouse model><murine model><neoplastic cell><novel><optical><predictive modeling><prevent><preventing><progenitor cell niche><progenitor niche><programs><protein biomarkers><protein markers><recruit><scRNA-seq><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single-cell RNA sequencing><social role><stem><stem and progenitor cell niche><stem cell characteristics><stem cell niche><stemness><stressful experience><stressful life event><stressful life experience><therapeutic agent development><therapeutic development><therapeutic target><therapy development><tissue progenitor><tissue stem cells><treatment development><tumor><tumor cell metastasis><vascular>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Breast Cancer; Cancer; Clinical Research; Prevention; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Human; Women's Health Research
Expanding the Functionality of Engineered Extracellular Matrices,Expanding the Functionality of Engineered Extracellular Matrices,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Although hydrogel-based materials constitute a multibillion-dollar market, commercial applications for drug
delivery and regenerative medicine are extremely limited. Hydrogels have garnered intense interest as
extracellular matrix (ECM) mimics due to their tailorable permeability, mechanics, and degradability, yet their
clinical use in this area largely depends on biological materials such as proteins. Although some success has
been met with naturally-derived ECM, these naturally derived materials are often limited by long regulatory
approval timelines due to the potential to react with other biologics. Synthetic materials are therefore attractive
due to their known chemical compositions, but the challenge with their use lies in the lack of complexity as
compared to biological systems, which translates to a lack of efficacy in the clinic. Hence, the goal of this
proposal, and of our research lab, is to expand the toolbox for building complexity and functionality into
synthetic hydrogel biomaterials by using dynamic chemistries and monomer sequence-based
strategies. This strategy takes much inspiration from nature, as the structure and function of biological polymers
arise from the precise placement of their amino acids or nucleotides. In addition, cells are able to remodel and
reconfigure the natural ECM over time. Both of these characteristics have proven difficult to engineer into
synthetic networks. Hence, our goals over the next five years are to 1) develop hydrogels with reversible
crosslinks to quantitatively design reconfigurable matrices, 2) develop synthetic sequence-controlled linkers to
control hydrogel properties (e.g., mechanics, degradation, activity) using polypeptoids, and 3) combine these
approaches to develop self-assembled constructs for tissue engineering. We believe our goals will be useful for
broad applications in regenerative medicine, therapeutic delivery, and preclinical models of tissue for drug
development. In addition, we anticipate that the potential to alter current modes of thinking in hydrogel and
biomaterial design is high, and that our work will shed insight to the biological processes underlying cell-matrix
interactions. For these reasons, this work is well suited for the R35 Maximizing Investigators' Research Award
for Early Stage Investigators.",<Amino Acids><Area><Award><Base Sequence><Biocompatible Materials><Biological Agent><Biological Function><Biological Process><Biological Products><Biomaterials><Breathing><Cell Body><Cell Culture Techniques><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cells><Characteristics><Chemicals><Chemistry><Clinic><Clinical><Drug Delivery><Drug Delivery Systems><ECM><Engineering><Extracellular Matrix><Goals><Hydrogels><Investigators><Marketing><Mechanics><Nature><Nucleotide Sequence><Nucleotides><Permeability><Polymers><Pre-Clinical Model><Preclinical Models><Property><Proteins><Reaction><Regenerative Medicine><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Respiratory Aspiration><Respiratory Inspiration><Structure><Therapeutic><Thinking><Time><Tissue Engineering><Tissue Model><Translating><Work><aminoacid><bioengineered tissue><biological material><biological systems><biologics><biopharmaceutical><biotherapeutic agent><cell culture><cell cultures><commercial application><crosslink><design><designing><drug development><engineered tissue><insight><inspiration><interest><mechanic><mechanical><monomer><nucleic acid sequence><polymer><polymeric><scaffold><scaffolding><self assembly><success><thoughts><timeline>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Regenerative Medicine
Engineering Biomaterials to Modulate the Bone Marrow Microenvironment in Multiple Myeloma,Engineering Biomaterials to Modulate the Bone Marrow Microenvironment in Multiple Myeloma,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Multiple myeloma (MM) accounts for ~23% of all hematologic malignancies with a 2.1% of cancer-related deaths
in the United States in 2022. Despite tremendous efforts to develop effective therapies, MM remains largely
incurable, and virtually all patients develop resistance to current therapies. Thus, there is an urgent clinical need
for innovative and improved MM therapeutics. It has been demonstrated that bone marrow endothelium is critical
to MM cell homing, progression, survival, and drug resistance. Specifically, cyclophilin A and E-selectin, a
homing factor and adhesion receptor, respectively, expressed by bone marrow endothelial cells, are critical to
MM survival. Thus, inhibition of cyclophilin A and E-selectin provides a potential therapeutic strategy to abolish
MM dissemination and resistance. However, direct- and specific-inhibition of cyclophilin A and E-selectin by
small molecules has been elusive. Thus, cyclophilin A and E-selectin are promising candidates for combination
RNA interference (RNAi) therapy, which inhibits traditionally undruggable targets by directly reducing their
messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. The challenge of utilizing small-interfering RNA (siRNA) is the need for
safe and effective delivery methods, as siRNA degrades in the bloodstream and does not readily cross
membranes. During my predoctoral studies, I have engineered a library of polymer-lipid hybrid biomaterials, that
in combination with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid conjugates and siRNA, assembled into nanoparticles (NPs)
via microfluidic mixing. Through high-throughput in vivo screening, I identified a NP formulation with potent gene
silencing in bone marrow endothelial cells in vivo. This formulation was used to encapsulate cyclophilin A siRNA,
and showed inhibition of MM progression in vivo, and sensitized MM cells to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib,
a current therapeutic modality to treat MM. During the F99 phase, I will improve our NP design by incorporating
bone marrow endothelial-targeting ligands on the NP’s surface to enhance their specificity to bone marrow
endothelium, minimizing off-target effects. I will use our targeted NP to co-encapsulate cyclophilin A and E-
selectin siRNA sequences, and evaluate their inhibition in vitro through adhesion and transendothelial migration
assays, to determine the invasive abilities of MM cells. Further, I will test our co-delivery siRNA nanotechnology
through a survival study in a validated mouse xenograft model of MM and quantify its effects either alone or in
combination with bortezomib. This technology is expected to provide with a broadly enabling platform to target
other bone marrow-homing cancers. For the K00 phase, I will identify a renowned cancer biology laboratory to
study cell-cell interactions in the bone marrow immune microenvironment utilizing high-dimensional single-cell
approaches and tissue-engineered models, with the aim to determine mechanisms that drive cancer progression
and drug resistance. Completion of this project will successfully prepare me to launch an NIH-funded research
laboratory that focuses on drug delivery targeting the tumor microenvironment as means of cancer therapy.",<3-D modeling><3D modeling><ATAC sequencing><ATAC-seq><ATACseq><Adhesions><Anti-Cancer

Idaho INBRE Program,Idaho INBRE Program,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This Idaho INBRE team science administrative supplement titled, “Establishing a developmentally inspired
biomaterial platform to direct stem cell tenogenesis” fits the Idaho INBRE-4 parent grant scientific theme of
Cell Signaling. Tendons are strong, collagenous musculoskeletal tissues that transfer mechanical forces from
muscle to bone. There is a clinical need for novel regenerative therapies to treat tendon injuries as healing is
limited and injuries are associated with long-term loss of function. Three interdisciplinary investigators will work
as a team to leverage their individual expertise to design a biomaterial polymer platform to control tenogenesis.
Our team includes experts in the areas of tendon development and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)
differentiation (Dr. Schiele – Biomedical Engineering), polymeric hydrogels and biomaterials (Dr. Bernards –
Chemical Engineering), and peptide synthesis and organic chemistry (Dr. Waynant – Chemistry). There is a
limited understanding of the biochemical and mechanical factors that regulate tenogenesis. Normal embryonic
and postnatal tendon development will inform our tenogenic strategy. By leveraging the strengths of the team,
we will advance a novel hydrogel platform and knowledge of tenogenic regulators. We will determine the
combination of developmentally identified biochemical and mechanical factors that regulate tenogenesis and
deliver those factors with a novel biomaterial platform. We hypothesize that developmental factors can be
rationally designed into a new class of zwitterionic cross-linked polyampholyte hydrogels to direct MSC into
functional tendon cells. The project has two specific aims. Specific Aim 1 develops our team and defines the
roles that peptides mimicking the developmentally identified cell-cell junction proteins (cadherin-11 and N-
cadherin) and extracellular matrix proteins (fibronection and collagen) have on the induction of stem cell
tenogenesis. These signals will be delivered from polyampholyte hydrogels synthesized with novel zwitterionic
cross-linkers, which are designed to control the presentation of the desired cell signaling peptides. Specific Aim
2 expands this family of zwitterionic cross-linkers to finetune the mechanical properties of the polyampholyte
hydrogels to match specific stages of tendon development. This will determine how the tissue elastic modulus
and biochemical signaling together control tenogenesis. To meet Idaho INBRE goals, this team science project
also provides opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to design and test this biomaterial
platform, which further enhances the pipeline of well-trained biomedical researchers. The combined results
from this team effort will be a family of tunable zwitterionic cross-linker species that are incorporated into
polyampholyte hydrogels designed to deliver biochemical and mechanical developmental factors that regulate
tenogenesis. We anticipate this will represent a significant breakthrough in modeling and understanding tendon
development to guide effective regeneration strategies. These results will be the preliminary data for a
collaborative NIH funding application.",<3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><Address><Adhesions><Administrative Supplement><Area><Binding Sites><Biochemical><Biocompatible Materials><Biomaterials><Biomedical Engineering><Biomedical Research><Body Tissues><Cell Adhesion><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Junctions><Cell Signaling><Cell-Cell Adhesion><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cells><Cellular Adhesion><Chemical Engineering><Chemicals><Chemistry><Clinical><Co(beta)-cyano-7''-(2-methyl)adeninylcobamide><Cold-Insoluble Globulins><Collaborations><Collagen><Combining Site><Complement><Complement Proteins><Crosslinker><Cues><Custom><Data><Development><ECM><Education><Educational aspects><Elastic Tissue><Elasticity><Embryo><Embryonic><Encapsulated><Engineering><Environment><Extracellular Matrix><Extracellular Matrix Proteins><FN1><Family><Fibronectin 1><Fibronectins><Funding><Generalized Growth><Goals><Growth><Growth Agents><Growth Factor><Growth Substances><Hydrogels><Idaho><In Vitro><Individual><Injury><Intercellular Junctions><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigators><Knowledge><LETS Proteins><Large External Transformation-Sensitive Protein><Link><Mechanics><Mesenchymal Progenitor Cell><Mesenchymal Stem Cells><Mesenchymal progenitor><Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modeling><Modulus><Murine><Mus><Muscle><Muscle Tissue><Musculoskeletal><N-Cadherin><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Natural regeneration><OB-cadherin><Opsonic Glycoprotein><Opsonic alpha(2)SB Glycoprotein><Organic Chemistry><Peptide Signal Sequences><Peptide Synthesis><Peptides><Performance><Permeability><Persons><Polymers><Production><Progenitor Cells><Proteins><Proteins Growth Factors><Reactive Site><Regeneration><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Role><Science><Series><Side><Signal Peptide><Signal Sequences><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Site><Students><Synthesis Chemistry><Synthetic Chemistry><System><Tendon Injuries><Tendon structure><Tendons><Testing><Tissue Growth><Tissues><Training><United States National Institutes of Health><Variant><Variation><Work><alpha 2-Surface Binding Glycoprotein><bio-engineered><bio-engineers><biocompatible polymer><bioengineering><biological engineering><biological material><biological signal transduction><bone><cadherin-11><complementation><crosslink><customs><density><design><designing><developmental><factor A><graduate student><healing><in vivo><injuries><loss of function><mechanic><mechanical><mechanical cue><mechanical force><mechanical properties><mechanical signal><mechanical stimulus><mesenchymal stromal progenitor cells><mesenchymal-derived stem cells><muscular><novel><ontogeny><osteoblast cadherin><parent grant><peptide aminoacid sequence><peptide mimetic><peptide mimic><peptide sequence><peptidomimetics><physical property><polymer><polymeric><postnatal><progenitor cell differentiation><progenitor differentiation><programs><protein aminoacid sequence><protein signal sequence><rational design><regenerate><regeneration based therapy><regeneration therapy><regenerative therapeutics><regenerative therapy><social role><stem and progenitor differentiation><stem cell differentiation><stem cells><tendon development><tendon growth><tendon maturation><theories><three dimensional><undergrad><undergraduate><undergraduate student>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Building Research Capacity at Institutions with Limited NIH Funding; Clinical Research; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human
Decoupling sex chromosome and sex hormone regulation of cardiac myofibroblast activation,Decoupling sex chromosome and sex hormone regulation of cardiac myofibroblast activation,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart failure is a result of aberrant matrix remodeling in the left ventricle; male patients experience ventricular
wall thinning, whereas females experience ventricular wall thickening. While current pharmacologic agents
palliate symptoms associated with heart failure, the morbidity of the disease remains high as these treatments
do not provide a universal cure, necessitating a sex-specific understanding of heart failure. Mechanical cues and
gonadal hormones regulate the sex-specific cardiac remodeling observed during heart failure through changes
in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Resident cardiac fibroblasts that reside in the ventricular wall largely regulate
aberrant ECM remodeling during heart failure, but the sex-specific regulation of cell-mediated ECM remodeling
remains poorly understood. Both sex hormones and sex chromosomes have been implicated in regulating sex
differences in cardiac ECM remodeling, but current methods do not decouple their synergistic effects. My
proposal seeks to decouple the effects of sex chromosomes and sex hormones using gonadectomized animal
models and biomaterials-based cell culture tools that recapitulate the cardiac ECM during fibrotic stiffening. Our
laboratory tools enable our central hypothesis: sex chromosome combination and gonadal hormones
synergistically regulate myofibroblast phenotypes, and X-chromosome linked genes and estrogen
dosage will promote myofibroblast matrix remodeling. The hypothesis will be investigated through the
following aims: Aim 1 will improve our understanding of myofibroblast populations that drive sex-specific matrix
remodeling independent of gonadal hormones; Aim 2 will use engineered hydrogels to mimic sex-specific
myofibroblast phenotypes in vitro; Aim 3 will investigate the role of estrogen and estrogen receptor expression
on mediating the myofibroblast phenotype independent of sex chromosome combination. By leveraging animal

Vertically Integrated Approach to Design a Biologically and Mechanically Optimized Vascular Conduit for Dialysis Vascular Access,Vertically Integrated Approach to Design a Biologically and Mechanically Optimized Vascular Conduit for Dialysis Vascular Access,"ABSTRACT
Dialysis vascular access (arteriovenous fistulae [AVF] and arteriovenous grafts [AVG]) is the Lifeline
for the 500,000+ patients on hemodialysis in the United States (3million+ worldwide). Unfortunately,
both AVFs and AVGs have high failure rates due to an aggressive venous segment stenosis which
results in multiple interventional procedures, hospitalizations, and increased catheter (CVC) use. This
results in vascular access also being the Achilles Heel of hemodialysis and an important unmet clinical
need which results in a very significant morbidity, mortality, and economic cost (over 5B USD per
annum).
In this proposal we will combine expertise and experience from both industry and academia to create
an innovative vascular conduit (the Functional INtegrated Electrospun [FINE] device) that comprises
an inner Cu-PAS core surrounded by an outer P4HB sheath that will have (a) a precisely controlled
microstructure to promote host cell integration (b) anti-bacterial and immunomodulatory properties (c)
vein-artery-matched geometry to minimize upstream injury pathways and (d) an intrinsic self-sealing
ability that allows for early cannulation.
At an operational level we plan to (a) selectively design, refine and prototype FINE devices (b)
document the safety and efficacy of selected FINE devices in a pig arteriovenous access stenosis
model and (c) develop clinical scale production capabilities for the FINE device.
In summary, this proposal brings together a trio of unlikely partners (industry x 1 and academia x 2)
that between them have the science, the infrastructure, the experience, and the people to bring
disruptive change to dialysis vascular access. While none of us on our own could have done what is
described in this proposal, we would also venture to say that the sum of the individual parts will in this
case be exponentially larger than the whole.",<3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><AV fistula><Academia><Anatomic Sites><Anatomic structures><Anatomy><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Animals><Anti-Bacterial Agents><Anti-Inflammatories><Anti-Inflammatory Agents><Anti-inflammatory><Area><Arteries><Arteriovenous Aneurysm><Arteriovenous fistula><Autologous><Bilateral><Biocompatible Materials><Biology><Biomaterials><Blood Vessels><Breathing><Cannulations><Catheters><Cell Body><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cells><Clinical><Contralateral><Copper><Cu element><Devices><Dialysis><Dialysis procedure><ECM><Elastomers><Engineering><Extracellular Matrix><Failure><Family suidae><Feedback><Friends><Genetic><Geometry><Goals><Groin><Hemodialyses><Hemodialysis><Histologic><Histologically><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Human><Hyperplasia><Hyperplastic><Immunomodulation><Individual><Industry><Infiltration><Infrastructure><Inguinal region><Injury><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Mechanics><Microscopic><Modeling><Modern Man><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><North Carolina><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Pathologic><Pathologic Constriction><Pathological Constriction><Pathway interactions><Patients><Performance><Persons><Pigs><Polymers><Procedures><Process><Production><Property><Resistance><Respiratory Aspiration><Respiratory Inspiration><Safety><Science><Stenosis><Structure><Suidae><Sum><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><Surgical sutures><Sutures><Swine><Technology><Testing><United States><Uremia><Veins><Venous><Work><anti-bacterial><arteriovenous graft><biocompatibility><biological material><biomaterial compatibility><commercial scale manufacturing><design><designing><dialysis therapy><economic cost><elastomeric><experience><hemodynamics><immune modulation><immune regulation><immunologic reactivity control><immunomodulatory><immunoregulation><immunoregulatory><in vitro testing><industrial partnership><industry partner><industry partnership><injuries><innovate><innovation><innovative><inspiration><interventional strategy><manufacture><manufacturing ramp-up><manufacturing scale-up><mechanic><mechanical><model of animal><morphometry><mortality><novel><pathway><polymer><polymeric><porcine><pressure><prototype><resistant><scale up><scale up batch><scale up production><seal><suid><surgery><three dimensional><upscale manufacturing><uremia of renal origin><vascular>,Assistive Technology; Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Kidney Disease; Transplantation
Refining iPSC-Based Spinal Cord Model Systems by Fabricating Developmentally Programmed Extracellular Matrix Cues,Refining iPSC-Based Spinal Cord Model Systems by Fabricating Developmentally Programmed Extracellular Matrix Cues,"ABSTRACT
Cellular reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technologies have provided unprecedented
access to the human central nervous system (CNS). They have enabled the assembly of models for the
investigation of neurodevelopment and neurological disease mechanisms, which have led to significant
advancements in our understanding of these processes. However, culturing iPSC-derived neurons in vitro
remains technically challenging. Neurons grown in cell autonomous systems exhibit insufficient levels of
morphological maturation, synaptic connectivity, metabolic function, and electrophysiological activity, while
transcriptional analyses suggest they resemble neurons of late embryonic to early postnatal stages hindering
the study of adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesize that the lack of a physiological,
developmentally appropriate extracellular matrix (ECM) platform is a major contributor to these limitations. The
ECM is an intricately organized intercellular scaffold of secreted proteins and complex sugars that configures
spatiotemporal microenvironments throughout the CNS. It provides critical structural support to neurons,
astrocytes, and glial cells, serves as a reservoir for soluble factors, and mediates cellular signaling. Through
these actions, the ECM can modulate neuronal development, maturation, and aging. However, the temporal
diversity and functional effects of the matrisome, defined as the ensemble of the ECM and ECM-associated
proteins, in the CNS is poorly characterized. As a result, the design of in vitro platforms for culturing iPSC-derived
neurons that truly recapitulate the physiological ECM is impossible. Here, we will refine iPSC-neuronal model
systems by providing developmentally appropriate ECM cues. In Aim 1 we will utilize biochemical purification
and quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics to define the composition and nature of remodeling
of the in vivo matrisome from extracted mouse spinal cords at 3 developmental stages (postnatal, adult, old). In
Aim 2 we will leverage our combined expertise in iPSC technologies and biomaterials to establish ECM mimetic
matrices that can recapitulate the architecture and modulatory activity of the physiological matrisome to facilitate
the maturation and aging of stem cell derived spinal motor neurons in vitro. In Aim 3 we will improve the
development and reproducibility of 3-D spinal organoids by growing them in structured scaffolds with
incorporated candidate ECM cues. Our proposed aims will shed light into the contribution of the temporal
matrisome on neuronal diversity, development and function and facilitate the establishment of physiological
iPSC-based spinal cord model systems.",<21+ years old><3-D><3-D print><3-D printer><3-Dimensional><3D><3D Print><3D printer><3D printing><Adult><Adult Human><Aging><Architecture><Astrocytes><Astrocytus><Astroglia><Biochemical><Biocompatible Materials><Biologic Models><Biological Models><Biomaterials><Body Tissues><CNS Nervous System><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Reprogramming><Cell Signaling><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cells><Central Nervous System><Complex><Cues><Data Set><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Development><ECM><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Embryo><Embryonic><Engineering / Architecture><Exhibits><Extracellular Matrix><Extracellular Matrix Proteins><Gene Expression><Gene Transcription><Generations><Genetic Transcription><Geometry><Glia><Glial Cells><Glycoprotein GP-2><Human><Hydrogels><Immunohistochemistry><Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue><Immunohistochemistry Staining Method><In Vitro><Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigation><Kolliker's reticulum><Laminin><Light><Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis><Mass Spectrometry><Mass Spectroscopy><Mass Spectrum><Mass Spectrum Analyses><Mass Spectrum Analysis><Mediating><Medulla Spinalis><Metabolic><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Model System><Modeling><Modern Man><Morphology><Motor Cell><Motor Neurons><Murine><Mus><Nature><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neural Cell><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural Development><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neuraxis><Neurocyte><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neuroglia><Neuroglial Cells><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neurologic Disorders><Neurological Disorders><Neuron from iPSC><Neuron from induced pluripotent stem cells><Neurons><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Non-neuronal cell><Nonneuronal cell><Organoids><Phase><Photoradiation><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiology><Process><Progenitor Cells><Protein Secretion><Proteins><Proteomics><RNA Expression><RNA Seq><RNA sequencing><RNAseq><Recombinant Proteins><Reproducibility><Research><Running><Sampling><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Spinal><Spinal Cord><Structure><Synapses><Synaptic><System><Technology><Testing><Tissues><Transcription><Tubular><Tubular formation><Work><adulthood><age associated><age correlated><age dependent><age linked><age related><age specific><aged mice><aged mouse><astrocytic glia><biological material><biological signal transduction><cellular reprogramming><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><design><designing><developmental><digital><elderly mice><electrophysiological><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><fetal><iPS><iPS neurons><iPSC><iPSC derived-neurons><iPSC technology><iPSCs><immunocytochemistry><improved><in vitro Model><in vivo><induced pluripotent cell><induced pluripotent stem cell><induced pluripotent stem cell neurons><induced pluripotent stem cell technology><inducible pluripotent stem cell><mechanical properties><mimetics><motoneuron><nerve cement><neurodegenerative illness><neurodevelopment><neurological disease><neuron development><neuronal><neuronal development><neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells><novel><old mice><patch clamp><postnatal><progenitor aging><progenitor cell aging><protein expression><rational design><scaffold><scaffolding><spatiotemporal><stem cell aging><stem cells><sugar><synapse><three dimensional><three dimensional printing><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing>,Aging; Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Human Fetal Tissue; Neurosciences; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - Human
Understanding and using microbial conductive nanowires,Understanding and using microbial conductive nanowires,"Abstract
Long-range (>10 μm) transport of electrons along networks of G. sulfurreducens protein filaments, known as
microbial nanowires, has been invoked to explain a wide range of globally important redox phenomena. The
remarkable electronic conduction capability of those nanowires has sparked a great deal of interest in the medical
application space, such as for building biocompatible materials and biosensor. For more than a decade, G.
sulfurreducens nanowires were thought to be bacterial type IV pili, supported by many indirect genetic and
biochemical observations. Recently we showed that these conductive nanowires are not made of type IV pilins.
Instead, these structures are a polymerized multi-heme c-type cytochrome, OmcS, which have never been
characterized before. The OmcS filament model is consistent with the known roles of OmcS in Geobacter
respiration, but our knowledge of cytochrome appendages is still very limited. This study aims at addressing
fundamental scientific questions about cytochrome filaments in respiring prokaryotes as well as applying our
discoveries into the general medical field. Specifically, I will: A) identify and characterize novel cytochrome
filaments in bacterial and archaeal strains, through bioinformatics algorithms followed by microscopic validation.
B) Then I will study the conduction mechanism of these filaments by high resolution cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) and conductivity measurement. C) Finally, based on these new insights into cytochrome
filaments, I will create a novel design for a self-assembled conductive nanowire. These nanowires may be
derived directly from a novel cytochrome filament or may contain a peptide/protein based self-assembled scaffold
core with soluble cytochromes appended to the outer surface. The results will advance our understanding of
cytochrome nanowires, as well as generating self-assembling nanowire scaffolds that may be used in many
future biomedical applications.",<Address><Algorithms><Amaze><Antibodies><Archaea><Archaebacteria><Archaeobacteria><Archaeon><Bacteria><Bio-Informatics><Biochemical><Biocompatible Materials><Bioinformatics><Biomaterials><Biophysical Process><Biosensor><Cell Body><Cells><Collaborations><Cryo-electron Microscopy><Cryoelectron Microscopy><Cytochrome c Group><Cytochromes><Cytochromes Type c><Data><Electron Cryomicroscopy><Electron Transport><Electronics><Electrons><Ferroprotoporphyrin><Fiber><Filament><Fimbriae Proteins><Future><Generalized Growth><Genetic><Geobacter><Growth><H element><Heme><Hydrogen><Knowledge><Label><Lead><Measurement><Measures><Medical><Mentors><Messenger RNA><Microbe><Microscopic><Modeling><Molecular><Morphology><Negative Beta Particle><Negatrons><Organism><Oxidants><Oxidation-Reduction><Oxidizing Agents><Pb element><Peptides><Pili Structural Proteins><Pilin><Pilum><Point Mutation><Polymers><Prokaryotae><Prokaryotic Cells><Proteins><Proteomics><Protoheme><Pyrobaculum><Recombinants><Redox><Resolution><Respiration><Role><Scaffolding Protein><Source><Structure><Surface><Techniques><Tissue Growth><Validation><Work><appendage><biological material><biological sensor><biophysical approaches><biophysical characteristics><biophysical characterization><biophysical measurement><biophysical mechanism><biophysical methodology><biophysical methods><biophysical parameters><biophysical properties><biophysical techniques><cryo-EM><cryoEM><cryogenic electron microscopy><design><designing><electron acceptor><electron transfer><electronic><electronic device><extracellular><ferroheme><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><heme C><imaging approach><imaging based approach><insight><interest><living system><mRNA><microbial><monomer><mutant><nano filament><nanofilament><nanowire><novel><ontogeny><oxidation reduction reaction><pilus><polymer><polymeric><prokaryote><rational design><resolutions><respiratory mechanism><scaffold><scaffolding><self assembly><social role><synthetic biology><validations>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Nanotechnology
Investigating sex differences in atrial remodeling and arrhythmia risk in aging,Investigating sex differences in atrial remodeling and arrhythmia risk in aging,"ABSTRACT
Aging is associated with increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation (AF). While AF affects <0.2% of people
under 49 years old, it occurs in ~6% of those over age 65 and ~9-17% in those over age 80. AF is associated
with increased morbidity and mortality through stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure and is
characterized by abnormal and rapid atrial electrical activity that arises due to adverse electrophysiological, Ca2+-
handling, structural, and autonomic remodeling. Despite age being a risk factor for the development of AF, how
natural age-associated remodeling makes the atria more susceptible to arrhythmias is not fully understood. An
additional layer of complexity is derived from potential sex differences in etiology. While males develop AF at an
earlier age, women with AF have worse symptoms, poor treatment outcomes and higher mortality. These
differences in the disease state may be reflective of sex differences in baseline atrial electrophysiology and the
age-associated remodeling that predisposes to AF. However, due to historic underrepresentation of females in
scientific and preclinical studies, sex differences in atrial electrophysiology associated with natural aging are
currently unclear. In line with the goals of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) to better understand the biology
of aging and disparities in age-related disease, the aim of this R03 Small Research Grant is to investigate sex
differences in atrial electrophysiological, structural, and autonomic remodeling in aging to determine how
biological differences in healthy aging may be predictive of arrhythmia risk. To do this, we will use a
translationally-relevant ‘middle-aged’ rabbit model that demonstrates age-associated changes that predispose
to AF, but is a timepoint before late-stage remodeling. We will take an integrative approach performing functional
in vivo, ex vivo and biochemical studies on 3-4 year old male and female rabbit hearts alongside complementary
computational modeling. Aim 1 will examine sex-specific electrophysiological characteristics and arrhythmia
susceptibility in the middle-aged atria through optical mapping, in vivo ECG recording, and quantification of
protein expression and fibrosis. Aim 2 will examine changes in autonomic modulation in middle-age and its role
in atrial arrhythmogenesis. Aim 3 will investigate ionic parameters that may predict arrhythmia risk. Together,
these experiments will characterize electrophysiological and autonomic changes in aging, evaluate age-
dependent arrhythmogenic mechanisms, and uncover novel predictive features underlying the transition from
healthy aging to AF.","<4 year old><4 years of age><65 and older><65 or older><65 years of age and older><65 years of age or more><65 years of age or older><65+ years><65+ years old><> 65 years><Ablation><Acetylcholine><Action Potentials><Acute><Affect><Age><Age disparity><Age of Onset><Aged 65 and Over><Aged, 80 and over><Aging><Agonist><Animals><Apoplexy><Arrhythmia><Atrial><Atrial Fibrillation><Auricular Fibrillation><Biochemical><Biochemical Markers><Biological><Biology of Aging><Biophysics><Body Tissues><Brain Vascular Accident><Cardiac Abnormalities><Cardiac Arrhythmia><Cardiac Atrium><Cardiac infarction><Causality><Cerebral Stroke><Cerebrovascular Apoplexy><Cerebrovascular Stroke><Cessation of life><Characteristics><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Computer Models><Computerized Models><Connexins><Data><Death><Development><Differences between sexes><Differs between sexes><Disease><Disorder><Domestic Rabbit><ECG><EKG><Electrocardiogram><Electrocardiography><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Etiology><Failure><Female><Fibrosis><Future><Gap Junction Proteins><Generations><Goals><Heart><Heart Abnormalities><Heart Arrhythmias><Heart Atrium><Heart failure><Heterogeneity><Human><Immunoblotting><Immunofluorescence><Immunofluorescence Immunologic><Individual><Investigation><Ion Channel><Ionic Channels><Knowledge><Levarterenol><Levonorepinephrine><Maps><Math Models><Membrane><Membrane Channels><Modeling><Modern Man><Morbidity><Morbidity -

Compartment-specific manipulation of NAD+ to mitigate post-injury kidney disease.,Compartment-specific manipulation of NAD+ to mitigate post-injury kidney disease.,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and its reduced form NADH, play crucial roles in maintaining tissue
homeostasis. We now know that NAD+ and NADH concentrations differ in different parts of the cell by orders of
magnitude. Nevertheless, how these distinct cellular pools of NAD+/NADH enable compartment specific
metabolic and regulatory functions, ensuring coordination of various cellular processes remains elusive.
NAD+/NADH compartmentalization is particularly important for the kidneys, in which tubule cells perform the
high-energy demanding task of reclaiming solutes filtered from the bloodstream and eliminating waste products
through urine. In acute kidney injury (AKI), a common condition in elderly patients, substantial decreases in the
levels of NAD+ impair energy generation in tubular epithelial cells leading to critical loss of cellular and organismal
homeostasis. Patients who survive AKI frequently develop chronic kidney disease (CKD), a condition
characterized by kidney fibrosis and inflammation leading to deleterious systemic effects. We and others have
shown that NAD+ boosting by cytoprotective approaches protects the kidney tubules against ischemia and other
insults. Furthermore, several experimental studies have demonstrated protective role for NAD+ precursor
supplementation against aging and AKI but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In particular, while the
cellular NAD+/NADH ratio is critical for energy metabolism, the extent to which it reflects versus drives metabolic
physiology in vivo is poorly understood. To successfully translate NAD-based therapeutics in humans, it is
essential to understand the molecular mechanisms by which this metabolite regulates kidney health. To this end,
recent technological advances that allow genetic manipulation of NAD+ in different cellular compartments, have
uncovered an exciting potential for revealing the multi-faceted effects of this fascinating molecule. The goal of
this proposal is to identify novel mechanisms by which directly increasing the NAD+/NADH promotes kidney
health in the context of injury and aging. To this end, we propose in vivo expression of Lactobacillus brevis
(Lb)NOX, a bacterial water forming NADH oxidase, in the cytosol or mitochondrial of kidney tubular cells. Two
specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will determine how boosting mitochondrial NAD+/NADH ratio in tubular
epithelial cells regulates kidney health following ischemic kidney injury. Aim 2 will define the role of boosting
cytosolic NAD+/NADH in tubular epithelial cells as a regulator of kidney health following ischemic kidney injury.
Completion of this project will generate exciting new insights in kidney biology and enable the development of
urgently needed novel therapeutics that protect kidney health.",<Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis><Affect><Aging><Automobile Driving><Autoregulation><B breve><B. breve><Bacillus casei g><Bacillus g><Betabacterium breve><Biological Function><Biological Process><Biology><Biosensor><Blood Circulation><Bloodstream><Body Tissues><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Cell Body><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Protection><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Chronic Kidney Failure><Chronic Renal Disease><Chronic Renal Failure><Citric Acid Cycle><Coenzyme II><Complex><Cytoplasm><Cytoprotection><Cytosol><DNA Recombination><Data><Development><Dihydronicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide><Diphosphopyridine Nucleotide><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Drug Kinetics><Ectopic Expression><Electron Transport><Electrons><Energy Expenditure><Energy Metabolism><Ensure><Enzyme Gene><Enzymes><Epithelial Cells><Event><Face><Fibrosis><GEM model><GEMM model><Gene Transcription><Generations><Genes><Genetic Recombination><Genetic Transcription><Genetically Engineered Mouse><Glycolysis><Goals><Health><Heart Vascular><Homeostasis><Human><Hydrogen Oxide><Impairment><Inflammation><Injury><Injury to Kidney><Investigation><Ischemia><KI mice><Kidney><Kidney Diseases><Kidney Tubules><Kidney Urinary System><Knock-in Mouse><Knowledge><Krebs Cycle><L breve><L brevis><L. breve><L. brevis><Lactobacillus brevis><Lactobacterium breve><Link><Mediating><Metabolic><Mice><Mice Mammals><Mitochondria><Modern Man><Molecular><Murine><Mus><NAD phosphate><NAD(H) phosphate><NADH><NADH oxidase><NADH phosphate><NADP><NADPH><Nadide><Natural regeneration><Negative Beta Particle><Negatrons><Nephropathy><Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide><Nicotinamide-Adenine Dinucleotide><Nicotinamide-Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate><Organ><Oxidation-Reduction><Patients><Pharmacokinetics><Physiological Homeostasis><Physiology><Play><Production><Publishing><QOL><Quality of life><RNA Expression><Recombination><Redox><Regeneration><Regulation><Renal Disease><Renal function><Renal tubule structure><Reporting><Role><Scheme><Signaling Molecule><Stress><Subcellular Process><Supplementation><System><TCA cycle><Technology><Therapeutic><Tissues><Transcription><Transgenic Mice><Transgenic Organisms><Translating><Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle><Triphosphopyridine Nucleotide><Tubular><Tubular formation><Urine><Validation><Waste Products><Water><acute kidney injury><age associated decline><age dependent decline><age related decline><aged mice><aged mouse><biological sensor><chronic kidney disease><circulatory system><cofactor><cytoprotective><decline with age><developmental><driving><effective therapy><effective treatment><elderly mice><elderly patient><electron transfer><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><faces><facial><fascinate><gene manipulation><genetic manipulation><genetically engineered mouse model><genetically engineered murine model><genetically manipulate><genetically perturb><improved><in vivo><inducible expression><inducible gene expression><injuries><insight><kidney disorder><kidney fibrosis><kidney function><kidney injury><kidney ischemia><kidney preservation><knockin mice><metabolism measurement><metabolomics><metabonomics><mitochondrial><mitochondrial metabolism><mouse model><murine model><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new therapeutics><new therapy><next generation therapeutics><novel><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><old mice><older patient><oxidation reduction reaction><prevent><preventing><regenerate><renal><renal disorder><renal fibrosis><renal injury><renal ischemia><renal tubule><repair><repaired><resilience><resilient><response><social role><solute><sonar><transcriptomics><transgenic><validations>,Aging; Biotechnology; Kidney Disease
Detecting respiratory distress in nursing home patients with advanced ADRD using radio sensors,Detecting respiratory distress in nursing home patients with advanced ADRD using radio sensors,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Overview: The proposal aims to advance the science of geriatric palliative care by assessing the feasibility and
acceptability of implementing radio frequency (RF) sensors to capture cardiopulmonary measures in nursing
home (NH) patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) and using machine learning to
help predict when a patient may be experiencing an episode of respiratory distress.
Background: In NH patients with advanced ADRD, respiratory distress is common and can occur in up to 80%
of patients. Respiratory distress can lead to negative patient outcomes such as increased suffering, poor quality
of life, and unwanted care transitions. Given that ADRD
approximately
patients make up 48% of all NH residents, with
60% of those having moderate to severe cognitive impairment,it is critical that we find ways to
better identify and detect respiratory distress in this vulnerable patient population.
Research plan: The proposal aims to (1) assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing RF sensors to
capture cardiopulmonary waveforms in NH patients with advanced ADRD and (2) develop a machine learning
algorithm that will autonomously detect and predict respiratory distress using collected cardiopulmonary
recordings. Furthermore, interviews will be conducted with NH staff and legal authorized representatives of
patients with dementia to gain insight into the potential use and challenges of implementing RF sensors to help
in the detection and prediction of respiratory distress in patients with advanced ADRD.
Environment: The study team is a distinguished group with expertise in geriatrics, palliative medicine,
pulmonary medicine, and biosensor technology/artificial intelligence. By combining the resources at Weill

Mechanisms of Lamin A/C-mediated Cardiac Conduction Disorders,Mechanisms of Lamin A/C-mediated Cardiac Conduction Disorders,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The cardiac conduction system (CCS) is specialized in the generation and propagation of electrical impulses
from the atria to the ventricles to produce a highly coordinated muscle contraction. Cardiac conduction disorders
(CCDs) including sick sinus syndrome, atrioventricular block (AVB), and bundle branch block are common
arrhythmic disorders that impact the contraction of atria or ventricles. Cardiac pacing is the standard treatment
for patients with symptomatic bradyarrhythmia resulting in implantation of over 600,000 pacemakers annually in
US due to sinus node dysfunction (SND) or AVB. Currently, there is no alternative treatment for these patients.
Thus, understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to CCD may provide a foundation for new
therapeutic strategies. A nonsense mutation (c.C673>T, p.R225>X) in lamin A/C (LMNA) identified in a kindred,
was associated progressive CCD and atrial arrhythmias, preceding the development of cardiomyopathy and
heart failure. The mechanistic link between mutated lamin A/C and CCD is largely undetermined. Preliminary
results suggest that the LMNA-R255X knockin mice develop CCD phenotype, similar to patient carriers of R225X
mutation. The proposed work will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which mutation in lamin A/C promote
CCD. Our study will establish the pathological function of lamin A/C in CCD development. The molecular
pathways uncovered from this study will likely have a broader impact on our understanding of the molecular
mechanisms of CCD in the general population.",<3-D structure><3-dimensional structure><3D structure><A-V Node><ATAC sequencing><ATAC-seq><ATACseq><AV Node><Action Potentials><Affect><Age><Age Months><Arrhythmia><Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing><Atrial><Atrio-Ventricular Node><Atrioventricular Block><Attenuated><Body Tissues><Bradyarrhythmias><Bundle Branch disorder><Bundle-Branch Block><C protein><Cardiac><Cardiac Arrhythmia><Cardiac Atrium><Cardiac Block><Cardiac Chronotropism><Cardiac conduction system><Cardiomyopathies><Cell Body><Cell Differentiation><Cell Differentiation process><Cells><Cessation of life><Chromatin Structure><Congestive Cardiomyopathy><Crossbreeding><Death><Development><Dilated Cardiomyopathy><Dimensions><Disease><Disorder><Dysfunction><ECG><EKG><Echocardiogram><Echocardiography><Electrocardiogram><Electrocardiography><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Family><Fibrosis><Foundations><Functional disorder><Gene Expression><General Population><General Public><Generations><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic Hybridization><Genetic defect><Goals><Heart><Heart Arrhythmias><Heart Atrium><Heart Block><Heart Conduction System><Heart Rate><Heart failure><Heterozygote><Histology><Impairment><Injections><Ion Channel><Ionic Channels><KI mice><KO mice><Knock-in Mouse><Knock-out Mice><Knockout Mice><Lamin A><Lamin Type A><Lamins><Left><Light><Link><LoxP-flanked allele><Maps><Mediating><Membrane Channels><Mice><Mice Mammals><Microscopy><Molecular><Murine><Mus><Muscle Cell Contraction><Muscle Contraction><Muscle Disease><Muscle Disorders><Muscular Contraction><Muscular Diseases><Mutate><Mutation><Myocardial Diseases><Myocardial Disorder><Myocardiopathies><Myopathic Conditions><Myopathic Diseases and Syndromes><Myopathic disease or syndrome><Myopathy><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Nodal><Nonsense Mutation><Null Mouse><Optics><Pace Stimulators><Pacemakers><Pathogenesis><Pathologic><Pathway interactions><Patients><Phenotype><Photoradiation><Physiopathology><Predisposition><RNA Seq><RNA sequencing><RNAseq><Refractory><Regulation><Reporter><Role><SA node dysfunction><Sick Sinus Syndrome><Skeletal Muscle><Surface><Susceptibility><System><Tamoxifen><Testing><Therapeutic><Time><Tissues><Transthoracic Echocardiography><Type V IF Protein><Ventricular><Ventricular Arrhythmia><Voluntary Muscle><Work><ages><alternative treatment><assay for transposase accessible chromatin followed by sequencing><assay for transposase accessible chromatin seq><assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing><assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing><atrioventricular node><atrium><attenuate><attenuates><calcium-activated potassium channel small-conductance><cardiac failure><cardiac pacemaker cell><cardiac pacing><cellular differentiation><citrate carrier><citrate periplasmic carrier protein><citrate transporter><citrate-binding transport protein><developmental><electrophysiological><epigenetic regulation><floxed><floxed allele><genome mutation><heart sonography><heterozygosity><histologic studies><histological studies><imaging study><implantation><induced Cre><inducible Cre><insight><kindred><knockin mice><mouse model><murine model><muscular disorder><myocardium disease><myocardium disorder><new therapeutic approach><new therapeutic intervention><new therapeutic strategies><new therapy approaches><new treatment approach><new treatment strategy><nodal myocyte><non-sense mutation><novel><novel therapeutic approach><novel therapeutic intervention><novel therapeutic strategies><novel therapy approach><optical><pacemaker cell><patch clamp><pathophysiology><pathway><postnatal><sinoatrial node dysfunction><sinus node dysfunction><social role><standard care><standard treatment><three dimensional structure><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing><tricarboxylate carrier><tricarboxylate transporter><tricarboxylate-binding C protein>,Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Genetics; Heart Disease
Alternative polyadenylation in Right Ventricular Fibrosis,Alternative polyadenylation in Right Ventricular Fibrosis,"Project Summary:
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a cardiovascular disorder characterized by high mortality, primarily due to right
ventricular (RV) failure (RVF) caused by increased pulmonary vascular resistance. RV fibrosis, a hallmark of
decompensated RVF, lacks targeted therapies, highlighting the need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
underlying RV fibrosis and dysfunction.
Our research focuses on the role of alternative polyadenylation (APA), a process associated with excessive
production of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, in RV fibrosis. APA shortens the 3' untranslated region (UTR)
of transcripts, leading to loss of microRNA binding sites and increased transcript stability. We have identified
Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specific Factor 6 (CPSF6), a key regulator of APA, as being involved in end-
stage RVF. In RVF patients, CPSF6 exhibits lengthened 3' UTR and decreased protein expression. Silencing
CPSF6 in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) results in 3' UTR shortening and upregulation of major fibrotic mediators,
including TGF-β1 and its receptor, TGFβR1. Pathway analysis further supports 3' UTR shortening in mRNAs
encoding ECM proteins in CPSF6 knockdown CFs. Additionally, we have discovered the role of 4-hydroxy-2-
nonenal (4HNE), a reactive aldehyde generated during oxidative stress, in RVF. Increased 4HNE downregulates
CPSF6, inducing 3' UTR shortening in profibrotic genes and promoting RV fibrosis. The proposed research aims
to investigate these mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets for mitigating RV fibrosis. Our hypothesis posits
that CPSF6 depletion shortens the 3' UTRs of ECM genes, causing their escape from regulation, promoting their
expression, and leading to RV fibrosis. Specifically, we will: Investigate the impact of CPSF6 loss on the 3' UTR
landscape and profibrotic gene expression in RVF (Specific Aim 1). Uncover the mechanism underlying CPSF6
reduction-dependent 3' UTR shortening in CFs and its functional consequences in RVF (Specific Aim 2). Assess
the impact of ALDH2 restoration on alleviating RV fibrosis through CPSF6 regulation (Specific Aim 3).
The validation of our hypotheses and the completion of these aims will highlight the importance of 3' UTR
shortening in ECM deposition and fibrosis in RVF, potentially guiding the development of therapeutic
interventions. Given the limited treatment options and severe consequences of PH, our research holds significant
promise for improving public health.","<3' Untranslated Regions><3'UTR><4 hydroxynonenal><4-HNE cpd><4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal><4-hydroxy-2-nonenal><4-hydroxynonen-2-al><ALDH><Aldehydes><Amino Acids><Attenuated><Binding Sites><Body Tissues><Cardiac><Cardiovascular Diseases><Causality><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Clinical><Combining Site><Common Rat Strains><Data><Deposit><Deposition><Development><Down-Regulation><Dysfunction><ECM><Enzyme Gene><Enzymes><Etiology><Event><Exhibits><Extracellular Matrix><Extracellular Matrix Proteins><Fibroblasts><Fibrosis><Fibrosis in the heart><Fibrosis in the myocardium><Fibrosis within the heart><Fibrosis within the myocardium><Fibrotic myocardium><Functional disorder><Gene Expression><Genes><Genetic><Impairment><In Vitro><Lead><Length><Lipid Peroxidation><Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis><Mass Spectrometry><Mass Spectroscopy><Mass Spectrum><Mass Spectrum Analyses><Mass Spectrum Analysis><Mediating><Mediator><Messenger RNA><Mice><Mice Mammals><Micro RNA><MicroRNAs><Modeling><Molecular><Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry><Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry><Molecular Models><Murine><Mus><Myofibroblast><Network Analysis><Outcome><Oxidative Stress><Oxidative Stress Induction><Pathogenesis><Pathway Analysis><Patients><Pb element><Physiopathology><Polyadenylation><Process><Production><Proteins><Public Health><Pulmonary Hypertension><Pulmonary Vascular Resistance><RNA Polyadenylation><Rat><Rats Mammals><Rattus><Reactive Site><Receptor Protein><Regulation><Regulatory Element><Research><Right Ventricular Function><Role><Site><Site-Directed Mutagenesis><Site-Specific Mutagenesis><Targeted DNA Modification><Targeted Modification><Techniques><Testing><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Intervention><Tissues><Transcript><Translations><Up-Regulation><Upregulation><Validation><Ventricular><adduct><aldehyde dehydrogenases><aminoacid><attenuate><attenuates><cardiac fibrosis><cardiovascular disorder><causation><coronary fibrosis><design><designing><developmental><disease causation><fibrotic heart><heart fibrosis><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><improved><in vivo><intervention therapy><knock-down><knockdown><mRNA><miRNA><miRNAs><molecular modeling><mortality><mutant><myocardial fibrosis><new drug target><new druggable target><new pharmacotherapy target><new therapeutic target><new therapy target><novel><novel drug target><novel druggable target><novel pharmacotherapy target><novel therapeutic target><novel therapy target><overexpress><overexpression><pathophysiology><pharmacologic><protein expression><receptor><restoration><right heart failure><right sided heart failure><right ventricle failure><right ventricle remodeling><right ventricular failure><right ventricular heart failure><right ventricular remodeling><social role><targeted drug therapy><targeted drug treatments><targeted therapeutic><targeted therapeutic agents><targeted therapy><targeted treatment><therapeutic agent development><therapeutic development><therapeutic target><translation><validations>",Cardiovascular; Genetics; Heart Disease; Pulmonary Hypertension
Mechanisms of right ventricular dysfunction in type 2 diabetes,Mechanisms of right ventricular dysfunction in type 2 diabetes,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart failure in the presence of diabetes is common, expensive, and growing in significance, with some
estimates suggesting that diabetic cardiomyopathy is present in up to 60% of patients with diabetes. While
typically thought of as a disease of the left ventricle, right ventricular (RV) remodeling also occurs and
contributes to disease pathogenesis. In multiple clinical conditions, RV dysfunction is the strongest predictor of
mortality, clearly highlighting the significance of maintaining RV function. Despite the strong link between RV
function and survival, understanding of the diabetic RV is limited and thus there is a critical need to identify
mechanisms of RV-specific remodeling in the diabetic heart. In the setting of diabetes, altered myocardial
substrate metabolism causes oxidative stress, which together contribute to LV dysfunction. However, despite
strong rationale for these mechanisms in the diabetic LV, they are unstudied in the RV. The purpose of this
Katz Early Stage Investigator proposal is to identify RV-specific mechanisms of diabetic myopathy. To achieve
this goal, we propose to 1) determine the mechanism by which fatty acid uptake contributes to RV lipotoxicity
and dysfunction, and 2) identify mechanisms of impaired reactive oxygen species signaling in the diabetic RV.
Together, we will demonstrate that RV dysfunction is significant in diabetes by a mechanism involving
lipotoxicity and oxidative stress. Identifying RV-centric mechanisms of disease is critical to advance our long-
term goal of identifying treatments for the failing RV. If RV mechanisms are distinct from those in the LV, then
current therapeutic approaches will be limited in improving RV function and patient outcomes. This novel and
innovative body of work will lay the groundwork for future larger efforts aimed at understanding the
mechanisms of diabetic RV cardiomyopathy and the identification of therapies for this unmet public health
need.",<Active Oxygen><Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus><Biology><CD36><CD36 Antigens><CD36 Fatty Acid Transporter><CD36 gene><Cardiomyopathies><Cardiovascular Diseases><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Clinical><Development><Diabetes Mellitus><Disease><Disorder><Dysfunction><Fatty Acid Metabolism Pathway><Fatty Acids><Functional disorder><Future><GP3B><GP4><GPIV><GPIV Platelet Glycoprotein><Genetic><Genetic Models><Goals><Heart><Heart failure><IPO-B><Impairment><Indophenol Oxidase B><Insulin Resistance><Intermediary Metabolism><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigation><Investigators><Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus><Left><Left Ventricles><Left Ventricular Dysfunction><Left Ventricular Function><Left ventricular structure><Link><MNSOD><Manganese Superoxide Dismutase><Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus><Metabolic><Metabolic Processes><Metabolic dysfunction><Metabolism><Mitochondria><Mitochondrial Superoxide Dismutase><Mn Superoxide Dismutase><Mn-SOD><Modeling><Muscle Disease><Muscle Disorders><Muscular Diseases><Myocardial><Myocardial Diseases><Myocardial Disorder><Myocardiopathies><Myopathic Conditions><Myopathic Diseases and Syndromes><Myopathic disease or syndrome><Myopathy><NIDDM><Needles><Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes><Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus><Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes><Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus><Oxidative Stress><Oxygen Radicals><Pathogenesis><Pathologic><Patient outcome><Patient-Centered Outcomes><Patient-Focused Outcomes><Patients><Physiopathology><Pro-Oxidants><Production><Public Health><Reactive Oxygen Species><Reporting><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Resolution><Right Ventricles><Right Ventricular Dysfunction><Right Ventricular Function><Right heart dysfunction><Right ventricle dysfunction><Right ventricular structure><Right-sided heart dysfunction><SCARB3><SOD2><SOD2 gene><Side><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus><Spirometry><Stable Diabetes Mellitus><Superoxide Dismutase 2><T2 DM><T2D><T2DM><Testing><Therapeutic><Thrombospondin Receptors><Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus><Type 2 diabetes><Type II Diabetes Mellitus><Type II diabetes><Ventricle Remodeling><Ventricular><Ventricular Cardiac Remodeling><Ventricular Myocardial Remodeling><Ventricular Remodeling><adult onset diabetes><anti-oxidant enzyme><antioxidant enzyme><biological signal transduction><cardiac failure><cardiovascular disorder><decline in function><decline in functional status><developmental><diabetes><diabetic><diabetic cardiomyopathy><diabetic cardiopathy><diabetic cardiopathy disease><diabetic cardiopathy disorder><diabetic cardiovascular disease><diabetic cardiovascular disorder><fatty acid metabolism><functional decline><functional status decline><gain of function><glucose uptake><improved><innovate><innovation><innovative><insulin resistant><insulin tolerance><ketosis resistant diabetes><left ventricle abnormality><loss of function><maturity onset diabetes><metabolic phenotype><metabotype><mitochondrial><mitochondrial dysfunction><molecular phenotype><mortality><muscular disorder><myocardial remodeling><myocardium disease><myocardium disorder><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new therapeutics><new therapy><next generation therapeutics><non-diabetic><nondiabetic><novel><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><overexpress><overexpression><oxidative damage><oxidative injury><pathophysiology><patient oriented outcomes><poor health outcome><reduced health outcome><resolutions><response><right ventricle remodeling><right ventricular remodeling><type 2 DM><type II DM><type two diabetes><uptake><worse health outcome>,Cardiovascular; Diabetes; Heart Disease; Pulmonary Hypertension
R-FIX (Rib-FIXation) Spinal Growth System for Early-onset Spinal Deformity,R-FIX (Rib-FIXation) Spinal Growth System for Early-onset Spinal Deformity,"Project Summary
Early-onset spinal deformity is a subset of pediatric spinal deformity that begins before the age of 10 years.
Unlike adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, it is a life-threatening disease, which makes early intervention crucial.
Surgical intervention must accommodate the growth of the developing spine, making this one of the most
challenging orthopedic conditions to treat. Current intra-spinal based treatments, such as growing rods with
pedicle screw fixation, have high complication rates and limited effectiveness. The R-FIX (Rib-FIXation) Spinal
Growth System is an alternative extra-spinal technique that uses rib-based fixation for correcting early-onset
spinal deformity. This extra-spinal rib fixation is a paradigm shift from seeking correction of the spine to
emphasizing correction of thorax malalignment. The R-FIX System originated from a bioengineering lab (one of
the applicants' labs) at Clemson University and has been further developed by Apex Orthopaedic Technologies.
The R-FIX Spinal Growth System has been granted breakthrough device designation by the FDA. The objective
of this SBIR Phase II award is threefold: 1) complete the final design, manufacturing, and quality control
processes for the new R-FIX System components, 2) obtain the necessary biomechanical, biocompatibility, and
sterility data resulting in successful 510(k) clearance of the R-FIX System, and 3) demonstrate the safety and
efficacy of new R-FIX uni-axial rib hook and rib band designs in an animal model. This research will be conducted
over 24 months and the data obtained from this grant proposal will result in a 510(k) application for FDA
clearance and follow-up NIAMS pediatric medical device initiative clinical trial application. Major milestones to
be achieved with this grant include 1) validation of new implantable R-FIX components with surgeon feedback,
2) completion of benchtop performance testing and FDA 510(k) submission, and 3) assessment of the safety
and efficacy of new R-FIX components compared to pedicle screws in a pediatric hyperkyphosis porcine animal
model.","<0-11 years old><10 year old><10 years of age><21+ years old><3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><Active Follow-up><Acute><Adolescent><Adolescent Youth><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><Airway failure><Anatomic Abnormality><Anatomical Abnormality><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Apical><Applications Grants><Award><Biomechanics><Biomedical Engineering><Breakthrough device><Cadaver><Cardiac Diseases><Cardiac Disorders><Cardiopulmonary><Causality><Chest><Child><Child Youth><Childhood><Children (0-21)><Clinical Trials><Complex><Complication><Contracting Opportunities><Contracts><Data><Deformity><Development><Disease><Disorder><Distal><Early Intervention><Early treatment><Effectiveness><Epiphyseal Plate><Epiphysial cartilage><Etiology><Failure><Family><Family suidae><Feedback><Fixation><Fracture><Future><Generalized Growth><Goals><Grant><Grant Proposals><Grips><Growth><Growth Plate><Heart Diseases><Histologic><Histologically><Human><Hyperkyphosis><Idiopathic scoliosis><Implant><Kyphosis><Kyphosis deformity of spine><Left><Life><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Lytotoxicity><Manufacturer><Mechanics><Medical><Medical Device><Medulla Spinalis><Methods><Modern Man><Modernization><NIAMS><National Institute of Arthritis, and Musculoskeletal, and Skin Diseases><Nervous System Injuries><Nervous System Trauma><Nervous System damage><Neurologic Deficit><Neurological Damage><Neurological Injury><Neurological trauma><Oncology><Oncology Cancer><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Orthopedic><Orthopedic Surgery><Orthopedic Surgical Profession><Orthopedics><Osteoporosis><Pathology><Patients><Phase><Pigs><Position><Positioning Attribute><Prevention><Procedures><Process><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Quality Control><Research><Respiratory Failure><Ribs><Risk><Rod><SBIR><Safety><Secondary to><Series><Site><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Societies><Spinal><Spinal Column><Spinal Cord><Spinal Cord Trauma><Spinal Fusion><Spinal Trauma><Spinal cord injured><Spinal cord injury><Spine><Spondylosyndeses><Sterility><Structure><Suidae><Surgeon><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><Survey Instrument><Surveys><Swine><System><Techniques><Technology><Testing><Thorace><Thoracic><Thorax><Tissue Growth><Torsion><Toxicity Testing><Toxicity Tests><Traction><Traumatic Myelopathy><Treatment Cost><Universities><Validation><Vertebrae><Vertebral><Vertebral column><active followup><adulthood><age 10 years><backbone><bio-engineered><bio-engineers><biocompatibility><bioengineering><biological engineering><biomaterial compatibility><biomechanical><biomechanical analyses><biomechanical analysis><biomechanical assessment><biomechanical characterization><biomechanical evaluation><biomechanical measurement><biomechanical profiling><biomechanical test><bone fracture><cadaveric><cadavers><causation><cytotoxicity><design><designing><determine efficacy><developmental><disease causation><early onset><early therapy><economic cost><effective therapy><effective treatment><efficacy analysis><efficacy assessment><efficacy determination><efficacy evaluation><efficacy examination><evaluate efficacy><examine efficacy><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><grasp><heart disorder><high risk><implant design><improved><in vivo><innovate><innovation><innovative><instrument><instrumentation><juvenile><juvenile human><kids><manufacture><mechanic><mechanical><meeting><meetings><model of animal><mortality><neurosurgery><neurotrauma><new technology><novel><novel technologies><ontogeny><pediatric><performance tests><porcine><psychologic><psychological><pulmonary><rib bone structure><safety assessment><sample fixation><scoliosis><skeletal><spine bone structure><sterile><sterility testing><suid><surgery><ten year old><ten years of age><three dimensional><validations><youngster>",Bioengineering; Neurosciences; Pediatric
Multi-Lineage Modulation of cardiac neural crest cells during cardiac development,Multi-Lineage Modulation of cardiac neural crest cells during cardiac development,"Project Abstract
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect with complex CHD causing significant morbidity/
mortality. Therapies targeting adult heart failure have been ineffective in treating heart failure in patients with CHD,
which implies different pathomechanisms of congestive heart failure in patients with CHD compared with those with
structurally normal hearts. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the genetic basis of CHDs. Genetic analysis
in CHD patients is confounded by the genetic heterogeneity of the human population. Hence, we used large-scale
chemical/N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis in inbred mice to recover mutations that cause CHD. We recovered
mutations in ten vesicular/endocytic trafficking proteins, including a missense mutation (C4232R) in the highly
conserved epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeat domain encoding low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1
(LRP1). All Lrp1m/m mutant mice exhibited CHD comprising outflow tract (OFT) malalignment defects and/or
atrioventricular (AV) septal defects. Conditional knockout of Lrp1 in different cell lineages that are crucial in cardiac
development demonstrated ablation of cardiac neural crest cells (CNCC) using Wnt1-Cre driver recapitulate the
phenotypes of ENU-induced mutants. Interestingly, these Cre deletion experiments also showed Lrp1 deficiency in
other cell lineages along the CNCC migratory path generated with Nkx2-5+/cre, Tie2+/cre also yielded either double outlet
right ventricle (DORV), atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), or ventricular septal defect (VSD) phenotypes. As these are
observed with variable penetrance, they suggest CNCC migration to the heart is supported by redundant signaling to
ensure high fidelity of CNCC deployment to the heart. In addition, the combined double knockout of Nkx2-5+/cre Tie2+/cre:
Lrp1f/f mutants demonstrated synergistic effects which reflect the complex genetics in human CHD. Based on findings
from a large body of preliminary data, we hypothesize that LRP1 is required in the cardiac neural crest lineage and its
migratory path for proper OFT alignment and development of the atrioventricular cushions (AVC). We will investigate
this with a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments conducted using Wnt1+/cre: Lrp1f/f mutant mice with Lrp1
deletion targeted to the CNCCs and double knockout of Nkx2-5+/cre Tie2+/cre: Lrp1f/f mutants. First, we will investigate the
deployment of CNCCs with in vitro migration studies in combination with in vivo cell lineage fate mapping analysis (Aim
1). We will further investigate the cellular and molecular basis for how Lrp1 deficiency in CNCCs can lead to OFT and AV
valve defects by conducting single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, as well as in vivo and in vitro analysis of endocytic
trafficking (Aim 2). This will include the examination of endocytic trafficking related to cell signaling pathways identified
in the CNCC and its migratory path. We will also investigate the clinical relevance of LRP1 mutations in human CHD by
generating CRISPR gene-edited mice bearing LRP1 mutations recovered from CHD patients (Aim 3). This will include an
analysis of heterozygous mutations to assess a dominant genetic model of disease, as well as compound heterozygous
mutations to investigate a recessive genetic model of disease. Together, these studies will provide novel mechanistic
insights into the role of endocytic trafficking in the pathogenesis of human CHD.",<1-Ethyl-1-nitrosourea><21+ years old><AVSD><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><Alleles><Allelomorphs><Anthelone U><Apo E Receptor><ApoE Receptor><Apolipoprotein E Receptor><Birth Defects><CRISPR><CRISPR/Cas system><Cardiac><Cardiac Failure Congestive><Cardiac Malformation><Cardiac ablation><Cardiac development><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Catheter Ablation><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Lineage><Cell Locomotion><Cell Migration><Cell Movement><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cellular Migration><Cellular Motility><Chemicals><Children's Hospital><Clinical Management><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats><Complex><Congenital Abnormality><Congenital Anatomical Abnormality><Congenital Defects><Congenital Deformity><Congenital Malformation><Congestive Heart Failure><Cre driver><Data><Defect><Development><Disease><Disorder><Dominant Genetic Conditions><Dominant trait><Double Outlet Right Ventricle><ENU><Embryo><Embryonic><Ensure><Epidermal Growth Factor><Epidermal Growth Factor-Urogastrone><Ethylnitrosourea><Exhibits><Genes><Genetic><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic Diseases><Genetic Dominant><Genetic Heterogeneity><Genetic Predisposition><Genetic Predisposition to Disease><Genetic Screening><Genetic Susceptibility><Genetic analyses><Genetic defect><Genetic propensity><Genetics-Mutagenesis><Heart><Heart Decompensation><Heart Malformation><Heart Vascular><Heart failure><Heterozygote><Hind Brain><Human><In Vitro><Inbred Mouse><Individual><Inherited Predisposition><Inherited Susceptibility><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><KI mice><KO mice><Knock-in Mouse><Knock-out><Knock-out Mice><Knockout><Knockout Mice><LDL-Receptor Related Protein 1><Lipoprotein Receptor><Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein><Low-Density-Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-1><LoxP-flanked allele><Maps><Mesenchymal><Mice><Mice Mammals><Missense Mutation><Modern Man><Molecular><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Murine><Mus><Mutagenesis><Mutagenesis Molecular Biology><Mutant Strains Mice><Mutation><N-Ethyl-N-nitrosourea><N-ethyl-N-nitroso-urea><Neural Crest><Neural Crest Cell><Neural tube><Nitrosoethylurea><Nitrosourea Compounds><Null Mouse><Pathogenesis><Pathogenicity><Pathway interactions><Patients><Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium><Pediatric Hospitals><Penetrance><Phenotype><Population><Protein Trafficking><Proteins><Public Health><Receptor Protein><Recovery><Reporter><Research><Rhombencephalon><Role><Signal Pathway><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Supporting Cell><Taussig-Bing Anomaly><Time><United States><Urogastrone><Variant><Variation><Ventricular Heart Septal Defects><Ventricular Septal Defects><abnormal heart development><adulthood><alpha-2-Macroglobulin Receptor><alpha2-Macroglobulin Signaling Receptor><atrioventricular canal defect><atrioventricular septal defect><beta-Urogastrone><biological signal transduction><cardiac failure><cardiogenesis><cell motility><chronic heart failure><circulatory system><clinical relevance><clinically relevant><cohort><conditional knock-out><conditional knockout><congenital cardiac abnormality><congenital cardiac anomalies><congenital cardiac disease><congenital cardiac disorder><congenital cardiac malformation><congenital heart abnormality><congenital heart anomaly><congenital heart disease><congenital heart disorder><congenital heart malformation><developmental><disease model><disease phenotype><disorder model><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><floxed><floxed allele><genetic analysis><genetic condition><genetic disorder><genetic etiology><genetic mechanism of disease><genetic recessive><genetic vulnerability><genetically predisposed><genome mutation><heart cell><heart development><heart disease prevention><heart disorder prevention><heart formation><heterozygosity><hindbrain><human disease><implantation><in vivo><insight><knockin mice><migration><mortality><mouse mutant><mutant><mutation scanning><mutation screening><neonate><nitrosourea><novel><pathway><prenatal><prevent><prevent heart disease><preventing><protein transport><receptor><recessive genetic trait><recessive trait><scRNA-seq><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single-cell RNA sequencing><social role><targeted drug therapy><targeted drug treatments><targeted therapeutic><targeted therapeutic agents><targeted therapy><targeted treatment><trafficking><transcriptome profiling><transcriptomic profiling><unborn>,Cardiovascular; Congenital Heart Disease; Congenital Structural Anomalies; Genetics; Heart Disease; Pediatric; Rare Diseases
Determining the Mechanisms of Radiation Biomodulation of the Ventricular Tachycardia Arrhythmogenic Substate,Determining the Mechanisms of Radiation Biomodulation of the Ventricular Tachycardia Arrhythmogenic Substate,"Project Summary
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and accounts for 1 in every 5 deaths.
Sudden cardiac death is responsible for nearly half of all heart disease related mortality and is often attributed
to the occurrence of lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular arrhythmias also are a major source of morbidity
and mortality in patients with structural heart disease. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy provides only limited efficacy
in preventing ventricular arrhythmias and while implantable cardioverter defibrillators provide life-saving therapy
to terminate the arrhythmia once it has occurred, they do not prevent them from occurring. For these reasons,
catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias has emerged as an additional therapy for many patients with
refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT). However, VT ablation procedures are complex and multiple procedures
are often required to achieve modest long-term success. Therefore, there is a critical need for additional VT
therapies. Cardiac stereotactic body radiation therapy (cSBRT) has emerged as an adjunctive noninvasive
approach that can be utilized to treat patients with VT that is refractory to standard antiarrhythmic drug therapy
and catheter ablation with clinical efficacy observed in some very complex patients. However, the clinical
response following cSBRT has been highly variable and the electrophysiologic mechanism is unclear. We
believe that better understanding the mechanisms of cSBRT will help refine and guide clinical cSBRT paradigms,
optimize patient selection, and better define the appropriate role this therapy should have in clinical practice. We
propose a series of experiments to investigate the association between cSBRT dose and structural and
electrophysiologic changes using longitudinal cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and high-resolution
electroanatomic mapping in a large animal model of chronic myocardial infarction and reentrant VT. In Aim 1,
we will investigate the impact of cSBRT dose (15Gy, 25Gy, and 35Gy) at short and intermediate follow-up
timepoints. We will also investigate the long-term impact of cSBRT delivered at the dose currently used clinically
(25Gy) out to 1 year. In Aim 2, we will similarly investigate structural and electrophysiologic changes that occur
in patients undergoing clinically indicated cSBRT compared to catheter ablation. This study will give a new
understanding of the dose and time relationship of cSBRT on the heart that will be essential in moving this field
forward.","<Ablation><Abnormal heart structure><Active Follow-up><Anatomic Sites><Anatomic structures><Anatomy><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Animals><Anti-Arrhythmia Agents><Anti-Arrhythmia Drugs><Anti-Arrhythmics><Area><Arrhythmia><Body Surface><Body Tissues><Cardiac><Cardiac Arrhythmia><Cardiac Diseases><Cardiac Disorders><Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques><Cardiac Electrophysiological Diagnostics><Cardiac ablation><Cardiac infarction><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Diseases><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Catheter Ablation><Cause of Death><Cessation of life><Chronic><Cicatrix><Circulatory Collapse><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Communicating Junction><Complex><Data><Death><Disease><Disorder><Dose><Drug Therapy><Dysfunction><ECG><EKG><Electrocardiogram><Electrocardiography><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Evaluation><Failure><Family suidae><Fibrosis><Follow-Up Studies><Followup Studies><Foundations><Functional disorder><Future><Gap Junctions><Goals><Heart><Heart Arrhythmias><Heart Diseases><Heart Vascular><High Prevalence><Human><Image><Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators><Implantable Defibrillators><Implantation procedure><Incidence><Infarction><LVEF><Left><Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction><Life><Long-term Follow-up><Longterm Follow-up><Low-resistance Junction><MR Imaging><MR Tomography><MRI><MRIs><Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Maps><Measures><Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance><Modern Man><Molecular><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Myocardial Infarct><Myocardial Infarction><NMR Imaging><NMR Tomography><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Nexus Junction><Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Patient Selection><Patients><Pharmacotherapy><Photons><Physiopathology><Pigs><Procedures><Publishing><Radiation><Radiation Dose><Radiation Dose Unit><Radiation therapy><Radiotherapeutics><Radiotherapy><Reaction Time><Recurrence><Recurrent><Refractory><Registries><Resolution><Response RT><Response Time><Risk Reduction><Role><Scars><Series><Shock><Source><Structure><Suidae><Swine><Techniques><Technology><Time><Tissues><United States><Ventricular><Ventricular Arrhythmia><Ventricular End-Diastolic Volumes><Ventricular Fibrillation><Ventricular Tachycardia><Zeugmatography><active followup><arrhythmic agent><cardiac MRI><cardiac electrophysiology><cardiac function><cardiac infarct><cardiac magnetic resonance imaging><cardiovascular disorder><circulatory shock><circulatory system><clinical efficacy><clinical practice><clinical relevance><clinically relevant><compare to control><comparison control><coronary attack><coronary infarct><coronary infarction><drug treatment><electrophysiological><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><function of the heart><heart attack><heart disorder><heart electrophysiology><heart function><heart infarct><heart infarction><imaging><implant placement><implant procedure><improved><infarct><innovate><innovation><innovative><long-term followup><longterm followup><model of animal><mortality><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new therapeutics><new therapy><next generation therapeutics><non-invasive imaging><noninvasive imaging><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><pathophysiology><pig model><piglet model><porcine><porcine model><pre-clinical study><preclinical study><prevent><preventing><programs><psychomotor reaction time><radiation treatment><reduce risk><reduce risks><reduce that risk><reduce the risk><reduce these risks><reduces risk><reduces the risk><reducing risk><reducing the risk><resolutions><response><risk-reducing><shocks><social role><structural cardiac abnormality><structural cardiac anomaly><structural cardiac defect><structural heart condition><structural heart defect><structural heart disease><success><sudden cardiac death><suid><swine model><targeted drug therapy><targeted drug treatments><targeted therapeutic><targeted therapeutic agents><targeted therapy><targeted treatment><treatment with radiation><voltage>",Cardiovascular; Heart Disease
"AutoChamber: an FDA-Designated Breakthrough AI Add-on to Coronary Artery Calcium and Lung Cancer Screening CT Scans to Flag Patients at High Risk of Atrial Fibrillation, Stroke and Heart Failure","AutoChamber: an FDA-Designated Breakthrough AI Add-on to Coronary Artery Calcium and Lung Cancer Screening CT Scans to Flag Patients at High Risk of Atrial Fibrillation, Stroke and Heart Failure","Project Summary/Abstract
AutoChamber is part of an initiative spearheaded by HeartLung.AI, in collaboration with a team of esteemed
physician researchers from leading US academic institutions. The AI tool is designed to opportunistically
screen existing chest CT scans stored in hospital PACS or new scans obtained for any medical evaluations
such as coronary artery calcium scan, lung cancer screening or diagnostic work ups following accidents or
pneumonia and such, to detect asymptomatic enlarged cardiac chambers and thick left ventricular wall without
any X-ray contrast enhanced agent. The human eye cannot distinguish between the inside of cardiac
chambers and the cardiac wall without contrast enhanced agent whereas, the AutoChamber AI which was
trained using contrast-enhanced cardiac CT scans can accurately detect and measure cardiac chambers
volume and left ventricular wall mass. The project underscores a significant stride towards addressing the
unmet needs in early detection and prevention of heart failure and stroke, potentially saving lives, and reducing
healthcare costs. It aligns with the mission of fostering innovative solutions that offer opportunistic diagnoses
using existing CT scans or CT scans obtained for other reasons unrelated to cardiovascular disease. Over 76
million CT scans were performed in the United States in 2019, an estimated 230 CT procedures per 1,000
people with chest CT accounting for 12.7 million that can be used for AutoChamber™ screening.
AutoChamber™ is the newest AI technology that has received a Medical Device Breakthrough Designation
from the FDA as recently as August 30, 2023.
Building upon the encouraging results gleaned from the MESA database, the project aims to extend its
research to the Framingham Heart Study database, the largest prospective cohort study of cardiovascular
diseases with a rich repository of thousands of CT scans to further validate the performance of
AutoChamber™.
The project delineates three specific aims:
Aim 1: To apply AutoChamber™ on CAC scans from the Framingham database and compare the cardiac
chamber volume measurements with those obtained from contrast-enhanced MRI.
Aim 2 To evaluate the performance of AutoChamber™ in predicting incidents of atrial fibrillation and stroke,
benchmarking against existing standards like the CHARGE-AF Score and CHADS-VASc Score.
Aim 3 To assess the capability of AutoChamber™ in detecting prevalent left ventricular hypertrophy and
asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, and predicting incidents of heart failure, using parameters like left
ventricular and left ventricular wall volumetry.","<Accidents><Accounting><Achievement><Achievement Attainment><Active Follow-up><Address><Adoption><Age><Amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide><Apoplexy><Applications Grants><Atrial Fibrillation><Auricular Fibrillation><Benchmarking><Best Practice Analysis><Bone Density><Bone Mineral Density><Brain Vascular Accident><Breakthrough device><Budgets><CAT scan><CT X Ray><CT Xray><CT imaging><CT scan><Calcium><Cardiac><Cardiac Volume><Cardiomegaly><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Diseases><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Cerebral Stroke><Cerebrovascular Apoplexy><Cerebrovascular Stroke><Cohort Studies><Collaborations><Computed Tomography><Computer Software Tools><Concurrent Studies><Consumption><Coronary Disease><Coronary heart disease><Data><Data Bases><Databases><Detection><Devices><Diagnosis><Diagnostic><ECG><EKG><Early Diagnosis><Echocardiogram><Echocardiography><Electrocardiogram><Electrocardiography><Enlarged Heart><Equation><Evaluation><Event><Eye><Eyeball><Fostering><Framingham Heart Study><Funding><Future><Glean><Grant><Grant Proposals><Greenland><Health Care Costs><Health Costs><Healthcare><Healthcare Costs><Heart Enlargement><Heart Vascular><Heart Volume><Heart failure><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Hospitals><Human><Individual><Institution><Investigation><Investigators><Journals><Kalaallit Nunaat><LV Mass><Left><Left Atrium><Left Ventricles><Left Ventricular Dysfunction><Left Ventricular Hypertrophy><Left Ventricular Mass><Left atrial structure><Left ventricular structure><Legal patent><Letters><Licensing><Life><MR Imaging><MR Tomography><MRI><MRIs><Magazine><Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Manuscripts><Marketing><Measurement><Measures><Medical><Medical Device><Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance><Medicine><Methods><Mission><Modern Man><Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis><N-BNP peptide><N-terminal pro-BNP><NIH><NMR Imaging><NMR Tomography><NT-BNP><NT-proBNP><National Institutes of Health><New England><Northeastern United States><Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Osteoporosis><Patents><Patients><Performance><Persons><Physicians><Pneumonia><Population><Position><Positioning Attribute><Prevention><Procedures><Prospective Studies><Prospective, cohort study><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Right Atrium><Right Ventricles><Right atrial structure><Right ventricular structure><Risk><Risk Assessment><Roentgen Rays><Running><SBIR><Scanning><Secure><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Software Tools><Stroke><Technology><Testing><Thick><Thickness><Tomodensitometry><Training><Transthoracic Echocardiography><United States><United States National Institutes of Health><Ventricular><Woman><Work><X-Radiation><X-Ray CAT Scan><X-Ray Computed Tomography><X-Ray Computerized Tomography><X-Ray Radiation><X-ray><Xray><Xray CAT scan><Xray Computed Tomography><Xray computerized tomography><Zeugmatography><active followup><ages><atherosclerotic heart disease><benchmark><brain attack><cardiac MRI><cardiac failure><cardiac imaging><cardiac magnetic resonance imaging><cardiac scanning><cardiovascular disease risk><cardiovascular disorder><cardiovascular disorder risk><catscan><cerebral vascular accident><cerebrovascular accident><chest CT><chest computed tomography><circulatory system><commercialization><comparative><computed axial tomography><computer tomography><computerized axial tomography><computerized tomography><contrast enhanced><coronary artery calcium><coronary artery calcium scoring><coronary calcium><coronary calcium scoring><coronary disorder><cost><data base><deep learning><deep learning method><deep learning strategy><depository><design><designing><early detection><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><health care><heart failure and reduced ejection fraction><heart failure with reduced ejection fraction><heart imaging><heart scanning><heart sonography><high risk><high risk group><high risk individual><high risk people><high risk population><innovate><innovation><innovative><intracardiac volume><left ventricle abnormality><lung cancer early detection><lung cancer screening><non-contrast CT><noncontrast CT><noncontrast computed tomography><preservation><pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76)><proBNP(1-76)><prospective><repository><screening><screenings><software toolkit><standard of care><stroked><strokes><success><tool>",Aging; Atherosclerosis; Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Brain Disorders; Cancer; Cardiovascular; Cerebrovascular; Clinical Research; Health Services; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease; Lung; Lung Cancer; Osteoporosis; Prevention; Stroke
Lrp5 and Lrp6 signaling in bone mechanotransduction and metabolism,Lrp5 and Lrp6 signaling in bone mechanotransduction and metabolism,"The search for molecular targets and pathways that can be manipulated to improve bone properties is a highly
active area of investigation. Recently, particular interest has been expressed in targeting biomolecules that can
augment mechanical signaling in bone; the next generation of osteoporosis drugs is likely to work in conjunction
with physical activity/loading in order to disproportionately direct new bone formation to the skeletal loci that need
it most (i.e., those loci that endure the greatest strains and are at the greatest risk of failure). The WNT signaling
pathway has emerged as a key regulator of bone mass and strength, but also of bone cell mechanotransduction.
Recent clinical approval of the osteoporosis therapy Evenity™ (i.e., Romosozumab-aqqg) has highlighted the utility
and potency of targeting the WNT pathway to improve skeletal properties and fracture resistance. However, the
FDA issued a black-box label to the product because of its side effects on cardiovascular function and health. Recent
work suggests that the effects of WNT stimulation on bone formation can be isolated from those on cardiovascular
function, but the molecular mechanisms driving these disparate processes are completely unknown. The
goal of the present is application is to understand precisely how LRP5 and LRP6--two structurally related cell surface
proteins that function as WNT co-receptors--differ in their skeletal and non-skeletal contexts, with the goal of
exploiting signaling differences to improve clinically based WNT therapeutic outcomes (e.g., sclerostin inhibition).
Among the key questions addressed are: (1) Do LRP5 and LRP6 exhibit different predilection, or selectivity, to different
WNT ligands in bone cells in vivo? (2) Does LRP5 activation trigger different downstream signaling networks
than activated LRP6? (3) Is LRP6 involved in mechanotransduction in bone (overuse and/or disuse)? (4)
Can activation of LRP5 alone (through sclerostin antibody-mediated inhibition or by gain-of-function mutation in
the receptor) improve bone properties to a greater extent than activation of LRP6 alone? and (5) Are cardiovascular
effects differentially affected by LRP5 vs LRP6 signaling (in isolation)? We will use cutting-edge mouse models,
microscopic techniques, single cell and spatial transcriptomic approaches, mechanotransduction models, and radiographic/
histologic/biochemical approaches to reveal the underlying biology and therapeutic potential/differences
of LRP5 and LRP6 in bone tissue. The project is a continuation of the close collaboration between the Robling
(Indiana University) and Warman (Harvard University) labs, an extremely fruitful partnership for more than 18 yrs.
We have assembled a unique combination of expertise, resources, biological models and tools, and technical innovation
to elucidate, distinguish, and exploit the differing roles of LRP5 and LRP6 in bone biology and disease.

Effectiveness of Therapies for Heart Failure with Mid-Range Ejection Fraction,Effectiveness of Therapies for Heart Failure with Mid-Range Ejection Fraction,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Evidence from trials has established that 4 separate classes of guideline-directed medical therapies
(GDMT) for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) together reduce mortality by nearly two-thirds.
Conversely, for heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF), trials have produced only weaker
evidence, resulting in ambiguous guidelines. Our long-term goal is to build the largest echocardiography
registry in the world to generate comparative effectiveness evidence for questions for specific populations in
heart failure where trials have not been able to provide strong evidence. The overall objectives in this
application are to build the registry, test mathematical assumptions required for the application of strong causal
inference methods developed in economics, and then apply the strongest methods possible to measure
treatment effects for GDMT in HFmrEF. The central hypothesis is that “real-world” treatment decisions will
differ at guideline-suggested thresholds of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and patients on either side
of those immediate LVEF thresholds will be otherwise similar (“as good as random”), allowing the application of
regression discontinuity methods to measure treatment effects. We believe these methods will demonstrate
reduced mortality with GDMT for patients with HFmrEF. The rationale for this proposal is that (1) LVEF cutoffs
in guidelines are semi-arbitrary in the sense that LVEF exists on a physiological continuum but guideline
cutoffs are based on strict thresholds, and (2) our preliminary data demonstrates expected discontinuities in
treatment frequency at influential LVEF thresholds for other HF therapies (defibrillators) in real-world practice.
As such, the conditions for “as good as random” likely exist in small ranges around relevant LVEF thresholds,
allowing the application of regression discontinuity methods. Our central hypothesis will be tested with 2
specific aims. In Aim #1, we will use natural language processing to aggregate data from echocardiography
reports from 11 hospitals creating the largest echocardiography registry in the world, allowing clinical
adjudication of both clinical information and echocardiographic images. We will then systematically test
mathematical assumptions required for regression discontinuity. In Aim #2, we will create robust estimates of
each of the effects of each GDMT medication class on mortality in HFmrEF with fuzzy RDD and alternative
methods, including propensity score methods. The feasibility of propensity score methods does not depend on
the Aim 1 analyses, so at least 1 of the 2 proposed methods will be feasible. We therefore expect that these
results will upgrade evidence from the current class 2b (“usefulness is unknown”) in heart failure guidelines for
3 of the 4 GDMT medication classes. We think the proposed research is innovative because it combines
strong causal inference methods to observational data with the adjudication standards of trials to fill in
unanswered gaps in evidence. The research proposed here is significant because it will upgrade the current
ambiguous treatment guidelines for HFmrEF in ways that will reduce mortality for this growing population.","<ACE Inhibitors><Address><Adrenergic beta-Antagonists><Adrenergic beta-Blockers><Aggregated Data><Aldosterone Receptor><Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors><Angiotensin Receptor><Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Antagonists><Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors><Angiotensins><CD10 Antigens><Cardiac Diseases><Cardiac Disorders><Clinical><Clinical Data><Clinical Practice Guideline><Co-Transporters><Community Hospitals><Comparative Effectiveness Research><D-Glucose><Data><Data Aggregation><Defibrillators><Dextrose><Drugs><EFRAC><Echocardiogram><Echocardiography><Economics><Effectiveness><Ejection Fraction><Electric Shock Cardiac Stimulators><Enkephalinase><Ensure><Frequencies><Future><Glucose><Goals><Guidelines><Health><Heart Diseases><Heart failure><Hospitals><Image><Individual><Influentials><Kininase II Antagonists><Kininase II Inhibitors><LVEF><Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction><Link><Manuals><Math><Mathematics><Measurement><Measures><Medical><Medication><Membrane Metalloendopeptidase><Methods><Mineralocorticoid Receptor><Mission><NHLBI><Na element><National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute><Natural Language Processing><Needs Assessment><Neprilysin><Neutral Endopeptidase><Observation research><Observation study><Observational Study><Observational research><Outcome><Patients><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phenotype><Physiologic><Physiological><Population><Primary Prevention><Public Health><Recommendation><Registries><Reporting><Research><Research Resources><Resources><Scoring Method><Side><Sodium><Stimulators, Electrical, Cardiac, Shock><Structure><Subgroup><Testing><Therapy trial><Transthoracic Echocardiography><Treatment Failure><United States><Work><adjudication><adjudicative process and procedure><antagonism><antagonist><beta blocker><beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents><beta-Adrenergic Receptor Blockaders><cardiac failure><clinical practice and guidelines><co-morbid><co-morbidity><comorbidity><comparative effectiveness><drug/agent><economic><heart disorder><heart failure and reduced ejection fraction><heart failure with reduced ejection fraction><heart sonography><imaging><improved><inhibitor><innovate><innovation><innovative><mortality><multi-modality><multimodality><natural language understanding><novel><prospective><symporter><therapy failure><tool><treatment effect><treatment guidelines><treatment strategy>",Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Health Services; Heart Disease
An epidemiological study to investigate the multifactoral nature of diabetes risk among adults with COVID-19 with a genetic and social determinants of health lens,An epidemiological study to investigate the multifactoral nature of diabetes risk among adults with COVID-19 with a genetic and social determinants of health lens,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal seeks to enhance our understanding of new-onset diabetes in individuals with COVID-19 by
exploring social determinants of health and underlying biology. Both diabetes and COVID-19 disproportionately
affect individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups. Further, these individuals experience worse clinical
outcomes, including higher rates of mortality compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Some have suggested these
observations may be due to differences in comorbidities, home/work environment, or access to care. This study
will investigate the 1) prevalence of new-onset diabetes in COVID-19; 2) how social determinants of health
influence health outcomes; and 3) the genetic likelihood of developing diabetes. Study results will not only help
identify high risk populations, but will also contribute to enhancing health equity, reducing disparities, and
promoting better health outcomes. The proposed work will use quantitative methods to address the question.
We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the true prevalence of new-onset diabetes
in individuals diagnosed with COVID-19. Additionally, we will use prospective survey data from the All of Us
database to determine salient factors related to social determinants of health and health outcomes. Last, we will
use the All of Us database to conduct genome-wide-association studies and calculate the risk score for diabetes
and COVID-19 to examine underlying biologic risk of developing new-onset diabetes. The training plan for this
fellowship includes a variety of opportunities to develop and apply knowledge in social determinants of health
and analytic skills as well as professional development activities aimed at nurturing a well-rounded nurse
scientist. Training opportunities include structured and experiential learning activities to develop substantive and
methodological knowledge. Interdisciplinary team-based research experiences and mentorship will complement
formal and experiential learning opportunities. A strong mentoring team has been assembled with
complementary experts in endocrinology/diabetes, social determinants of health, and statistical analysis. The
proposed study and study sponsors are supported by the institutional environment of Boston College Connell
School of Nursing which has significant resources to support the proposed project. The mentoring team and
institutional environment are well-suited for the successful completion of the proposed project and training plan
for this fellowship. This study addresses the NINR’s research lens of advancing health equity and social
determinants of health research. The proposed work will elucidate the intersection of social and environmental
factors with biologic risk factors and their impact on health outcomes. Findings will inform a holistic approach to
understanding health disparities and advancing health equity among racial and ethnic minorities affected by
diabetes and COVID-19",<2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel coronavirus><2019-nCoV><21+ years old><ARDS><Access to Care><Active Learning><Acute><Acute Respiratory Distress><Acute Respiratory Distress

Contributions of pulmonary arterial and venous remodeling to HFpEF in the elderly,Contributions of pulmonary arterial and venous remodeling to HFpEF in the elderly,"Heart failure (HF) disproportionately affects the elderly who predominantly develop HF with preserved left
ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (HFpEF), for which no efficacious therapies exist. Pulmonary hypertension
(PH) – the most clinically recognized expression of pulmonary vascular dysfunction (PVD) – is a risk factor for
incident HF and is present in upto 83% of patients with prevalent HFpEF, among whom it portends worse
outcomes. PVD is therefore an attractive therapeutic target in HFpEF, but its pathophysiology is complex with
variable contributions from elevated left atrial pressure, pulmonary parenchymal injury, and intrinsic
pulmonary vascular dysfunction. A critical barrier to understanding PVD in HFpEF is a lack of knowledge
regarding the anatomic alterations in the pulmonary vasculature underlying abnormal hemodynamics. The
investigative team has pioneered development and validation of advanced image processing pipelines to
quantify pulmonary venous and arterial remodeling on non-contrast chest computerized tomography (CT)
scans. Their published and preliminary data from smokers in the NHLBI-funded COPDGene study show that
pulmonary vascular remodeling associates with RV dysfunction and worse functional capacity, and is more
frequently observed in HF. They now propose to extend these findings to a community-based cohort of older
adults to define the role of pulmonary vascular remodeling in the development of HFpEF. This proposal’s
central hypothesis is that activation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways promotes pulmonary
vascular remodeling, partially via concomitant LV dysfunction and pulmonary parenchymal injury, leading to
PH, RV dysfunction, and ultimately HF. This project will leverage recently completed chest CT (for CAC) and
echocardiography in 1,579 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study participants at the 7th study visit
(2/2018-11/2019; age ~81±4 yrs). Novel CT-based measures of pulmonary vascular remodeling and
parenchymal injury (fibrotic, emphysematous), and advanced 3D and strain-based echo measures of RV
function will be performed. These data will be integrated with clinical assessments, outcomes surveillance,
aptamer-based proteomics, and genomics to help define the most relevant targets to prevent progressive PVD
in the very elderly. Specific aims include: (1) Define the extent to which LV dysfunction and pulmonary
parenchymal injury promote pulmonary venous and arterial remodeling in the very elderly; (2) Determine the
extent to which pulmonary vascular remodeling predicts RV dysfunction, reduced functional capacity, and
incident HFpEF; and (3) Identify proteins and protein networks that predict pulmonary vascular remodeling.
Replication will occur in COPDGene and the Framingham Heart Study, and Mendelian randomization analyses
will identify the subset of potentially causal associations. Quantifying pulmonary vascular remodeling will
identify pathophysiologically distinct morphologic PVD sub-phenotypes enabling more precise application of
existing therapies, while discovery of associated molecular pathways may inform novel therapeutic targets.","<3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><Activities of Daily Living><Activities of everyday life><Affect><Age><Anatomic Sites><Anatomic structures><Anatomy><Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities><Atrial><Blood Vessels><Blood Volume><Bone-Derived Transforming Growth Factor><CAT scan><CT X Ray><CT Xray><CT imaging><CT scan><Cardiac><Cardiac Atrium><Cardiopulmonary><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Chest><Clinical><Clinical assessments><Communities><Complex><Computed Tomography><Data><Development><Dysfunction><EFRAC><Echocardiogram><Echocardiography><Ejection Fraction><Elderly><Emphysema><Fibrosis><Fibrotic lesions in lung><Framingham Heart Study><Functional disorder><Funding><Genomics><Goals><Heart><Heart Atrium><Heart Vascular><Heart failure><Image><Individual><Inflammatory><Injury><Knowledge><LVEF><Left><Left Ventricular Dysfunction><Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Lung damage><Lung scar><Lung tissue scar><Measurable><Measures><Mendelian randomization><Milk Growth Factor><Molecular><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Morphology><NHLBI><National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute><Outcome><Participant><Pathway interactions><Patients><Phenotype><Physiopathology><Platelet Transforming Growth Factor><Proteins><Proteomics><Publishing><Pulmonary Emphysema><Pulmonary Hypertension><Pulmonary Scar><Pulmonary Tissue fibrosis><Pump><Resistance><Risk><Risk Factors><Role><Scanning><Scarring at the lung><Scarring in the lung><Signal Pathway><Smoker><Spirometry><Structure><System><TGF B><TGF-beta><TGF-β><TGFbeta><TGFβ><Techniques><Testing><Therapeutic><Thorace><Thoracic><Thorax><Tomodensitometry><Transforming Growth Factor beta><Transforming Growth Factor-Beta Family Gene><Transthoracic Echocardiography><Validation><Venous><Visit><Walking><X-Ray CAT Scan><X-Ray Computed Tomography><X-Ray Computerized Tomography><Xray CAT scan><Xray Computed Tomography><Xray computerized tomography><advanced age><adverse consequence><adverse outcome><age associated><age correlated><age dependent><age linked><age related><age specific><ages><aptamer><arterial remodeling><atrium><bi-racial><biracial><cardiac failure><catscan><circulatory system><cohort><computed axial tomography><computer tomography><computerized axial tomography><computerized tomography><cost><daily living function><daily living functionality><decline in function><decline in functional status><defined contribution><developmental><effective therapy><effective treatment><efficacious therapy><efficacious treatment><emphysematous><fibrotic lung><functional ability><functional capacity><functional decline><functional status decline><genomic data><genomic data-set><genomic dataset><geriatric><heart sonography><hemodynamics><image processing><imaging><impaired pulmonary vascularization><injuries><innovate><innovation><innovative><late life><left ventricle abnormality><lung injury><lung pressure><lung vascular disease><lung vascular remodeling><mortality><new drug target><new druggable target><new pharmacotherapy target><new therapeutic target><new therapy target><non-contrast CT><non-invasive imaging><noncontrast CT><noncontrast computed tomography><noninvasive imaging><novel><novel drug target><novel druggable target><novel pharmacotherapy target><novel therapeutic target><novel therapy target><older adult><older adulthood><pathophysiology><pathway><preservation><pressure><prevent><preventing><pulmonary><pulmonary damage><pulmonary injury><pulmonary pressure><pulmonary tissue damage><pulmonary tissue injury><pulmonary vascular disease><pulmonary vascular disorder><pulmonary vascular dysfunction><pulmonary vascular remodeling><pulmonary vasculopathy><resistant><senior citizen><social role><systemic inflammation><systemic inflammatory response><therapeutic target><three dimensional><validations><vascular>",Aging; Biomedical Imaging; Biotechnology; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Heart Disease; Lung; Prevention; Pulmonary Hypertension
Role of SuPAR in the Intersection between Cardiovascular and Kidney Disease,Role of SuPAR in the Intersection between Cardiovascular and Kidney Disease,"Project Summary
People with chronic kidney disease (CKD), who represent over 15% of the population of the United States,
suffer a disproportionately high burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for reasons that are poorly
understood. Inflammation represents the major pathophysiologic process common to both atherosclerosis and
CKD. Recently, a novel pathway of inflammation was uncovered linking both CVD and CKD to bone marrow
myeloid cells which produce a circulating signaling molecule: soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor
(suPAR). SuPAR is released by immature myeloid cells in response to environmental exposures and CVD risk
factors. In circulation, suPAR alters glomerular and tubular function, with chronic exposure leading to
progressive kidney dysfunction. Pharmacologic inhibition of suPAR in experimental models prevented kidney
injury. SuPAR levels also predict adverse cardiovascular outcomes independently of kidney function, and
outperform well-established markers of CVD risk, such as coronary calcium, C-reactive protein, high sensitivity
troponin I and B-type natriuretic peptide. These compelling data reveal the potential for suPAR not only as an
excellent biomarker of risk, but also as a promising therapeutic target. The role of suPAR in CVD is however
poorly understood. The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate suPAR’s potential causal role in the
progression of atherosclerosis and its link to decline in kidney function through epidemiologic insights. We will
achieve this goal by leveraging three of the most significant contributions to cardiovascular science: the
landmark Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA); an NIH-funded prospective cohort in which enrollees
underwent serial measurements of subclinical markers of atherosclerosis, the JUPITER trial, in which
participants with high C-reactive protein levels were randomized to statin or placebo, and the UK Biobank, a
data repository of over 500,000 volunteers. SuPAR levels will be measured in 5,620 participants of MESA to
determine whether levels correlate with early markers of CVD and predicts their progression independently of a
decline in kidney function. To assess potential causality, a gene-wide association study of suPAR levels in
MESA, followed by a Mendelian randomization analysis in the UK Biobank dataset will connect genetic
determinants of suPAR levels to CVD and CKD. Lastly, to establish whether suPAR is a modifiable risk factor
for CVD, levels will be measured serially in participants of the JUPITER trial randomized to rosuvastatin
(n=200) or placebo (n=200), and the change in suPAR will be compared between groups. Whether the benefits
of statins are dependent on suPAR levels will be assessed in the MESA cohort by comparing the survival of
participants started on statins across suPAR quartiles, and determining whether suPAR is a modifier of the
association between statins and outcomes. The proposed research has the potential to address the unmet
need of close to 50 million people with CKD in the United States alone, identifying sorely needed therapeutic
targets and management strategies in a field that has long been stagnant.","<Acceleration><Active Follow-up><Address><Arterial Fatty Streak><Arterial Fatty

ELECTROMECHANICAL COUPLING AND DISEASE MECHANISMS OF MYOCARDIAL CNBD FAMILY CHANNELS,ELECTROMECHANICAL COUPLING AND DISEASE MECHANISMS OF MYOCARDIAL CNBD FAMILY CHANNELS,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The CNBD family of channels, encompassing hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) and
depolarization-activated KCNH members, plays a pivotal role in shaping the electrical properties of the heart.
The modulation of HCN channels presents a promising therapeutic avenue for the management of atrial and
ventricular arrhythmias by influencing the activity of the sinoatrial node pacemaker. In addition, the human
KCNH2 potassium channel (hERG) gene is linked to long QT syndrome (LQTS), an inherited cardiac condition
that substantially escalates the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. HCN and KCNH
channels share structural features, most notably their voltage-sensing domains (VSD). However, they display
divergent channel gating behaviors. Up to this point, a comprehensive mechanism that adequately explains the
diversity in their voltage-dependent gating has remained elusive. In particular, the VSD of HCN channels
undergoes distinct conformational changes during activation, whose dynamics, nature of intermediate
conformational states, and couplings to other domains remain largely uncharacterized. Moreover, like mutations
affecting the VSD of HCN channels, we recently uncovered that several LQTS-linked mutations the S4 helix
voltage sensor of hERG channels lead to distinctively altered voltage-dependent activation profiles. The
underlying mechanism of these disease-causing gating alterations remains unexplored, yet it is central to our
understanding of the mechanism of cardiac diseases related to CNBD channels. The overarching objective of
this application is to determine the VSD dynamics of recombinant CNBD channels expressed in human cell lines,
using an array of concerted biophysical techniques. We will improve the patch-clamp fluorometry (PCF) method
to study the structure-function correlation of cardiac voltage-gated channels, paving the way to new treatments
of myocardial diseases. Our primary goals also include studying how pivotal regulatory domains modulate
channel gating by altering VSD conformations. To quantitatively assess voltage-dependent structural
rearrangements, we will leverage transition metal ion Förster resonance energy transfer (tmFRET), noncanonical
amino acid integration, and click chemistry for site-specific fluorescence labeling. This strategy will enable us to
precisely translate FRET efficiencies into interatomic distances. In parallel, phasor-plot fluorescence lifetime
imaging (FLIM) in conjunction with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations will be used to quantify the underlying
structural dynamics. Collectively, the proposed studies will delineate the energetics, allostery, and structural
foundations of cardiac pacemaking ion channels.",<Action Potentials><Address><Affect><Amino Acids><Arrhythmia><Asystole><Atrial><Atrial Fibrillation><Attention><Auricular Fibrillation><Behavior><Binding><Bypass><CNG channel (rod)><Cardiac><Cardiac Arrest><Cardiac Arrhythmia><Cardiac Atrium><Cardiac Diseases><Cardiac Disorders><Cardiomyopathies><Cations><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Characteristics><Chemistry><Coupling><Cyclic Nucleotides><Disease><Disorder><ECG><EKG><Electrocardiogram><Electrocardiography><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Ethers><Exhibits><FLIM imaging><FRET><Family><Fluorescence><Fluorescence Anisotropy><Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer><Fluorometry><Foundations><Frequencies><Förster Resonance Energy Transfer><Genes><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic defect><Goals><H-bond><Heart><Heart Arrest><Heart Arrhythmias><Heart Atrium><Heart Diseases><Heart failure><Hereditary><Heterogeneity><Homo><Human><Human Cell Line><Hydrogen Bonding><Inherited><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Ion Channel><Ion Channel Gating><Ion Channel Gatings><Ionic Channels><Ions><K channel><Kinetics><Knowledge><Label><Lead><Link><Long QT Syndrome><Measurement><Measures><Mediating><Membrane><Membrane Channels><Methodology><Methods><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular Computations><Molecular Configuration><Molecular Conformation><Molecular Dynamics Simulation><Molecular Interaction><Molecular Stereochemistry><Movement><Mutation><Myocardial><Myocardial Diseases><Myocardial Disorder><Myocardiopathies><Nature><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Pace Stimulators><Pacemakers><Pb element><Phase><Physiology><Play><Potassium Channel><Potassium Ion Channels><Process><Recombinants><Risk><Role><S-A Node><Shapes><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Sino-Atrial Node><Sinoatrial Node><Sinu-Atrial Node><Sinuatrial Node><Site><Structure><Syndrome><Techniques><Testing><Therapeutic><Time><Transition Elements><Translating><Ventricular Arrhythmia><aminoacid><atrium><biological signal transduction><biophysical approaches><biophysical methodology><biophysical methods><biophysical techniques><body movement><cardiac failure><cardiac rhythm><cationic channel protein (rod)><comparative><conformation><conformational><conformational state><conformationally><conformations><cyclic-nucleotide gated channel><cyclic-nucleotide gated ion channels><delayed rectifier potassium channel><delayed rectifying potassium channel><electrical property><electrophysiological><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><fluorescence imaging><fluorescence life-time imaging><fluorescence life-time imaging microscopy><fluorescence lifetime imaging><fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy><fluorescent imaging><genome mutation><heart disorder><heart rhythm><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><image-based method><imaging approach><imaging based approach><imaging method><imaging modality><improved><insight><member><membrane structure><molecular dynamics><myocardium disease><myocardium disorder><patch clamp><sensor><sinus node><social role><sudden cardiac death><transition metal><voltage><voltage gated channel>,Cardiovascular; Heart Disease
Proactive Dual-Irrigation Cardiac Chest Tube to Maintain Postoperative Patency,Proactive Dual-Irrigation Cardiac Chest Tube to Maintain Postoperative Patency,"Abstract
Over 455k cardiac procedures annually rely on chest tubes to drain blood from surgical wounds. However, dated
chest drainage technologies result in significant issues—36% of tubes clog with blood, leading to complications
in 17% of patients due to incomplete drainage. Hospitals spend approximately $9,617 per patient on these
complications, totaling a yearly economic burden surpassing $2B in the US alone. The current practice of milking
and stripping chest tubes is both labor-intensive and potentially risky, often leading to missed clots that
compromise tube patency and patient adverse outcomes.
CirculaTech’s ThoraFlush is a proactive clot preventing chest tube which utilizes proprietary dual irrigation
technology to sustain drainage patency. ThoraFlush integrates seamlessly with hospital IV pumps to irrigate the
chest tube with saline, obviating the labor-intensive manual manipulation, and automating chest tube
maintenance. ThoraFlush saves nurses time and effort in maintaining chest tubes, reduces hospital costs linked
to tube blockages, and promotes faster, smoother patient recovery with fewer complications.
This NIH proposal will complete the following AIMs: 1) Optimize ThoraFlush’s efficacy of drainage patency in a
mediastinum blood coagulation model (MBCM). 2) Sustaining ThoraFlush’s drainage volume in an in vivo model,
superior than the standard of care.
In AIM 1, the team will use an in vitro bench top mediastinum blood coagulation model, known as the MBCM to
produce a functioning ThoraFlush prototype. The MBCM is hypothesized to be more rigorous than clinical
practice due to its use of hypercoagulable porcine blood and mediastinal model geometries/materials promoting
accelerated blood clot formation. Achieving a 6 hour benchmark of retaining device patency will prove
significance to move to conducting AIM 2.
In AIM 2, the team will translate their work in Aim 1 to animal testing using male Yorkshire Breed pigs to assess
ThoraFlush's efficacy in live animals. The study involves a simulated heart surgery, replicating common cardiac
procedures. This approach aims to comprehensively evaluate ThoraFlush's performance in a relevant
physiological context. This model also proves as a first of its kind, mediastinum in vivo model for post-surgical
recovery.
Ultimately, the outcomes of this proposal will develop and prove that ThoraFlush meets patency requirements in
the MBCM and show’s superior performance in an in vivo study, promoting its next stages into commercialization
of the device.",<Acceleration><Address><Air><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Animal Testing><Animals><Aortocoronary Bypass><Arteries><Atrial Fibrillation><Auricular Fibrillation><Benchmarking><Best Practice Analysis><Blood><Blood Circulation><Blood Clotting><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Blood coagulation><Blood flow><Bloodstream><Breeding><Cardiac><Cardiac Surgery><Cardiac Surgery procedures><Cardiac Tamponade><Caring><Catheters><Chest><Chest Tubes><Clotting><Coagulation><Coagulation Process><Coronary Artery Bypass><Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting><Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery><Coronary arterial bypass><Data><Device Designs><Devices><Drainage><Drainage procedure><Economic Burden><Effectiveness><Exhibits><Failure><Family suidae><Female><Freezing><Geometry><Heart Surgical Procedures><Hemostasis><Hemostatic function><Hospital Costs><Hospitalization cost><Hospitals><Hour><Hypercoagulability><In Vitro><Infusion><Infusion procedures><Investigators><Irrigation><Label><Legal patent><Link><Location><Maintenance><Manuals><Measures><Mediastinal><Mediastinum><Medical Device><Methods><Milk><Modeling><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Nurses><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Outcome><Patents><Patients><Performance><Phase><Physiologic><Physiological><Pigs><Pleural Effusion><Pleural effusion disorder><Post-Operative><Postoperative><Postoperative Period><Preparation><Procedures><Pump><Recovery><Reporting><Research Personnel><Researchers><Rose's tamponade><STRNTY><Saline><Saline Solution><Sternotomy><Suidae><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><Surgical wound><Swine><Syndrome><Technology><Testing><Thorace><Thoracic><Thorax><Thrombophilia><Time><Translating><Tube><United States National Institutes of Health><Veins><Visual><Work><adverse consequence><adverse outcome><air filter><benchmark><clinical practice><commercialization><coronary bypass><design><designing><full scale manufacturing><heart surgery><heart tamponade><human study><improved><in vivo><in vivo Model><infusions><innovate><innovation><innovative><interest><irrigation therapy><large scale manufacturing><large scale production><male><manufacture><mass production><model of animal><nurse><pig model><piglet model><pleural cavity effusion><porcine><porcine model><preparations><prevent><preventing><prototype><response><standard of care><success><suid><surgery><swine model><tech development><technology development><tissue wound><wound><wounding><wounds>,Bioengineering; Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Hematology; Wound Healing and Care
Dead Space and Inhaled Nitric Oxide in Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,Dead Space and Inhaled Nitric Oxide in Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mortality remains high (20%) for the 8,000 US children each year that develop pediatric acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS). No pharmacologic therapies have been identified that decrease the mortality risk
from ARDS. This is likely due to underlying biologic heterogeneity among patients with ARDS that may result in
some benefiting from a therapy whereas others are harmed, limiting the ability to find effective therapies in
clinical trials of general cohorts. Inflammatory phenotypes have been described in ARDS that may help identify
underlying biologic differences contributing to heterogeneity in treatment effect. However, these phenotypes
cannot currently be identified in real-time. There is an urgent need for easily available markers to identify
clinically relevant heterogeneity in patients with ARDS. Markers of dead space may be promising for this
purpose. Dead space is area of the lung that receive ventilation without perfusion and reflects abnormal
pulmonary perfusion (microvascular dysfunction, low cardiac output) and alveolar overdistension. With routine
patient monitoring data (time-based capnography, blood gases), dead space can be estimated with the end
tidal alveolar dead space fraction (AVDSf). We have found in single-center studies that AVDSf is more strongly
associated with mortality risk than are markers of the severity of hypoxemia (oxygenation index [OI]) in early
pediatric ARDS. Dead space may also be an attractive marker for identifying heterogeneity of treatment effect
for therapies such as inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) that target pulmonary perfusion. iNO is a selective pulmonary
vasodilator, with additional anti-inflammatory and anticoagulation effects, that is commonly used off-label for
refractory hypoxemia in ARDS. But almost all clinical trials of iNO therapy have failed to demonstrate a benefit
when enrolling general cohorts of patients or selecting patients based on severity of hypoxemia. One small
pediatric trial found higher extracorporeal membrane oxygenation free survival suggesting the potential for
some subgroups to benefit from iNO therapy. Our preliminary data suggest that iNO therapy decreases the
AVDSf associated mortality risk and that a decline in AVDSf with iNO therapy is associated with improving
plasma markers of microvascular dysfunction. Our central hypotheses are that the routinely available AVDSf is
more strongly tied to mortality risk than OI and that AVDSf is an important marker of heterogeneity in the iNO
treatment effect in patients with ARDS. These hypotheses will be tested through the following Specific Aims:
1) validate AVDSf for risk stratification of mortality in pediatric ARDS 2) determine if there is heterogeneity in
treatment effect for iNO defined by AVDSf, and 3) detect the association between AVDSf and microvascular
dysfunction trajectory and whether iNO therapy modifies the association. Demonstrating that AVDSf

"Slippery, Omniphobic Coating to Prevent Thrombosis and Biofilm Formation on Peripheral Vascular Grafts","Slippery, Omniphobic Coating to Prevent Thrombosis and Biofilm Formation on Peripheral Vascular Grafts","PROJECT SUMMARY
Critical limb ischemia (CLI) affects 2 million Americans with peripheral artery disease (PAD) each year and is a
frequent cause of persistent ulcers and wounds, amputations, hospitalizations with frequent re-admissions, and
death due to reduced blood flow to the affected limb. Untreated, CLI patients survive under 2 years. The main
treatment for CLI is to increase blood flow to improve limb perfusion using extremity artery bypass. When the
patient’s own vein is insufficient peripheral vascular grafts (PVG), frequently made from expanded
polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), are used as a synthetic graft is used for both segments. Unfortunately, PVG
have failure rates ranging from 20% to 50% within the first year of surgery, which increases to >60% after 5
years. The primary reasons for PVG failure are neointimal hyperplasia, occlusion via thrombosis, and infection.
No current or in-development technology successfully addresses these challenges.
FreeFlow Medical Devices (FFMD) is aiming to optimize and commercialize tethered liquid perfluorocarbon
(TLP) coatings on medical devices. Our TLP coating stops the adhesion of all biological components (bacteria,
fungi, blood components) to the surface of medical devices by immobilizing a thin layer of highly inert and
biocompatible perfluorinated liquid. Our preliminary data demonstrate that our TLP coating effectively resists
occlusion and pathogen colonization on vascular devices under physiological flow conditions.
In this Fast Track proposal, we will investigate the ability of TLP PVG to resist occlusion, thrombus formation,
and biofilm formation, which all contribute to graft dysfunction We will also finalize the TLP additive packaging
for GMP manufacturing in Phase II. This will be achieved using six Aims. Phase 1 Aim 1. Perform a 90-day in
vitro TLP PVG characterization to understand the durability and characteristics of the coating after 90 days.
Phase 1 Aim 2. Perform a 60-day protein biofouling study to test the ability of TLP surfaces to resist protein
adsorption since biofilm development, thrombus progression, and neointimal hyperplasia all begin with protein
adsorption. Phase 1 Aim 3. Perform 30-day in vitro thrombogenicity testing. Phase 2 Aim 4. Obtain GMP-
manufactured TLP PVG. Phase 2 Aim 5. Perform an efficacy study to compare the in vivo effectiveness of TLP
PVG with standard PVG (BD Impra®) at reducing thrombin formation, neointimal hypoplasia, and stenosis.
Phase 2 Aim 6. Initiate the 510(k) application process to obtain FDA premarketing approval and perform a
biocompatibility study. These advances will allow FFMD to maximize the effectiveness of the TLP coating and
dramatically improve PVG patient care by reducing graft failure dure to neointimal hyperplasia, infection, and
thrombosis.","<Acute><Address><Adhesions><Adsorption><Affect><Albumins><American><Amputation><Anticoagulation><Area><Arteries><Bacteria><Binding Proteins><Biological><Blood><Blood Coagulation Factor I><Blood Coagulation Factor One><Blood Factor One><Blood Plasma><Blood Proteins><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Blood Vessel Prosthesis><Blood Vessels><Blood flow><Buffers><Bypass><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Cavia><Cell Attachment><Cell Death Induction><Cell-Matrix Adhesions><Cell-Matrix Junction><Cessation of life><Characteristics><Clotting><Coagulation><Coagulation Factor I><Coagulation Factor One><Coagulation Process><Data><Death><Development><Devices><Effectiveness><Ethene, tetrafluoro-, homopolymer><Evaluation><Extremities><FDA approved><Factor I><Factor One><Failure><Fibrinogen><Fluorocarbons><Goals><Guinea Pigs><Guinea Pigs Mammals><Heart Vascular><Heparin><Heparinic Acid><Histologic><Histologically><History><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Hour><Hyperplasia><Hyperplastic><Image><In Vitro><Infection><Isolated limb perfusion><Leanness><Legal patent><Ligand Binding Protein><Ligand Binding Protein Gene><Limb Perfusion><Limb structure><Limbs><Liquid substance><Lytotoxicity><Marketing><Measures><Medical Device><Microbial Biofilms><Modification><Non-Trunk><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Outcome><Ovine><Ovis><PTFE><Patents><Pathologic Constriction><Pathological Constriction><Patient Care><Patient Care Delivery><Patient outcome><Patient-Centered Outcomes><Patient-Focused Outcomes><Patients><Perfluorocarbons><Peripheral><Peripheral arterial disease><Phase><Physiologic><Physiological><Plasma><Plasma Serum><Polytef><Polytetrafluoroethylene><Prevention><Procedures><Process><Protein Binding><Proteins><Recording of previous events><Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma><Saline><Saline Solution><Sampling><Sheep><Stenosis><Structure><Surface><Surgeon><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><Technology><Testing><Thinness><Thrombase><Thrombin><Thrombosis><Thrombus><Ulcer><Ulceration><Vascular Graft><Vascular Prosthesis><Veins><Weight><Whole Blood><artificial blood vessels><biocompatibility><biofilm><biologic><biomaterial compatibility><bound protein><canine animal model><canine model><care for patients><care of patients><caring for patients><circulatory system><commercialization><critical limb Ischemia><cytotoxicity><design><designing><developmental><dog model><efficacy study><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><fibrinogenase><fluid><fungus><genotoxicity><good laboratory practice><graft dysfunction><graft failure><hemocompatibility><histories><hospital re-admission><hospital readmission><imaging><implantation><improved><improved outcome><in vivo><invention><liquid><manufacture><medical implant><pathogen><patient oriented outcomes><peripheral artery disease><prevent><preventing><re-admission><re-hospitalization><readmission><rehospitalization><standard of care><success><surgery><systemic toxicity><tech development><technology development><thrombogenesis><thrombogenicity><thrombotic disease><thrombotic disorder><tissue wound><vascular><weights><wound><wounding><wounds>",Assistive Technology; Bioengineering; Cardiovascular; Hematology; Prevention
Pulmonary Rehabilitation for Rural Patients with COPD ,Pulmonary Rehabilitation for Rural Patients with COPD ,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
Globally, COPD prevalence is estimated to be 11.7%, and COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the
United States (US). The age-adjusted prevalence of COPD is double in rural (8.2%) compared to urban areas
(4.7%). Rurality is associated with worse COPD outcomes, such as more severe dyspnea, poorer self-
rated health, lower health-related quality of life (HRQL), and increased risk of acute exacerbations. Significant
geographical disparities exist in treating and managing COPD in the United States. Less than 8% of rural
patients have access to pulmonary rehabilitation, a critical treatment for COPD patients that improves
all outcomes and decreases health care utilization. This project addresses an important SDOH
problem: access to proper care. It will provide pulmonary rehabilitation that promotes physical activity and
exercise, as well as customized education with personalized support through health coaching for patients with
COPD in rural areas. Our prior NIH-funded research in the delivery of Home-based rehabilitation, in addition to
the current literature, supports the scientific rationale and need for a clinical trial to test the proposed
hypothesis.
This application aims to test the uptake, effectiveness, and patient-caregiver-provider experience of home-
based pulmonary rehabilitation with health coaching for COPD patients in rural communities.
The proposed research that addresses access to care as the main social determinant of health will consider
patient/community priorities, needs, and preferences through a personalized approach through health
coaching. The program has been tested effective in two large NIH-funded randomized studies but not
specifically tested in rural settings. The comprehensive qualitative assessment of the intervention will inform
any necessary adaptation.
The proposed intervention will address two aspects of social injustice in COPD: inadequate COPD care and
lack of support (factors that make living with COPD more difficult than it should be, i.e., social isolation in rural
areas). If the project aims are achieved, an increased pulmonary rehabilitation uptake and improved physical
and emotional quality of life will advance the scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice
of rural patients living with COPD. Our results may inform the remote care for other chronic conditions in rural
patients (heart failure, hypertension, obesity, diabetes).","<Access to Care><Acute><Address><Age><Air Pollution><Anxiety><Breathlessness><COPD><Care Givers><Caregivers><Caring><Cause of Death><Chronic><Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease><Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease><Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease><Clinical Trials><Communities><Data><Decrease disparity><Diabetes Mellitus><Disease Outcome><Dyspnea><Economic Income><Economical Income><Education><Educational aspects><Effectiveness><Emotional><Environmental Exposure><Equitable healthcare><Funding><Health><Health Care Providers><Health Care Utilization><Health Personnel><Health Services Accessibility><Healthcare Providers><Healthcare equity><Healthcare worker><Heart failure><Home><Hypertension><Income><Inequality><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Intervention Trial><Interventional trial><Knowledge><Literature><Loneliness><Lower disparity><Lung Diseases><Measures><Medical Rehabilitation><Mental Depression><Methods><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Obesity><Outcome><Patient Recruitments><Patients><Perception><Personalized medical approach><Physical Exercise><Physical activity><Prevalence><Provider><Pulmonary Diseases><Pulmonary Disorder><QOL><Quality of life><Questionnaires><Randomized><Randomized, Controlled Trials><Rehabilitation><Rehabilitation therapy><Reporting><Research><Risk><Rural><Rural Community><Rural Population><Rural group><Rural people><Scientific Advances and Accomplishments><Social isolation><Social support><Testing><Time><United States><United States National Institutes of Health><Vascular Hypertensive Disease><Vascular Hypertensive Disorder><access to health care><access to health services><access to healthcare><access to services><access to treatment><accessibility of health care><accessibility to health care><accessibility to health services><accessibility to healthcare><actigraph><actigraphy><adiposity><ages><availability of services><barrier to care><barrier to health care><barrier to healthcare><barrier to treatment><barriers to implementation><cardiac failure><care access><care as usual><chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder><clinical practice><corpulence><depression><diabetes><disease of the lung><disorder of the lung><disparity reduction><effective intervention><evidence base><experience><formative assessment><formative evaluation><geographic barrier><geographic disadvantage><geographic disparity><geographic inequality><geographic inequity><geographic limitation><geographic location disparity><health care access><health care availability><health care personnel><health care service access><health care service availability><health care service use><health care service utilization><health care worker><health provider><health related quality of life><health service access><health services availability><health workforce><healthcare access><healthcare accessibility><healthcare availability><healthcare personnel><healthcare service access><healthcare service availability><healthcare service use><healthcare service utilization><healthcare utilization><high blood pressure><homes><hyperpiesia><hyperpiesis><hypertensive disease><hypertensive disorder><implementation barriers><implementation challenges><improved><incomes><individualized approach><insight><interventional strategy><lonely><lung disorder><lung rehabilitation><medical personnel><mitigate disparity><mortality><obstacle to care><obstacle to healthcare><participant interview><participant recruitment><personalized approach><precision approach><preference><programs><prospective><pulmonary rehabilitation><randomisation><randomization><randomized control trial><randomly assigned><reduce disparity><reduction in disparity><rehab therapy><rehabilitative><rehabilitative therapy><remote care><remote health care><remote healthcare><respiratory><rural America><rural area><rural dwellers><rural individual><rural locality><rural location><rural patients><rural place><rural region><rural resident><rural setting><rurality><scientific accomplishments><scientific advances><sedentary><service availability><social><social health determinants><social support network><tailored approach><testing uptake><treatment access><treatment as usual><treatment provider><uptake><urban area><urban location><urban region><usual care>",Behavioral and Social Science; Cardiovascular; Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Health Services; Lung; Physical Activity; Physical Rehabilitation; Prevention; Rehabilitation; Rural Health; Social Determinants of Health
Assessing Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors-induced Cardiotoxicity with an Organoid-AI System,Assessing Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors-induced Cardiotoxicity with an Organoid-AI System,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are specified small-molecule inhibitors of the activity of tyrosine kinases and
have shown therapeutic impact on treating cancers. Despite being a prevalent class of drugs in the
pharmaceutical industry, their development and clinical application are frequently hindered by a wide range of
cardiovascular complications: QT prolongation/arrhythmia, left ventricular dysfunction, congestive heart failure,
ischemia, myocardial infarction, and hypertension. Cardiotoxicity's repercussions impede the advancement of
novel TKIs for cancer therapy and furthermore cause failures in preclinical drug discovery and clinical
development. Therefore, there is an urgent need to assess cardiotoxicity induced by TKIs used in cancer
patients' treatment. However, there is still no targeted and effective preclinical trial due to a) only focusing on
anti-tumor effects without systematic examination of coexisting cardiovascular effects, b) limited efficiency and
accuracy of cardiotoxicity prediction, and c) inter-species differences between animals and humans on
cardiotoxic responses. To address this unmet need, a new in vitro human model for comprehensively assessing
TKIs-indued cardiotoxicity is proposed here. Recently, human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived vascularized
cardiac organoids (VCOs) developed in PI’s and other labs have shown great promise in emulating the human
heart in both cardiovascular structure and function, which makes it an ideal in vitro drug toxicity evaluation system
targeting cardiovascular cells by TKIs. However, three significant challenges remain in applying hPSC-derived
VCOs to cardiotoxicity evaluation: 1) insufficient and uncoupled assessment of organoid structural and functional
properties; 2) continuous generation of large datasets from multifaceted characterizations that requires more
integrated analysis without human bias; 3) low efficiency with more individual hPSC lines. It is hypothesized that
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven biomedical data featuring and predicting address the challenges for accurately
assessing TKI-induced cardiotoxicity by phenotyping the cardiovascular structure and function of VCOs. The
central goal is to establish an organoid-AI system to assess TKI-induced cardiotoxicity efficiently and accurately
with three specific aims: Aim 1. Predict TKI-induced toxicity on cardiovascular structure in VCOs by Generative
AI algorithm; Aim 2. Phenotype TKI-induced cardiovascular dysfunction in VCOs; Aim 3. Establish a TKI-induced
cardiotoxicity assessment system with an organoid-AI system. Upon completion of the proposed project, a
comprehensive human organoid-AI system for assessing TKI-induced cardiotoxicity will be established to
increase the efficiency and accuracy of preclinical drug safety evaluation of TKIs on human cardiotoxicity on both
cardiovascular structure and function.",<AI algorithm><AI system><Action Potentials><Active Oxygen><Address><Animals><Arrhythmia><Artificial Intelligence><Calcium><Cancer Patient><Cancer Treatment><Cancers><Cardiac><Cardiac Abnormalities><Cardiac Arrhythmia><Cardiac Failure Congestive><Cardiac Toxicity><Cardiac infarction><Cardiotoxic><Cardiotoxicity><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular Physiology><Cardiovascular system><Categories><Cell Body><Cell Components><Cell Line><Cell Structure><Cell Survival><Cell Viability><CellLine><Cells><Cellular Structures><Classification><Color><Computer Reasoning><Congestive Heart Failure><Data><Data Analyses><Data Analysis><Development><Double-Blind Method><Double-Blind Study><Double-Blinded><Double-Masked Method><Double-Masked Study><Drug Evaluation><Drug Evaluation Studies><Drug Industry><Drug toxicity><Drugs><Dysfunction><EPH- and ELK-Related Tyrosine Kinase><EPH-and ELK-Related Kinase><Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator><Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide><Ephrin Type-A Receptor 8><Ephrin Type-A Receptor 8 Precursor><Evaluation><Expert Systems><FDA approved><Failure><Fluorescence><Functional disorder><Generations><Goals><Heart><Heart Abnormalities><Heart Arrhythmias><Heart Decompensation><Heart Vascular><Human><Hypertension><In Vitro><Individual><Intelligent systems><Ischemia><Label><Left Ventricular Dysfunction><Machine Intelligence><Malignant Neoplasm Therapy><Malignant Neoplasm Treatment><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Measurable><Measurement><Measures><Medication><Modern Man><Molecular><Mononitrogen Monoxide><Myocardial Infarct><Myocardial Infarction><Nitric Oxide><Nitrogen Monoxide><Nitrogen Protoxide><Organoids><Oxygen Radicals><PTK Inhibitors><Pattern><Pharmaceutic Industry><Pharmaceutical Industry><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phenotype><Physiopathology><Pro-Oxidants><Production><Property><Protein Tyrosine Kinase><Protein Tyrosine Kinase EEK><Protein Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors><Proteomics><RNA Seq><RNA sequencing><RNAseq><Reactive Oxygen Species><Reporter><Reporter Genes><Specific qualifier value><Specified><Strains Cell Lines><Structure><System><Systematics><TK Inhibitors><Therapeutic><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Training><Tyrosine Kinase><Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor><Tyrosine-Protein Kinase Receptor EEK><Tyrosine-Specific Protein Kinase><Tyrosylprotein Kinase><Vascular Hypertensive Disease><Vascular Hypertensive Disorder><Vascularization><Visualization><adversarial neural network><anti-cancer therapy><anti-tumor effect><antitumor effect><artificial intelligence algorithm><cancer therapy><cancer-directed therapy><cardiac infarct><cardiovascular effects><cardiovascular function><cardiovascular imaging><chronic heart failure><circulatory system><clinical applicability><clinical application><clinical development><clinical diagnosis><clinical practice><coronary attack><coronary infarct><coronary infarction><cultured cell line><data interpretation><developmental><directed differentiation><drug discovery><drug safety><drug/agent><endothelial cell derived relaxing factor><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><fluorescence imaging><fluorescent imaging><generative AI><generative adversarial network><generative artificial intelligence><generative neural network><heart attack><heart infarct><heart infarction><high blood pressure><human model><human pluripotent stem cell><hydroxyaryl protein kinase><hyperpiesia><hyperpiesis><hypertensive disease><hypertensive disorder><large data sets><large datasets><left ventricle abnormality><live cell image><live cell imaging><live cellular image><live cellular imaging><machine learned algorithm><machine learning algorithm><machine learning based algorithm><malignancy><medication safety><model of human><neoplasm/cancer><network models><novel><pathophysiology><pharmaceutical safety><pre-clinical><pre-clinical trial><preclinical><preclinical trial><response><small molecular inhibitor><small molecule inhibitor><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing><tyrosyl protein kinase>,Bioengineering; Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Embryonic - Human; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Human
Right ventricle remodeling in pulmonary hypertension,Right ventricle remodeling in pulmonary hypertension,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Failure of the right ventricle (RV) is a main component of the morbidity and mortality of pulmonary hypertension
(PH). There exists no specific treatment for RV dysfunction and failure and the only cure for many patients
(especially in the case of pulmonary arterial hypertension) remains transplantation. This is partially due to the
critical lack of understanding of RV biology; therapeutic strategies that are beneficial for LV failure have worse
outcomes when applied to those with RV failure. What has been observed in RV dysfunction in human subjects
and animal models is exaggerated fibrosis and divergent contractile and hypertrophic responses to several drugs
when compared to LV dysfunction. Thus, the RV may contain distinct pathobiology compared to the LV that has
high significance for treatment of PH. Cardiac myocytes may have distinct cell signaling properties in the RV,
though there is a lot unknown about these differences. Previous work has shown that RV cardiac myocytes,
compared to those from the LV, have increased K+ current, shorter action potential duration, reduced sarcomere
shortening, and reduced peak intracellular Ca2+ when compared to LV cardiac myocytes. These differences
demonstrate that RV cardiac myocytes may have molecular differences at a functional level. This diversity
supplement will determine how contractility, calcium handling, and size of the cardiac myocyte change during
RV remodeling in PH, and determine and test novel drug targets that alter RV contractility. These data may
uncover novel understanding of RV cardiac myocyte biology and lead to further therapeutic strategies for right
heart failure. This supplement will address this concern with two Specific Aims: (1) Determine the mechanism of
cardiac myocyte adaptation to RV pressure overload. and (2) Interrogate GPCR targets in the RV as potential
therapeutic targets.",<Action Potentials><Affect><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Biology><Calcium><Cardiac Muscle Cells><Cardiac Myocytes><Cardiac Ventricles><Cardiocyte><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Data><Development><Disease><Disorder><Drugs><Dysfunction><Failure><Fibrosis><Functional disorder><G Protein-Complex Receptor><G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes><G-Protein-Coupled Receptors><GPCR><Heart Muscle Cells><Heart Ventricle><Heart myocyte><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Knowledge><Medication><Molecular><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Outcome><Patients><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Physiopathology><Property><Pulmonary Hypertension><Research><Right Ventricles><Right Ventricular Dysfunction><Right heart dysfunction><Right ventricle dysfunction><Right ventricular structure><Right-sided heart dysfunction><Sarcomeres><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Testing><Therapeutic><Transplantation><Work><biological signal transduction><cardiac dimension><cardiac size><cardiomyocyte><developmental><direct application><drug/agent><heart dimension><heart dimension/size><heart size><human subject><model of animal><mortality><new drug target><new drug treatments><new druggable target><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new pharmacotherapy target><new therapeutic target><new therapeutics><new therapy><new therapy target><next generation therapeutics><novel><novel drug target><novel drug treatments><novel druggable target><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel pharmacotherapy target><novel therapeutic target><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><novel therapy target><pathophysiology><pressure><pulmonary arterial hypertension><pulmonary artery hypertension><response><right heart failure><right sided heart failure><right ventricle failure><right ventricle remodeling><right ventricular failure><right ventricular heart failure><right ventricular remodeling><targeted drug therapy><targeted drug treatments><targeted therapeutic><targeted therapeutic agents><targeted therapy><targeted treatment><therapeutic target><transplant>,Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Lung; Pulmonary Hypertension
Sustaining Home Palliative Care for Patients with Heart Failure (HF) and Their Family Caregivers in Rural Appalachia: A Mixed Methods Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT),Sustaining Home Palliative Care for Patients with Heart Failure (HF) and Their Family Caregivers in Rural Appalachia: A Mixed Methods Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT),"Project Summary
Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of mortality, morbidity, and rehospitalizations in Appalachia. Rural areas
have the highest HF mortality rates. West Virginia (WV), the only state totally within the Appalachian region, has
the highest HF death rate in the U.S. (32.6 per 100,000; the substantial deaths in those over 65 years). HF is
devastating for patients and their family caregivers, especially during the HF end stages. Families are
unprepared for this deteriorating condition, the home caregiving burdens, and the fear of a painful death. Further,
rural Appalachians lack access to health services, end-of-life palliative care (EOLPC), and have extreme
inequities in health.
The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to test the integrated nurse-led intervention bundle of 1) HF-
FamPALhomeCARE, 2) Visiting Neighbors supporting functional health, and 3) Appalachia Faith-based nurses
providing comforting palliative care. The preliminary studies verified the bundle components. This RCT is guided
by the social support conceptual theory consistent with Appalachian culture. This intervention bundle addresses
rural disparities in the lack of access to health care which the faith-based nurses and rural volunteers visiting
neighbors address. The intervention components are designed to address several Appalachian social
determinants of health (SDoH) disparities, such as reducing costs by nurses enabling direct access to health
services, clearly illustrated HF home care guides for low literacy, and inspections for safe housing for older
adults. This mixed methods RCT will address Primary Aims (1 & 2), testing the outcomes of patients with HF
and family caregivers (92 dyads) managing home supportive EOLPC in rural WV. Secondary Aim (3) is to
assess the bundled intervention helpfulness, cost, and plans for maintaining the sustainability of our visiting
neighbor volunteers, and the Faith Nurse of rural WV. Descriptive measures, group comparisons, intervention
costs, and focus group discussions will be reported. The qualitative results will be compared to the social support
framework, quantitative results and to the results of the Aim 3a helpfulness ratings to identify any other facilitators
or barriers to sustainability.
This R01 study supports research to improve rural health equity by providing access to health services and
addressing SDoH disparities in underrepresented Appalachia. Designing and testing practical, sustainable
approaches using the available rural resources to address a prevalent, devastating disease, family EOLPC
preferences, older adults' functional health, HF home caregiving skills, and providing social support. Engaging
rural stakeholders in recruitment, implementation, and designing sustainability plans can result in continuing
research on the health, EOLPC and SDoH disparities of the 26.3 million people living across Appalachia. The
long-term impact will be pragmatic strategies for other rural Appalachian states.","<65 and older><65 or older><65 years of age and older><65 years of age or more><65 years of age or older><65+ years><65+ years old><> 65 years><Access to Care><Active Follow-up><Address><Aged 65 and Over><Aging><American><Anxiety><Appalachia><Appalachian><Appalachian Region><Cessation of life><Collaborations><Control Groups><Death><Death Rate><Deterioration><Discipline of Nursing><Disease><Disorder><Disparities><Disparity><Faith><Family><Family Care Giver><Family Caregiver><Fear><Focus Groups><Fright><Health><Health Inequity><Health Services Accessibility><Healthcare><Heart failure><Home><Home Care><Housing><Improve Access><Inequalities in Health><Inequities in Health><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Managed Care><Measures><Mental Depression><Methods><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Nurses><Nursing><Nursing Field><Nursing Profession><Outcome><Pain><Painful><Palliative Care><Palliative Therapy><Palliative Treatment><Participant><Patient Care><Patient Care Delivery><Patient outcome><Patient-Centered Outcomes><Patient-Focused Outcomes><Patients><Personal Satisfaction><Persons><Phone><Policies><Preparedness><QOL><Quality of life><Questionnaires><Randomized, Controlled Trials><Readiness><Religion><Reporting><Research><Research Resources><Research Support><Resources><Rural><Rural Appalachia><Rural Appalachian><Rural health equity><Social support><Telephone><Testing><Travel><Visit><West Virginia><World Health Organization><above age 65><access disparities><access to health care><access to health services><access to healthcare><access to services><access to treatment><accessibility disparities><accessibility of health care><accessibility to health care><accessibility to health services><accessibility to healthcare><active followup><advanced directive><after age 65><age 65 and greater><age 65 and older><age 65 or older><age > 65><age of 65 years onward><aged 65 and greater><aged 65+><aged ≥65><availability of services><cardiac failure><care access><care for patients><care giving><care giving burden><care of patients><caregiving><caregiving burden><caregiving stress><caring for patients><comfort care><comparator group><compare to control><comparison control><comparison group><cost><depression><design><designing><disparities in access><disparity in health><end of life><end-of-life><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><group intervention><health care><health care access><health care availability><health care service access><health care service availability><health disparity><health equity><health inequalities><health service access><health services availability><healthcare access><healthcare accessibility><healthcare availability><healthcare service access><healthcare service availability><homes><hospital re-admission><hospital readmission><human old age (65+)><implementation cost><implementation investment><improved><inequality in access><inequity in access><inequity in accessibility><intervention cost><interventional strategy><literacy><mortality><mortality rate><mortality ratio><nurse><old age><older adult><older adulthood><over 65 years><participant enrollment><patient enrollment><patient home care><patient homecare><patient oriented outcomes><preference><programs><randomized control trial><randomized, clinical trials><re-admission><re-hospitalization><readmission><recruit><rehospitalization><religious><rural area><rural disparities><rural location><rural region><rural under represented><rural underrepresented><service availability><skills><social health determinants><social support network><theories><treatment access><volunteer><well-being><wellbeing><≥65 years>",Aging; Behavioral and Social Science; Cardiovascular; Caregiving Research; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Health Services; Heart Disease; Pain Research; Palliative Care; Rural Health; Social Determinants of Health
Nox4 and Epigenetics in chronically enhanced cardiac protein O-GlcNAcylation,Nox4 and Epigenetics in chronically enhanced cardiac protein O-GlcNAcylation,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Global diabetes prevalence is nearing 10%, and despite advancements in treatments, compared to non-diabetic,
individuals with diabetes have 2-fold higher rates of heart failure, as well as increased mortality due to
cardiovascular disease. Specifically, diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a diagnosis based on cardiac
insufficiency attributable only to diabetes, and characterized by the triad of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and
apoptosis. We believe these are consequences of and contributors to epigenetic changes that regulate
expression of genes responsible for the pathological state. Epigenetic changes are stable, yet reversible
modifications to chromatin and genetic material (e.g., histones, DNA). It is an established regulator of gene
expression associated with diabetes and heart failure—with the field studying the intersection of these topics still
relatively young. Additionally, our prior work found that glucose can signal through a specific post-translational
protein modification, O-linked -N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc), and building upon current literature, our lab
has shown using our novel mouse model that chronically enhanced O-GlcNAc is sufficient to cause pathology
associated with diabetic hearts. My work focuses on identifying and studying molecular pathways regulated by
DNA methylation changes during chronic O-GlcNAc which lead to pathology. Upon RNA-sequencing, my prior
analysis identified significantly increased NADPH Oxidase 4 (Nox4) with chronically increased cardiac protein
O-GlcNAc. Similarly, methylation-sequencing of DNA from cardiac tissue of diabetic mice revealed hypo-
methylation (an epigenetic mark associated with increased gene expression) at the Nox4 promoter associated
CPG island. Nox4 is a significant producer of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and its activity is governed by
levels of expression. The field of Nox4 in the context of chronic diabetic hearts is relatively young, and little is
known about its regulatory mechanisms. With these opportunities and encouraging preliminary data, I seek to
build upon the rigors of past research to contribute novel knowledge and develop resources to study Nox4’s
regulation and role in chronic diabetic hearts. I hypothesize that with chronically enhanced protein O-GlcNAc (a
key facet of diabetic hearts), cardiac Nox4 is induced via DNA hypomethylation, and its upregulation is necessary
to promote cardiac dysfunction and pathology. The proposal will test the following two aims: (1) Determine the
mechanism of O-GlcNAcylation initiated DNA methylation changes leading to cardiac Nox4 upregulation. (2)
Establish that Nox4 depletion can prevent cardiac remodeling seen during chronically enhanced cardiac protein

Patterning Mechanisms for Ventricular Septation and Congenital Heart Disease,Patterning Mechanisms for Ventricular Septation and Congenital Heart Disease,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The most common congenital heart disease (CHD) in children involves incomplete formation of the
interventricular septum (IVS), which occurs in isolation or as part of more complex CHD lesions. Myocardial fiber
orientation, lineage tracing and asymmetric gene expression together suggest distinct L-R patterning of the IVS.
However, there exists a gap in the understanding of the developmental mechanisms of IVS patterning and VSD
etiologies. This hinders improvements to CHD prenatal screening, prognosis and evaluation of extra-cardiac
anomalies, as well as efforts to engineer tissue patches for heart repair. The overall objective of this proposal
is to delineate how L-R IVS patterning is controlled, and how perturbations lead to VSDs. We have preliminary
data that suggests the secreted guidance cues Ntn1 and Slit2 control boundary regulation for L-R patterning of
the IVS. Both genes were dysregulated in a genetic pathway dependent on the CHD-linked transcription factor,
Tbx5. We found that homozygous loss of function (LOF) of Ntn1 or Slit2 resulted in membranous or muscular
VSDs and a trabecular-like IVS. Ntn1 LOF led to displacement of the IVS boundary toward the LV, suggesting
that Ntn1 may be a key regulator of boundary positioning. Conversely, Slit2 LOF disrupted boundary integrity,
leading to mixing of RV and LV lineages, suggesting Slit2 regulation of boundary maintenance. Based on these
preliminary data, we hypothesize that NTN1 and SLIT2 control complementary aspects of boundary regulation
to segregate LV and RV lineages at the IVS for L-R patterning and ventricular septation. To discover how these
developmental cues direct ventricular septation, we propose the following three Specific Aims: (1) test the
hypothesis that NTN1 from the left side of the IVS determines boundary positioning for L-R IVS patterning by
chemorepulsion, (2) test the hypothesis that a SLIT2 signal from the RV and LV maintains boundary integrity to
preserve cell segregation for L-R IVS patterning by chemorepulsion of IVS cells, and (3) test the hypothesis that
boundary perturbations of L-R IVS patterning cause cell signature disturbances of misplaced cells and adjacent
tissue microenvironments. Successful completion of this project will provide insights into the regulation of L-R
IVS patterning and the origins of human CHDs. By expanding our comprehension of the basis of CHDs, we will
take an important step towards our long-term goal to improve the natural history of CHDs.",<0-11 years old><Adhesions><Assay><Basal Transcription Factor><Basal transcription factor genes><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Blood Vessels><Body Tissues><Candidate Disease Gene><Candidate Gene><Cardiac><Cardiac Malformation><Causality><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Isolation><Cell Locomotion><Cell Migration><Cell Movement><Cell Segregation><Cell Separation><Cell Separation Technology><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cellular Migration><Cellular Motility><Chemotaxis><Child><Child Youth><Children (0-21)><Collagen><Complex><Comprehension><Cues><Data><Defect><Development><Embryo><Embryonic><Etiology><Evaluation><Exclusion><Fiber><Gel><Gene Expression><General Transcription Factor Gene><General Transcription Factors><Genes><Genetic><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic Markers><Genetic defect><Goals><Heart><Heart Malformation><Heart failure><Human><Infant><Interventricular Septum><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Knowledge><Lead><Left><Left Ventricles><Left ventricular structure><Lesion><Ligands><Link><Machine Learning><Maintenance><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><Mouse Homolog of NETRIN 1><Murine><Mus><Muscle><Muscle Tissue><Mutation><Myocardial><NETRIN 1-Like><NTN1><NTN1 gene><NTN1 gene product><NTN1L><Natural History><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Outcome><Pathway interactions><Pattern><Pb element><Population><Position><Positioning Attribute><Prognosis><Receptor Protein><Regulation><Right Ventricles><Right ventricular structure><Role><Side><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Structure><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><Testing><Tissue Engineering><Tissues><Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene><Transcription factor genes><Transgenes><Ventricular><Ventricular Heart Septal Defects><Ventricular Septal Defects><Ventricular septum><Work><abnormal heart development><bioengineered tissue><biological signal transduction><cardiac failure><cardiac repair><causation><cell motility><cell sorting><cell type><congenital cardiac abnormality><congenital cardiac anomalies><congenital cardiac disease><congenital cardiac disorder><congenital cardiac malformation><congenital heart abnormality><congenital heart anomaly><congenital heart disease><congenital heart disorder><congenital heart malformation><developmental><disease causation><engineered tissue><gene biomarker><gene expression biomarker><gene marker><gene signature biomarker><genetic biomarker><genome mutation><heart repair><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><improved><insight><kids><loss of function><machine based learning><morphometry><muscular><mutant><netrin-1><neural><overexpress><overexpression><pathway><prenatal screening><prenatal testing><preservation><prevent><preventing><receptor><repair><repaired><scRNA-seq><segregation><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single-cell RNA sequencing><social role><surgery><transcription factor><transcriptomics><transgene><vascular><youngster>,Cardiovascular; Congenital Heart Disease; Congenital Structural Anomalies; Genetics; Heart Disease; Pediatric; Rare Diseases
Physical Activity in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (ACTiPH),Physical Activity in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (ACTiPH),"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by limitation of physical activity even with current
effect treatments. Most observational studies, clinical trials, and outpatient clinical assessments of patients with
PAH focus on exercise capacity (the maximal effort a person can achieve under controlled circumstances),
measured by cardiopulmonary exercise or six minute walk testing. However, these artificial tests do not
capture the intensity, frequency, duration, context, and pattern of physical activity throughout the day or week
in the patient’s life. Such an activity “signature” or phenotype may more accurately reflect an individual’s
function and perceived health-related quality of life (HRQOL) by providing insight into multisystem function,
side effects, and treatment benefits and burdens. A physical activity intervention which is personalized for a
PAH patient could lead to improvements in psychosocial function, symptoms, HRQOL, fitness, and even
survival. Unfortunately, there have been very few published studies of physical activity in PAH patients, none of
which have assessed multidimensionality in a large multicenter cohort. We have performed preliminary studies
using traditional accelerometry which have shown that patients with PAH cluster into low, medium, and high
activity phenotypes which show differences in six minute walk distance and HRQOL. Functional principal
components analysis has identified “signatures” of physical activity patterns throughout the day in PAH. Novel
biosensors which continuously capture multiple streams of data in real time (including accelerometry) would
provide an innovative approach to remote clinical monitoring and may increase the efficiency and pertinence of
clinical trials in PAH.
 The Pulmonary Hypertension Association Registry (PHAR) has been prospectively collecting data from
adult and pediatric PAH patients from centers throughout the United States since 2015. The PHAR has
enrolled 1400 patients with 2000 patient-years of follow-up at 52 centers, representing one of the largest
multicenter registries of patients with PAH. We propose to measure accelerometry for one week periods
biannually for > 1400 patients over four years (~7000 assessments) in the PHAR with high efficiency and low
patient burden. We aim to determine the predictors of physical activity phenotype and whether physical activity
patterns are associated with health-related quality of life, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and
time to lung transplantation or death in PAH. We will estimate the “minimally important difference” in physical
activity which could be used as an end point in clinical trials in PAH. We will incorporate a novel wearable
biosensor which could be used to advance these models of physical activity in PAH.","<21+ years old><65 and older><65 or older><65 years of age and older><65 years of age or more><65 years of age or older><65+ years><65+ years old><> 65 years><Accelerometer><Active Follow-up><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Age><Aged 65 and Over><Ancillary Study><Biosensor><Blood Vessels><Cardiac><Cardiopulmonary><Caring><Cessation of life><Childhood><Clinical><Clinical Trials><Clinical assessments><Data><Death><Defect><Dimensions><Disease><Disorder><ED visit><ER visit><Educational Achievement><Educational Status><Emergency care visit><Emergency department visit><Emergency hospital visit><Emergency room visit><Endothelium><Enrollment><Environmental Factor><Environmental Risk Factor><Epoprostenol><Exercise><Frequencies><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Hour><Individual><Intravenous><Leiomyocyte><Life><Lung><Lung Grafting><Lung Respiratory System><Lung Transplantation><Measures><Medical><Monitor><Muscle><Muscle Tissue><Observation research><Observation study><Observational Study><Observational research><Out-patients><Outcome Study><Outpatients><PGI2><Patient Monitoring><Patients><Pattern><Peripheral><Personal Satisfaction><Persons><Phenotype><Physical activity><Pilot Projects><Population><Principal Component Analyses><Principal Component Analysis><Proliferating><Prostaglandin I2><Publishing><Pulmonary Graft><Pulmonary Hypertension><Pulmonary Transplant><Pulmonary Transplantation><Pump><QOL><Quality of life><Registries><SF-12><Severities><Smooth Muscle Cells><Smooth Muscle Myocytes><Smooth Muscle Tissue Cell><Symptoms><System><Systemic disease><Testing><Time><United States><Walking><above age 65><accelerometry><active followup><activity monitor><activity tracker><adulthood><adverse event risk><after age 65><age 65 and greater><age 65 and older><age 65 or older><age > 65><age of 65 years onward><aged 65 and greater><aged 65+><aged ≥65><ages><biological sensor><body sensor><body worn sensor><clinical care><cohort><data streams><design><designing><educational level><emotional factor><enroll><environmental risk><evidence base><exercise capacity><exercise intervention><fitness><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><health related quality of life><high risk><human old age (65+)><improved><indexing><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><instrument><lung transplant><muscular><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new therapeutics><new therapy><next generation therapeutics><novel><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><old age><over 65 years><patient centered><patient oriented><patient registry><pediatric><physical activity intervention><physical model><pilot study><prospective><prostaglandin X><psychosocial><pulmonary><pulmonary arterial hypertension><pulmonary artery hypertension><randomized, clinical trials><residence><residential building><residential site><right heart failure><right sided heart failure><right ventricle failure><right ventricular failure><right ventricular heart failure><sedentary><sex><side effect><socio-economic><socio-economically><socioeconomically><socioeconomics><supplemental oxygen><training achievement><training level><training status><treatment effect><vascular><vascular bed><wearable biosensor><wearable sensor><wearable sensor technology><well-being><wellbeing><≥65 years>",Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Lung; Physical Activity; Prevention; Pulmonary Hypertension; Rare Diseases
Platform for Extended Kidney Preservation Via Subnormothermic Perfusion,Platform for Extended Kidney Preservation Via Subnormothermic Perfusion,"Kidney transplantation is currently the optimal renal replacement therapy due to reduced morbidity and mortality,
better quality of life, and decreased cost compared to dialysis. However, transplants remain severely limited by
a shortage of donor kidneys available for transplantation, with over 90,000 patients on the waiting list. This
imbalance in supply and demand has resulted in a strong desire to use high-risk kidney grafts from older donors
and donors after circulatory death (DCD). These high-risk kidney grafts often incur significant injury during
preservation and transportation prior to transplantation, leading to diminished graft survival. As such, high-risk
kidney grafts are discarded at high rates because of the inability to predict their function. To improve the
preservation and acceptance of high-risk kidney grafts, including DCD kidneys, investigators at the Duke Ex Vivo
Organ Lab (DEVOL) and BioMedInnovations LLC (BMI) have developed a unique subnormothermic (22-25°C,
approximately room temperature) oxygenated perfusion platform, consisting of a perfusion device and matched
“DEVOL solution”. Pilot studies using a porcine model of DCD kidney transplantation demonstrated significant
improvements in post-transplant kidney graft function versus the historical standard of care, static cold storage
(SCS).
Consistent with the NIDDK SBIR research priority “development of devices or techniques to enhance the long-
term success of kidney transplantation (e.g., techniques for kidney storage and preservation)”, this project will
generate evidence that the BMI platform provides superior performance to the current standard of care for high-
risk kidneys, namely hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP). Availability of this data would result in this
technology rapidly moving forward to commercialization.
The project includes Specific Aims to 1) optimize the engineering aspects of BMI’s platform (consisting of the
device and perfusate); 2) determine, ex-vivo, the impact of warm ischemic injury and duration of device
preservation on kidney graft injury for the BMI platform versus the current standard of care; and 3) compare the
function of high-risk kidney grafts preserved with the BMI platform versus the current standard of care using a
porcine kidney auto-transplant model.
The outcome of this project will include preclinical evidence that demonstrates that BMI’s platform is likely to
provide a meaningful advance over the current standard of care when used in humans and advance the platform
towards commercialization. This will help BMI to secure further investment, successfully engage with regulators
and ultimately, gain customer adoption that leads to improved access to kidneys for those on the transplant
waiting list.",<Adoption><American><Anoxia><Autograft><Autologous Transplantation><Autotransplant><Biochemistry><Biological Chemistry><Blood><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Blood Serum><Body Tissues><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Caring><Cessation of life><Clinical><Clinical Trials><Clinical assessments><Clotting><Coagulation><Coagulation Process><Computer software><Cost Savings><Creatinine><Cryofixation><Cryopreservation><Data><Death><Device or Instrument Development><Devices><Dialysis><Dialysis procedure><ESRD><End stage renal failure><End-Stage Kidney Disease><End-Stage Renal Disease><Engineering><Failure><Family suidae><Flushing><Foundations><Future><Good Manufacturing Process><Good manufacturing practice><Graft Survival><Grafting Procedure><Health><Heart Vascular><Histology><Human><Hypothermia><Ice><Improve Access><Injury><Investigators><Investments><Kidney><Kidney Grafting><Kidney Replacement Therapy><Kidney Transplantation><Kidney Transplants><Kidney Urinary System><Life><Measures><Methods><Modeling><Modern Man><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><NIDDK><National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases><O element><O2 element><Organ><Organ Preservation><Organ Transplantation><Organ Transplants><Outcome><Output><Oxygen><Patients><Performance><Perfusion><Physiologic pulse><Pigs><Pilot Projects><Policies><Process><Pulsatile Flow><Pulsatile Perfusion><Pulsating Flow><Pulse><QOL><Quality of life><Renal Grafting><Renal Replacement Therapy><Renal Transplantation><Renal Transplants><Reperfusion Therapy><Reporting><Research Personnel><Research Priority><Researchers><SBIR><Secure><Serum><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Software><Suidae><Swine><Techniques><Technology><Temperature><Testing><Tissues><Transplantation><Transportation><Urine><Waiting Lists><Warm Ischemia><Whole Blood><autologous graft><autotransplantation><circulatory system><clinical applicability><clinical application><clinical efficacy><co-morbid><co-morbidity><cold preservation><cold storage><commercialization><comorbidity><compare cost><cost><cost comparison><design><designing><device development><dialysis therapy><graft function><high risk><improved><injuries><instrument development><ischemia injury><ischemic injury><kidney preservation><kidney tx><mortality><natural hypothermia><organ allograft><organ graft><organ xenograft><payment><pig model><piglet model><pilot study><porcine><porcine model><post-transplant><post-transplantation><posttransplant><posttransplantation><pre-clinical><preclinical><preservation><public health relevance><renal><reperfusion><secondary outcome><standard of care><success><suid><swine model><transplant><transplant model><usability><waitlist>,Bioengineering; Kidney Disease; Organ Transplantation; Transplantation
Differential Impacts of Person and System Level Determinants of Health on Dyadic Heart Failure Management: The IMPACT-D Study,Differential Impacts of Person and System Level Determinants of Health on Dyadic Heart Failure Management: The IMPACT-D Study,"Heart failure (HF) is the fastest-growing cardiovascular disorder and a leading cause of urgent healthcare
utilization in the U.S. Effective HF physical self-care (i.e. behaviors that maintain physiologic stability (self-care
maintenance), monitor for changes in signs and symptoms (self-care monitoring), and respond to symptoms
when they occur (self-care management)) has been linked with better patient-reported, biological and clinical
outcomes. However relatively little is known about mental health self-care in HF. In addition, a growing body of
research includes informal care partners (e.g. family members who engage in an unpaid shared partnership in
care) increasing the need for a critical examination of the differential impact of physical and mental health of both
care partners on HF management; but, this is an emerging area of science. As managing HF at home has
increased in intensity/complexity, the mental health impact is of growing importance. Similarly, there are well-
known inequities and major advocacy calls to study social determinants of health in HF (i.e. race, ethnicity,
gender, economic resources, education, occupation and discrimination). Before we can intervene effectively,
however, we need to learn more from people with HF and their care partners about what they do to manage HF,
and how they maintain, monitor and manage their mental health. The proposed study addresses identified gaps
in both precision (mental health) and population (social determinants) health sciences. Accordingly, the goals of
this prospective, dyadic- and social determinants of health theory-informed study of 100 dyads are to gain insight
into the role that social determinants of health play as the root causes of some of the inequities about which we
know, and additional inequities we are likely to discover in this study. Specifically, we will quantify the
relationships between both symptoms and social determinants of health and contributions to care in people with
HF and their care partners (Aim 1), and then characterize people with HF and care partner contributions to the
maintenance, monitoring and management of mental health (Aim 2). Importantly, each aim is strongly rooted
with hypotheses of social determinants of health or preliminary data that suggest we will be successful in
achieving these aims. The results of this study will have an important and enduring influence on future theoretical
modification (embedding the dyad and mental health in “self”-care theory), measurement (centering the dyad),
and interventional development to promote optimal physical and mental health among HF dyads. Our long-term
goal is greater parity between physical and mental health in theoretical, measurement, and interventional
domains of HF management.",<21+ years old><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Advocacy><Affective Symptoms><Anxiety><Area><Behavior><Biological><Breathlessness><Cardiovascular Diseases><Caring><Caucasian Females><Caucasian Women><Clinical><Cognitive Discrimination><Data><Development><Diagnostic Findings><Discrimination><Dyspnea><Economics><Education><Educational aspects><Elements><Emotional Depression><Enrollment><Equity><Ethnic Origin><Ethnicity><Family member><Fatigue><Future><Gender><Goals><Grouping><Health><Health Care Utilization><Health Sciences><Heart failure><Home><Inequity><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Interview><Jobs><Lack of Energy><Learning><Link><Maintenance><Managed Care><Measurement><Measures><Mental Depression><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Methods><Modification><Monitor><Nausea><Occupations><Outcome><Pain><Painful><Patients><Persons><Physiologic><Physiological><Play><Population><Precision Health><Process><Professional Positions><Psyche structure><Psychological Health><QOL><Quality of life><Race><Races><Reporting><Research><Research Resources><Resources><Role><Science><Self Care><Signs and Symptoms><Sleep disturbances><Symptoms><System><Time><White Females><White Women><Work><aberrant sleep><adulthood><biologic><cardiac failure><cardiovascular disorder><cohort><depression><depression symptom><depressive><depressive symptoms><develop therapy><developmental><disrupted sleep><disturbed sleep><economic><enroll><experience><groupings><health care service use><health care service utilization><health determinants><healthcare service use><healthcare service utilization><healthcare utilization><homes><impaired sleep><improved><infancy><infantile><informal care><insight><intervention development><interventional strategy><irregular sleep><member><men><mental><negative affect><negative affectivity><parity><personal care><physical conditioning><physical health><physical symptom><population health><prospective><racial><racial background><racial origin><sleep disruption><sleep dysregulation><social><social determinants><social health determinants><social role><sociodeterminant><stress buffering><stress management><theories><therapy development><treatment development>,Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Depression; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Heart Disease; Mental Health; Social Determinants of Health
"IND-enabling safety and toxicity testing of a subcutaneous formulation of the PTP1B inhibitor MSI-1436, a novel strategy for treating fatal cardiomyopathy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients","IND-enabling safety and toxicity testing of a subcutaneous formulation of the PTP1B inhibitor MSI-1436, a novel strategy for treating fatal cardiomyopathy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients","PROJECT SUMMARY
 Heart failure caused by progressive dilated cardiomyopathy is the primary cause of death in
patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a fatal inherited muscle wasting disorder defined by
the FDA as an orphan disease. Cardiomyopathy is detectable in children as young as 10 years old and is
present in most patients by their late teens. Most DMD patients die in their late 20s from heart failure.
 There are no approved medications for DMD cardiomyopathy. Little effort has been devoted to
cardiomyopathy therapeutic development despite it being the main cause of DMD patient mortality. The vast
majority of DMD therapies in development focus on treating skeletal muscle degeneration. Current standard of
cardiac care for DMD patients utilizes steroids and off-label anti-hypertensive and heart failure drugs to reduce
heart inflammatory damage, workload, and tissue remodeling.
 Revidia Therapeutics, Inc. is a cardiac regenerative medicine company developing small molecules that
reactivate endogenous cardiac repair and regenerative processes. We are advancing a novel subcutaneous
formulation of our lead small molecule MSI-1436 into clinical trials as a treatment for DMD cardiomyopathy.
 MSI-1436 has already proven human safety. It functions by inhibiting the tyrosine phosphatase
PTP1B via a novel allosteric mechanism. PTP1B normally inactivates endogenous tissue repair and
regeneration processes. MSI-1436-induced inhibition of PTP1B reactivates these processes, which in turn
reverses tissue damage. Using blinded and randomized experimental and data analysis protocols, we have
shown that MSI-1436 stimulates heart muscle regeneration, improves heart function, and reduces infarct size
in wild type adult mice following myocardial infarction; improves left ventricle ejection fraction in a mouse
pressure overload dilated cardiomyopathy model; slows cardiac degenerative changes in young D2.B10-
Dmdmdx/J DMD mice; and improves left ventricle ejection fraction in aged DMD animals. Doses of MSI-1436
that reverse cardiac injury are up to 50-times lower than the maximum well tolerated human dose.
 Revidia has completed multiple IND-enabling workstreams including 1) FDA pre-IND meetings, 2)
efficacy testing in multiple animal models, 3) in vitro safety pharmacology, 4) ADME studies, 5) dose-range
finding, 6) CMC development and 7) Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) manufacturing. The final IND-enabling
workstream that must be completed is FDA-required GLP-compliant safety and toxicity testing of
subcutaneously administered MSI-1436. Proposed studies will validate subcutaneous MSI-1436 dose
formulations and bioanalytical methods and perform repeat dose toxicology and genotoxicity testing and CNS,
respiratory and cardiovascular safety pharmacology testing. Completion of these studies will allow IND
application submission in early 2025 and initiation of clinical trials later that year. Treatment of DMD
cardiomyopathy with MSI-1436 has significant potential to improve patient quality of life and prolong lifespan.","<0-11 years old><10 year old><10 years of age><21+ years old><ADME Study><Absorption,

Nourexal™: A Novel Bioenergetic Drug to Increase Donor Heart Utilization,Nourexal™: A Novel Bioenergetic Drug to Increase Donor Heart Utilization,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the U.S., over 20,000 heart transplants are needed each year, but fewer than 4,000 procedures are performed
despite the yearly availability of more than 12,000 donors. This gap exists because 6 hearts from every 10
organ donors are unused. The vast majority of eligible donor hearts are rejected because the transport time is
limited to 4 hours. To address this unmet need, Nour Heart developed and patented the bioenergetic
cardioprotective drug, Nourexal™ (Cyclocreatine Phosphate (CCrP)), which was recently granted FDA Orphan
Drug Designation for “Prevention of Ischemic Injury to Enhance Cardiac Graft Recovery and Survival in Heart
Transplantation” (DRU-2015-4951). CCrP enhances myocardial energy stores during ischemia, reduces cell
injury, inhibits inflammation and fibrosis, and restores normal cardiac function after extended cold storage of rat
and dog hearts. Further, injection of CCrP (1.2 gm/kg) into rat donors, protected hearts during harvesting and
allowed prolonged storage for 22 hours with full recovery of surgically grafted hearts for 3 days.
In this two-year Direct-to-Phase II SBIR project, Nour Heart, Inc. (NHI) will prepare and file an Investigational
New Drug (IND) for FDA approval to initiate CCrP Phase I safety trial in human healthy volunteers. Based on
the FDA response to NHI’s Pre-IND application (PIND 125867), we will: 1) produce Good Manufacturing Practice
(GMP) grade CCrP and determine its Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) (Aim 1); 2) conduct FDA-
recommended, IND-enabling CCrP preclinical safety studies in rats, dogs, and human unused cadaver donors
(UCDs) (Aim 2) (initial rat studies indicated that CCrP is a safe drug); 3) conduct a pilot in vivo efficacy study in
pigs to confirm the ability of CCrP to safely extend cold storage time of pig hearts to 6 hours before surgically
transplanting the graft into recipient pigs (Aim 3). This pig study will be overseen by Dr. O.H. Frazier at the Texas
Heart Institute to test the therapeutic benefits of our patented “three-step clinical protocol” where CCrP will be
administered only once to heart donors and not to recipients; and 4) prepare CCrP Phase I safety protocol,
investigational brochure, as well as assemble and file Nour Heart’s IND application to the FDA for an indication
for end-stage heart failure patients scheduled for heart transplantation procedures (Aim 4). We expect CCrP to
be safe in rats, dogs, and human unused cadaver donors and can preserve cardiac function in the pig heart
transplantation model. As a novel bioenergetic cardioprotective drug, CCrP will potentially increase the time and
distance that the hearts can be transported, thus extending transplantation to eligible recipient candidates
located outside the current 4-hour transport limit. Upon successful completion of this project, Nour Heart plans
to commercialize CCrP by raising capital to conduct CCrP Phase I safety trial, via two venture capital groups,
who have indicated interest, or to partner with Rallybio pharmaceuticals. Future broader use of CCrP that can
safely extend transport time (>4 hours), could significantly reduce the number of unused donor hearts & expand
supply of useable human donor hearts, thus, potentially increase heart transplant cases by over 3,000 yearly.",<Address><After Care><After-Treatment><Aftercare><Agreement><Animals><Apoptosis><Apoptosis Pathway><Bioenergetics><Biological Markers><Blood><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Blood Sample><Blood specimen><Body Tissues><Booklets><Brain Dead><Brain Death><Brochures><Cadaver><Canine Species><Canis familiaris><Capital><Cardiac><Cardiac Transplantation><Cellular injury><Chemistry><Clinical Pathology><Clinical Protocols><Coma Depasse><Common Rat Strains><Cryofixation><Cryopreservation><Dogs><Dogs Mammals><Dose><Drugs><ECG><EKG><Early-Stage Clinical Trials><Electrocardiogram><Electrocardiography><Eligibility><Eligibility Determination><FDA Drug Approval><Family suidae><Feasibility Studies><Fibrosis><Food and Drug Administration Drug Approval><Future><Good Manufacturing Process><Good manufacturing practice><Grant><Harvest><Health><Heart><Heart Grafting><Heart Transplantation><Heart failure><Hour><Human><IV Infusion><Inflammation><Injections><Intravenous infusion procedures><Investigational Drugs><Investigational New Drug Application><Investigational New Drugs><Ischemia><Legal patent><Letters><Measures><Medication><Modern Man><Myocardial><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Organ Donor><Organ Procurements><Orphan Drugs><Pamphlets><Patents><Patient Schedules><Patients><Pharmaceutical Agent><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Pharmaceuticals><Pharmacologic Substance><Pharmacological Substance><Phase><Phase 1 Clinical Trials><Phase I Clinical Trials><Phosphates><Pigs><Pilot Projects><Prevention><Procedures><Programmed Cell Death><Protocol><Protocol Screening><Protocols documentation><Rat><Rats Mammals><Rattus><Recommendation><Recovery><SBIR><Safety><Sales><Saline><Saline Solution><Sampling><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Suidae><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><Swine><System><Testing><Texas><Therapeutic><Time><Tissues><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Transplantation><Transplantation Surgery><acute toxicity><aged><bio-markers><biologic marker><biomarker><cadaveric><cadavers><canine><cardiac failure><cardiac function><cardiac graft><cardiac preservation><cardioprotectant><cardioprotection><cardioprotective><cell damage><cell injury><cellular damage><cerebral death><cold preservation><cold storage><commercialization><damage to cells><design><designing><domestic dog><drug safety><drug/agent><efficacy study><function of the heart><healthy volunteer><heart function><heart preservation><heart transplant><in vivo><injury to cells><inorganic phosphate><interest><intravenous infusion><ischemia injury><ischemic injury><manufacture><medication safety><metabolic profile><novel><pharmaceutical><pharmaceutical safety><phase 1 trial><phase I protocol><phase I trial><pilot study><porcine><post treatment><pre-clinical safety><pre-clinical study><preclinical safety><preclinical study><response><safety study><suid><surgery><therapeutic evaluation><therapeutic testing><transplant><transplant model>,Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Organ Transplantation; Transplantation
"A novel long-acting conjugate of the vasodilative hormone, human brain natriuretic peptide (hBNP), to treat resistant hypertension","A novel long-acting conjugate of the vasodilative hormone, human brain natriuretic peptide (hBNP), to treat resistant hypertension","SUMMARY
 Hypertension affects one-third of US adults (68-88 million cases), contributing to >500,000 deaths per year
and healthcare expenses of $51-131 billion annually. Despite the availability of myriad FDA-approved drugs to
lower blood pressure, 15-20% of patients are resistant to treatment, and many more patients are unresponsive
because of non-adherence to their medication schedule. With an aging population and the increasing prevalence
of hypertension, effective treatment for hypertension is likely to become progressively more critical.
 Human brain natriuretic peptide (hBNP) potently lowers blood pressure. hBNP is produced by the heart in
response to high blood pressure, leading to vasodilation, excretion of salt and water in the urine, and inhibition
of certain enzymes that raise blood pressure. The safety and effectiveness of hBNP as a therapeutic (aka
nesiritide, Natrecor®) were proven for short-term use, but it must be given by constant intravenous infusion or
multiple suboptimal daily injections, because it is rapidly removed from the blood. Sale of Natrecor® was
discontinued by the manufacturer in 2018 due to decreasing sales after it was shown that a short-term infusion
of the acute-acting endogenous peptide had no beneficial effect on reducing long-term rehospitalization or death.
Antlia Bioscience has resolved the issue that previously impeded the long-term effectiveness of Natrecor®
 Antlia Bioscience has discovered an innovative method to extend the lifespan of hBNP in the blood, while
keeping its ability to lower blood pressure without increasing heart rate. Antlia has added a block of 200 units of
the three amino acids—Proline-Alanine-Serine, PAS(200)—to the hBNP peptide, creating a large molecule that
resists degradation and elimination from the blood. Importantly, dogs treated with PAS(200)-hBNP demonstrated
significant and sustained blood pressure lowering after a single injection, with minimal adverse side effects.
Subsequently three additional hBNP compounds have been made with 400, 600, and 800 PAS units, which were
shown to produce progressively longer and higher plasma exposure in a rat pharmacokinetic study. The
PAS(400)-hBNP analog is anticipated to be suitable for up to 2x monthly dosing in humans, while the PAS(600)
and PAS(800) analogs could provide once monthly or longer dosing intervals. For first proof-of-concept studies
designed to establish safety and efficacy in patients, we will use the PAS(400)-hBNP product with an anticipated
>72-hour half-life in humans. In preparation for human studies, this Direct-to-Phase-II proposal will pursue bulk
manufacture of clinical-grade PAS(400)-hBNP with formulation and stability studies (Aim 1). The first non-clinical
batch of the compound made during manufacturing process development will be used for dose-range-finding
PK/PD studies in rats and dogs with the goal of defining the therapeutic range of doses with associated plasma
concentrations over time (Aim 2). From the results of Aim 2, the doses and frequency of dosing will be selected
for the testing of safety of the clinical grade material in rat and dog GLP-toxicity studies (Aim 3) and in a
cardiovascular safety study in dogs (Aim 4).","<21+ years old><Active Follow-up><Acute><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Adverse Experience><Adverse effects><Adverse event><Affect><Aging><Agonist><Alanine><Amino Acids><Angiotensin-Forming Enzyme><Angiotensinogenase><Angiotensins><Animals><Anti-Hypertensive Agents><Anti-Hypertensive Drugs><Anti-Hypertensives><Assay><BNP Gene Product><BNP-32><BP reduction><Bioassay><Biologic Sciences><Biological Assay><Biological Sciences><Bioscience><Blood><Blood Plasma><Blood Pressure><Blood Pressure Monitors><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Bolus><Bolus Infusion><Brain Natriuretic Peptide-32><Brain natriuretic peptide><Canine Species><Canis familiaris><Cardiac Chronotropism><Cardiac Failure Congestive><Cardiac Ventricles><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Cell Body><Cells><Cessation of life><Chronic><Clinical><Clinical Evaluation><Clinical Testing><Congestive Heart Failure><Continuous Sphygmomanometers><Cyclic GMP><Data><Death><Dogs><Dogs Mammals><Dose><Drug Kinetics><Drug resistance><Drugs><ECG><EKG><Effectiveness><Electrocardiogram><Electrocardiography><Endocrine Gland Secretion><Endothelium><Enzyme Gene><Enzymes><Excretory function><FDA approved><Female><Formulation><Frequencies><Future><GMP lots><Goals><Guanosine Cyclic Monophosphate><Half-Life><Healthcare><Heart><Heart Decompensation><Heart Rate><Heart Vascular><Heart Ventricle><Heart failure><Hormones><Hour><Human><Hydrogen Oxide><Hypertension><Hypotensive Agent><Hypotensive Drugs><IV Infusion><IV bolus><Increase lifespan><Infusion><Infusion procedures><Injections><Intravenous Bolus><Intravenous infusion procedures><Kidney><Kidney Urinary System><L-Proline><L-Serine><Life Sciences><Manufactured Materials><Manufacturer><Measures><Mediating><Medication><Methods><Modern Man><Monitor><NOAEL><Natrecor><Natriuretic Factor-32><Nesiritide><No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level><Patients><Peptides><Permeability><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Pharmacodynamics><Pharmacokinetics><Phase><Phase 1b Trial><Phase Ib Trial><Plasma><Plasma Serum><Preparation><Prevalence><Production><Proline><Recovery><Renin><Research Design><Resistance><Resistant Hypertension><Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma><Safety><Sales><Schedule><Serine><Sodium Chloride><Study Type><Subcutaneous Injections><Subgroup><System><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Hormone><Time><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Toxicokinetics><Toxicology><Transfection><Type-B Natriuretic Peptide><Urine><Validation><Vascular Hypertensive Disease><Vascular Hypertensive Disorder><Vasodilatation><Vasodilation><Vasorelaxation><Water><Work><active followup><adulthood><aged group><aged groups><aged individual><aged individuals><aged people><aged person><aged persons><aged population><aged populations><aging population><aminoacid><analog><anti-hypertension><assay development><blood pressure reduction><brain Natriuretic factor><cGMP><cGMP production><canine><cardiac failure><chronic heart failure><circulatory system><clinical candidate><clinical test><commercial scale manufacturing><commercialization><design><designing><domestic dog><dosage><drug resistant><drug/agent><effective therapy><effective treatment><elongating the lifespan><excretion><extend life span><extend lifespan><first in man><first-in-human><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><good manufacturing practice lot><health care><high blood pressure><hospital re-admission><hospital readmission><hyperpiesia><hyperpiesis><hypertension treatment><hypertensive><hypertensive disease><hypertensive disorder><infusions><innovate><innovation><innovative><intravenous infusion><lifespan extension><lower BP><lower blood pressure><lowers blood pressure><male><manufacture><manufacturing process development><manufacturing ramp-up><manufacturing scale-up><novel><patient population><peptide analog><population aging><preparations><re-admission><re-hospitalization><readmission><reduce BP><reduce blood pressure><reduction in BP><reduction in blood pressure><rehospitalization><renal><research clinical testing><resistance to Drug><resistance to therapy><resistant><resistant to Drug><resistant to therapy><response><safety study><safety testing><salt><scale up batch><scale up production><sex><side effect><study design><subcutaneous><subdermal><subdermal injection><therapeutic resistance><therapy resistant><treatment resistance><upscale manufacturing><validations>",Aging; Biotechnology; Cardiovascular; Hypertension; Patient Safety
Novel oral small molecules for progressive pulmonary fibrosis,Novel oral small molecules for progressive pulmonary fibrosis,"Abstract
 The overall goal of this program is the development and commercialization of a novel, safer, and more
effective, therapy for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a progressive and generally
fatal disease for which there is no cure. IPF has a median survival rate of 3-5 years, which is less than most
cancers. There are approximately 100,000 people in the US with IPF with 30,000 – 40,000 new cases per year.
As many as 40,000 Americans die each year from IPF. The two FDA approved drugs for IPF, pirfenidone and
nintedanib, only slow disease progression, have side effects which limit their use, and do not improve mortality.
Clearly, there is a significant need for therapies to treat this devastating disease. Additionally, there are several
other causes of progressive pulmonary fibrosis including connective tissue-associated interstitial lung disease
(ILD), fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis and sarcoidosis for which new antifibrotics are required.
 IPF is characterized by excessive collagen deposition by activated myofibroblasts in the lung. NovoMedix
has developed a novel series of small molecules that inhibit myofibroblast activation and differentiation and can
also convert activated fibroblasts back to their quiescent state, potentially reversing fibrotic damage. NM novel
compounds inhibit IL-11 secretion by activated fibroblasts and epithelial cells and act as allosteric AMP Kinase
(AMPK) agonists. NovoMedix drug candidates decrease fibrosis and inflammation in two different bleomycin
models of pulmonary fibrosis. They also decrease fibrosis and inflammation in a liver fibrosis model; prevent
heart failure in mouse transverse aortic constriction (TAC) models; and prevent doxorubicin-induced
cardiomyopathy in mouse cancer models. IL-11 and AMPK play key roles in fibrosis and inflammation, and
activation of AMPK has been shown to be cardioprotective. However, the role of inflammation in IPF is unclear,
and there is widespread agreement that the bleomycin mode of lung fibrosis in mice has limitations as a
translational model.
 We have also identified new NM compounds that lower IC50s and better oral availability, which we believe
will be superior drug development candidates. Our hypothesis is that one or more of these compounds will
reduce lung fibrosis and block pro-fibrotic feedforward loops, reducing disease progression and improving
outcomes. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Confirm efficacy in novel cell assays including
physiologically relevant stretch and 3D models, and select lead candidates, 2) Scale-up production of lead
candidates for animal studies, and 3) Demonstrate efficacy in the TGF- model of progressive pulmonary fibrosis,
which has some key advantages over the bleomycin model. These studies will pave the way for trials in lung
fibrosis patients.",<14-Hydroxydaunomycin><3-D modeling><3D modeling><AMP Kinase><ATP-AMP Phosphotransferase><ATP-AMP Transphosphorylase><Adenylokinase><Adriamycine><Agonist><Agreement><American><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Animal Testing><Animals><Back><Besnier-Boeck Disease><Bleo><Bleomycin><Body Tissues><Boeck's Sarcoid><Bone-Derived Transforming Growth Factor><Cancer Model><CancerModel><Cancers><Cardiomyopathies><Cell Culture Techniques><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cellular Assay><Cold-Insoluble Globulins><Collagen><Connective Tissue><Cyclicity><Deposit><Deposition><Development><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Dorsum><Doxorubicin><Doxorubicina><Drugs><ECM><Epithelial Cells><Esbriet><Extracellular Matrix><Extrinsic allergic alveolitis><FDA approved><FN1><Fibroblasts><Fibronectin 1><Fibronectins><Fibrosing Alveolitis><Fibrosis><Future><Gel><Goals><Heart failure><Histology><Hydroxyl Daunorubicin><Hydroxyldaunorubicin><Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis><IL-11><IL11><Immunoblotting><In Vitro><Inflammation><Inspiratory Capacity><Interleukin-11><Ionizing Electromagnetic Radiation><Ionizing radiation><LETS Proteins><Large External Transformation-Sensitive Protein><Lead><Liver Fibrosis><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Lung Tissue Fibrosis><Lung damage><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Medication><Messenger RNA><Mice><Mice Mammals><Milk Growth Factor><Modeling><Murine><Mus><Myocardial Diseases><Myocardial Disorder><Myocardiopathies><Myofibroblast><Myokinase><Ofev><Opsonic Glycoprotein><Opsonic alpha(2)SB Glycoprotein><Oral><Patients><Pb element><Periodicity><Persons><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phase><Phenotype><Physiologic><Physiological><Pirfenidone><Platelet Transforming Growth Factor><Play><Prevention><Production><Proliferating><Proteins><Pulmonary Fibrosis><Radiation-Ionizing Total><Research><Resistance><Respiratory Epithelium><Rhythmicity><Role><SBIR><Sarcoidosis><Schaumann's Disease><Series><Silicosis><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Standard Model><Stretching><Structure of respiratory epithelium><Survival Rate><TGF B><TGF-beta><TGF-β><TGFbeta><TGFβ><Tissues><Transforming Growth Factor beta><Transforming Growth Factor-Beta Family Gene><Western Blotting><Western Immunoblotting><adenylate kinase><airway epithelium><allergic pneumonitis><alpha 2-Surface Binding Glycoprotein><aorta constriction><cardiac failure><cardioprotectant><cardioprotection><cardioprotective><cell assay><cell culture><cell cultures><commercial scale manufacturing><commercialization><developmental><diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis><drug candidate><drug development><drug/agent><fibrosing interstitial lung disease><fibrosis in the lung><fibrotic interstitial lung disease><fibrotic liver><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><hepatic fibrosis><idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis><improved outcome><in vivo><interest><ionizing output><lead candidate><lung fibrosis><lung function><lung histology><lung injury><lung repair><lung tissue repair><mRNA><malignancy><manufacturing ramp-up><manufacturing scale-up><model of animal><mortality><mouse model><murine model><myocardium disease><myocardium disorder><neoplasm/cancer><nintedanib><novel><prevent><preventing><programs><protein blotting><pulmonary><pulmonary damage><pulmonary function><pulmonary histology><pulmonary injury><pulmonary repair><pulmonary tissue damage><pulmonary tissue injury><resistant><respiratory tract epithelium><scale up><scale up batch><scale up production><side effect><small molecule><social role><three-dimensional modeling><translational model><upscale manufacturing>,Biotechnology; Cancer; Lung; Orphan Drug; Prevention; Pulmonary Fibrosis; Rare Diseases
General Capillary to Arterial Endothelial Cell Transition in Pulmonary ArterialHypertension,General Capillary to Arterial Endothelial Cell Transition in Pulmonary ArterialHypertension,"Project Summary
 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by a progressive increase of pulmonary
vascular resistance and obliterative pulmonary vascular remodeling that result in right heart hypertrophy,
failure, and premature death. The underlying mechanisms of loss of capillary endothelial cells (ECs) and
obliterative vascular lesion formation remain unclear. Our preliminary data showed that arterial
programing was evident in human PAH patients and rodents. We hypothesize that general capillary ECs
program to arterial ECs through HIF-2α-Cdk19/Sox17/Notch4 signaling which contributes to the
pathogenesis of PAH. Completing our proposed study will provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the
effective treatment of PAH in patients.",<Architecture><Arteries><Attenuated><Autoregulation><Blood Vessels><Blood capillaries><Body Tissues><CRISPR><CRISPR/Cas system><CXCL12><CXCL12 gene><CXCL12 protein><Capillary Endothelial Cell><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cessation of life><Chemokine (C-X-C Motif) Ligand 12><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats><Complex><Data><Death><Development><Disease><Disorder><Endothelial Cells><Endothelium><Engineering / Architecture><Exhibits><Expectancy><F8VWF><Failure><Gases><Genes><Genetic><Glycolysis><Goals><Guide RNA><Heart Hypertrophy><Homeostasis><Human><Hypertension><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><KO mice><Knock-out Mice><Knockout Mice><Leanness><Lesion><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Mediating><Mediator><Mesenchymal><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><Murine><Mus><Null Mouse><Nutrient><O element><O2 element><Organ><Oxygen><PBSF><Pathogenesis><Patients><Phenotype><Physiological Homeostasis><Population><Pre-B Cell Growth Stimulating Factor><Progenitor Cells><Progressive Disease><Proliferating><Pulmonary Vascular Resistance><Reporter><Research><Rodent><Rodentia><Rodents Mammals><Role><SCYB12><SDF-1><SDF-1A><SDF-1B><SDF-1alpha><SDF1><SDF1A><SDF1B><SOX17><SOX17 gene><SRY-Related HMG-Box Gene 17><Sdf1 protein><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Specific qualifier value><Specified><Stromal Cell-Derived Factor 1><TLSF-A><TLSF-B><TPAR1><Thinness><Tissues><Up-Regulation><Upregulation><VWF gene><Vascular Hypertensive Disease><Vascular Hypertensive Disorder><Venous><attenuate><attenuates><biological signal transduction><capillary><cardiac hypertrophy><developmental><effective therapy><effective treatment><endothelial dysfunction><gRNA><hIRH><high blood pressure><hyperpiesia><hyperpiesis><hypertensive disease><hypertensive disorder><iPS><iPSC><iPSCs><idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension><idiopathic pulmonary hypertension><impaired pulmonary vascularization><induced pluripotent cell><induced pluripotent stem cell><inducible pluripotent stem cell><knock-down><knockdown><lung vascular disease><lung vascular remodeling><mortality><mouse model><murine model><nano particle><nano-sized particle><nanoparticle><nanosized particle><new drug target><new druggable target><new marker><new pharmacotherapy target><new therapeutic approach><new therapeutic intervention><new therapeutic strategies><new therapeutic target><new therapy approaches><new therapy target><new treatment approach><new treatment strategy><notch><notch protein><notch receptors><novel><novel biomarker><novel drug target><novel druggable target><novel marker><novel pharmacotherapy target><novel therapeutic approach><novel therapeutic intervention><novel therapeutic strategies><novel therapeutic target><novel therapy approach><novel therapy target><pharmacologic><premature><prematurity><preservation><primary pulmonary hypertension><programs><pulmonary><pulmonary arterial hypertension><pulmonary artery hypertension><pulmonary vascular disease><pulmonary vascular disorder><pulmonary vascular dysfunction><pulmonary vascular remodeling><pulmonary vasculopathy><repair><repaired><right heart failure><right sided heart failure><right ventricle failure><right ventricular failure><right ventricular heart failure><scRNA-seq><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single-cell RNA sequencing><social role><stem cells><stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha><therapeutically effective><treatment strategy><vWF><vascular>,Lung; Pulmonary Hypertension; Rare Diseases
Efficient low flow pump for pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,Efficient low flow pump for pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,"Project Summary
The goal of this STTR proposal submission is to develop a new extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
(ECMO) pump designed to efficiently accommodate the low flow rates needed for pediatric and neonatal
patients. In smaller pediatric patients including toddlers and neonates we need ECMO pumps that can operate
at lower blood flow rates to avoid the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis), shear stress, and platelet
activation. For this project, based on the needs of our neonatal intensive care unit and carbon dioxide removal,
we propose to design, develop, and test a low-flow pump that can operate from 0.05 to 0.5 L/min (equivalent to
50 to 500 cc/min) for use in our neonatal patients and patients who require carbon dioxide removal. This flow
rate is an order of magnitude less than current pump designs and should significantly reduce hemolysis and
other centrifugal pump effects.
 Aim 1 – Pump Modelling, Design, and Construction: the pump design will be created to meet the flow rate
specifications of 0.05 to 0.5 L/min. Dr. Wu and his team at the University of Maryland will utilize computational
fluid modeling (CFD) to develop the pump with the optimal geometry parameters, such as impeller size and
volute diameter to provide high efficiency and good biocompatibility (low hemolysis and thrombosis potential).
Milestone: system bench tested for proper operation at low flow rates using distilled water.
 Aim 2 – Evaluate the Device through Comparative Blood Flow Testing: tests will be conducted within the
research laboratories at Children’s National to compare the performance of the new device to the current
standard-of-care pump models. These tests will examine the flow of blood through each pump at different
designated rates and measure the index of hemolysis based on plasma free hemoglobin (PFH) levels.
Milestone: hemolysis reduced by 20% at low flow rates compared to current models.","<0-11 years old><21+ years old><Abscission><Adult><Adult Human><Airway failure><Animals><Aorta><Assistive Technology><Back><Biomedical Engineering><Blood><Blood Cells><Blood Plasma><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Blood Volume><Blood erythrocyte><Blood flow><Businesses><CO2><Carbon Dioxide><Carbonic Anhydride><Cardiopulmonary><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Child><Child Youth><Childhood><Children (0-21)><Circulation><Clinical><Clinical Management><Clinical Trials><Computer Models><Computerized Models><Consultations><Critical Care><Dedications><Development><Devices><Diameter><Doctor of Philosophy><Dorsum><Drops><Engineering><Erythrocytes><Erythrocytic><Excision><Extirpation><Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation><Geometry><Goals><Heart><Heart Vascular><Hematologist><Hemoglobin concentration result><Hemolysis><Hospitals><Hydrogen Oxide><Intercept><Laboratory Research><Lead><Life><Liquid substance><Marrow erythrocyte><Maryland><Measures><Medical><Modeling><Neonatal Intensive Care Units><Neonatology><Newborn Intensive Care Units><O element><O2 element><Output><Oxygen><Oxygenators><Patients><Pb element><Pediatric Surgery><Pediatric Surgical Procedures><Pediatrics><Performance><Peripheral Blood Cell><Ph.D.><PhD><Plasma><Plasma Serum><Platelet Activation><Population><Principal Investigator><Prognosis><Pump><QOL><Quality of life><Red Blood Cells><Red Cell><Removal><Respiratory Failure><Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma><Rupture><STTR><Safety><Self-Help Devices><Small Business Technology Transfer Research><Specific qualifier value><Specified><Surgical Removal><System><Testing><Thrombosis><Toddler><Training><Tube><Universities><Venous><Washington><Water><Work><adulthood><assisted device><assistive device><base><bases><bio-engineered><bio-engineers><biocompatibility><bioengineering><biological engineering><biomaterial compatibility><blood corpuscles><blood pump><child patients><circulatory system><comparative><computational modeling><computational models><computer based models><computerized modeling><consultation><design><designing><developmental><erythrolysis><experience><fluid><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><hemoglobin level><improved><improved outcome><indexing><innovate><innovation><innovative><kids><liquid><medical college><medical schools><multidisciplinary><neonatal ICU><neonatal patient><neonate><operation><operations><pediatric><pediatric patients><prevent><preventing><professor><programs><prototype><resection><school of medicine><shear stress><standard of care><thrombotic disease><thrombotic disorder><tool><youngster>",Assistive Technology; Bioengineering; Cardiovascular; Hematology; Pediatric
Substance P Metabolites and Receptors in the Pathogenesis of Cardiac Disease in Type 1 Diabetes,Substance P Metabolites and Receptors in the Pathogenesis of Cardiac Disease in Type 1 Diabetes,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). A key cardiovascular
outcome is left ventricular remodeling in the form of concentric hypertrophy, fibrosis, and vascular remodeling.
This results in diastolic dysfunction and eventual heart failure. There are no specific therapies for this adverse
remodeling in T1D, therefore, progress in the prevention or regression of this condition requires identification of
new treatment approaches. In T1D and T2D there is a loss of the 11 amino acid sensory nerve neuropeptide
substance P (SP). Using an animal model of T2D, we identified that replacement of lost SP provides protection
against cardiac fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction via activation of the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK-1R). We have
subsequently determined that many C-terminal metabolites of SP retain biological activity at the NK-1R, and
further determined that a mimetic of the SP metabolite SP7-11, which activates the NK-1R, prevents cardiac
fibrosis and restores normal cardiac function in T2D mice. Thus, SP and SP metabolites that activate the NK-1R
are cardioprotective in diabetes. Further, we have identified that the N-terminal SP metabolite SP1-9, does not
activate the NK-1R but instead is active at the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 (MrgprX2). This is
significant because MrgprX2 is found almost exclusively on mast cells and mast cells contribute to adverse
cardiac remodeling, particularly fibrosis. Thus, SP1-9 and MrgprX2 would be predicted to promote adverse
cardiac remodeling. Therefore, the current project will utilize fixed and frozen cardiac tissue, plasma, and fixed
and frozen coronary vessel tissue to assess SP metabolites, SP receptors, SP metabolizing enzymes, mast
cells, fibrosis, as well as available clinical parameters to determine the extent to which cardioprotective and
adverse cardiac remodeling-promoting molecules and cells are present in the T1D heart. These parameters will
be compared with T2D and non-diabetic hearts. We will also correlate: 1) the assessed parameters with
fibrosis/vascular remodeling as primary outcomes; 2) the assessed parameters with each other as secondary
outcomes; and 3) the assessed parameters with available clinical data as tertiary outcomes. Emphasis will be
placed on the association between SP and SP metabolites with the aforementioned outcomes. Our overall
hypothesis is that T1D results in low SP levels, cardiac and coronary vascular remodeling and reduced cardiac
function from either decreased neuronal SP production and less NK-1R activation or SP metabolism giving high
SP1-9 levels and activation of MrgprX2. We will test our hypothesis using three specific aims: 1) Determine SP,
SP metabolites and neuronal SP content in the T1D heart and plasma; 2) Determine SP metabolizing peptidases,
NK-1R, MrgprX2, MCs, fibrosis and vascular remodeling in the T1D heart; and 3) Determine the relationship

heart. These studies will provide new insights into the role of SP and SP metabolites in the human heart in T1D

Sleep and Circadian Contributions to Nighttime Blood Pressure Rhythms (SCN-BP),Sleep and Circadian Contributions to Nighttime Blood Pressure Rhythms (SCN-BP),"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dysregulated sleep and circadian disruption are common among adults in the United States. An estimated 30-50% of
adults endorse some form of sleep-related problem, such as short sleep duration (<6 hours/night), poor sleep quality,
presence of insomnia symptoms, or an early or late chronotype (i.e., preference for certain sleep and wake time) that is
at odds with the dominant societal social clock. These sleep problems are being increasingly implicated as significant
contributors to lower cardiovascular health (CVH) and thus subsequently higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity
and mortality. For example, short sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and evening chronotype are associated with a
number of components to CVH, including obesity, diabetes, and lower diet quality. Consequently, these same sleep-
related factors are associated with a higher risk for new-onset CVD, including coronary heart disease and heart failure.
There are significant health disparities for sleep health, CVH, and CVD. Dysregulated sleep, poorer CVH, and higher CVD
morbidity and mortality are disproportionately distributed across populations, with individuals of non-white
racial/ethnic groups and those overly burdened by socio-, economic-, and environmental disadvantage faring the worst.
Despite these parallel problems among the same populations and the significant extant literature on the sleep-CVD
association, there is a dearth of research on potential ways in which sleep disparities contribute to CVH and CVD
disparities and how to simultaneously address both of these connected problems.
Therefore, the overall research-related goal of this two-year Diversity Supplement proposal is to address the current
need for research on the intersection of sleep and CVD disparities in diverse populations through the following aims: 1)
determine associations of sleep factors, chronotype, and chronotype-sleep timing alignment with left ventricular mass
index, 2) determine associations of sleep factors, chronotype, and chronotype-sleep timing alignment with potential
behavioral (physical activity, diet quality, alcohol use, smoking) and biological (cortisol) mechanisms, and 3) determine
whether these associations differ by individual- and geocoded, community-level social determinants of health. In parallel
to this research, the overall training-related goal of this Supplement is to support Dr. Brittanny Polanka, PhD in receiving
necessary mentorship and career development guidance to become an independent, extramurally-funded principal
investigator in the field of cardiovascular behavioral medicine. In collaboration with a mentorship team including the
expertise of Drs. S. Justin Thomas, Marwah Abdalla, and Mercedes Carnethon, an individualized career development
plan has been created to address mentee training gaps in measurement and processing of objective sleep and circadian
data, use of subclinical assessment markers derived from echocardiography, and methodological and statistical
approaches in sleep and CVD disparities research. Completion of the proposed research aims and training objectives will
serve as the foundation upon which Dr. Polanka will prepare a K career development application to further her career
trajectory towards independence.","<21+ years old><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Aeroseb-HC><Affect><Alcohol Drinking><Alcohol consumption><Area><Arrhythmia><Behavioral><Behavioral Medicine><Biological><Biological Markers><Black><Black race><Blood Pressure><Blood Pressure Monitors><Body Temperature><Cardiac Arrhythmia><Cardiac infarction><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Diseases><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Cetacort><Circadian Dysregulation><Collaborations><Communities><Continuous Sphygmomanometers><Coronary Disease><Coronary heart disease><Cort-Dome><Cortef><Cortenema><Cortisol><Cortispray><Cortril><Data><Dermacort><Detection><Development Plans><Diabetes Mellitus><Diet><Disadvantaged><Disparities><Disparity><Disparity population><Doctor of Philosophy><EXTMR><Echocardiogram><Echocardiography><Economics><Eldecort><EtOH drinking><EtOH use><Ethnic Group><Ethnic Origin><Ethnic People><Ethnic Population><Ethnic individual><Ethnicity><Ethnicity People><Ethnicity Population><Event><Exhibits><Extramural><Extramural Activities><Female><Foundations><Funding><Future><Goals><Health><Heart Arrhythmias><Heart Vascular><Heart failure><High Prevalence><Hispanic><Hour><Hydrocortisone><Hydrocortone><Hypertension><Hytone><Incidence><Individual><Insomnia><Insomnia Disorder><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Investigators><Knowledge><LV Mass><Left Ventricular Mass><Literature><Los Angeles><Measurement><Measures><Melatonin><Mendelian randomization><Mentorship><Methodology><Morbidity><Morbidity -

Multi-omic dissection of clonal hematopoiesis-associated diseases,Multi-omic dissection of clonal hematopoiesis-associated diseases,"Project Summary
Self-renewing cell populations accumulate somatic mutations with aging and/or in response to environmental
insult and chronic inflammation. Most of these mutations in normal tissues have no functional consequence. In
rare cases, these somatic mutations can confer a selective advantage leading to clonal expansion in
hematopoietic stem cells, a phenomenon termed 'Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential' (CHIP).
CHIP has been associated with a selective range of non-hematopoietic conditions, including coronary artery
disease, stroke, heart failure, venous thromboembolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic liver
diseases, and osteoporosis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which CHIP specifically promotes these
diseases remain largely unknown. The overarching goal of this proposal is to molecularly connect CHIP with
the development of associated diseases through developing and applying statistical and machine learning
methods to multi-omics data in the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed), UK Biobank, and
Mass General Brigham Biobank (MGBB). Specifically, I propose the following aims. In Aim 1, I will develop a
statistical method that combines multiple proteins implicated in the same pathway to improve discovery and
facilitate translational insights for proteomics-based association analyses. The combined protein quantitative
traits generated by this method will be used in the following aims. In Aim 2, I will examine how the presence of
CHIP and each CHIP driver gene specifically promote certain diseases through (1) identifying the proteomic
signatures of CHIP and quantifying the mediation effects to associated diseases and (2) evaluating the
potential modifications of CHIP-associated diseases by the expression levels of genes implicated in diverse
molecular factors. In Aim 3, I will evaluate how the progression of CHIP promotes associated diseases. I will
examine associations between longitudinal change in the number and size of CHIP clones and incident
disease risks, as well as generate bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data among CHIP carriers with or
without osteoporosis, a disease strongly associated with CHIP but understudied, and test for differential gene
expressions between the two groups. This project's successful execution will identify the mechanisms
underlying CHIP-associated disease risks to prioritize therapeutic targets and advance precision medicine
goals.","<21+ years old><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Aging><Apoplexy><Attention><B cell differentiation factor><B cell stimulating factor 2><B-Cell Differentiation Factor><B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2><B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2><BCDF><BSF-2><BSF2><Beta Proprotein Interleukin 1><Biological Function><Biological Process><Blood><Blood Diseases><Blood Precursor Cell><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Brain Vascular Accident><COPD><Cardiac infarction><Cerebral Stroke><Cerebrovascular Apoplexy><Cerebrovascular Stroke><Chronic><Chronic Disease><Chronic Illness><Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease><Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease><Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease><Clonal Expansion><Coronary Arteriosclerosis><Coronary Artery Disease><Coronary Artery Disorder><Coronary Atherosclerosis><DNA><DNMT3a><Data><Deoxyribonucleic Acid><Development><Differential Gene Expression><Disease><Disorder><Dissection><Expression Signature><Gene Expression><Gene Expression Profile><Genes><Genetic><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic defect><Genomics><Germ Lines><Goals><HPGF><Heart failure><Hematologic Diseases><Hematological Disease><Hematological Disorder><Hematopoiesis><Hematopoietic Cellular Control Mechanisms><Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells><Hematopoietic stem cells><Hepatic Disorder><Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor><Hybridoma Growth Factor><IFN-beta 2><IFNB2><IL-1 beta><IL-1 β><IL-1-b><IL-1β><IL-6><IL1-Beta><IL1-β><IL1B Protein><IL1F2><IL1β><IL6 Protein><Immune><Immunes><Individual><Inflammasome><Inflammation><Interleukin 1beta><Interleukin-1 beta><Interleukin-1β><Interleukin-6><Lead><Liver diseases><MGI-2><Measures><Mediating><Mediation><Methods><Modeling><Modification><Molecular><Multiomic Data><Mutation><Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein><Myocardial Infarct><Myocardial Infarction><NHLBI><National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute><Negotiating><Negotiation><Network Analysis><Normal Tissue><Normal tissue morphology><Osteoporosis><Participant><Pathologic><Pathway Analysis><Pathway interactions><Pb element><Phase><Plasma Proteins><Plasmacytoma Growth Factor><Population><Preinterleukin 1 Beta><Proteins><Proteomics><Proxy><RNA Seq><RNA sequencing><RNAseq><Risk><Sampling><Somatic Mutation><Statistical Methods><Stroke><Structure><TOPMed><Testing><Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression><Tissue-Specific Gene Expression><Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine><Work><adulthood><age associated><age correlated><age dependent><age linked><age related><age specific><atherosclerotic coronary disease><biobank><biorepository><blood cell formation><blood cell progenitor><blood disorder><blood progenitor><blood stem cell><blood-forming stem cell><brain attack><cardiac failure><cardiac infarct><cell type><cerebral vascular accident><cerebrovascular accident><chronic disorder><chronic hepatic disease><chronic hepatic disorder><chronic liver disease><chronic liver disorder><chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder><coronary arterial disease><coronary attack><coronary infarct><coronary infarction><deep learning><deep learning method><deep learning strategy><developmental><dimension reduction><dimensionality reduction><disease phenotype><disease risk><disorder risk><early onset><gene expression pattern><gene expression signature><genome mutation><hDNA methyltransferase 3a><heart attack><heart infarct><heart infarction><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><hematopoietic progenitor><hematopoietic stem progenitor cell><hemopoietic progenitor><hemopoietic stem cell><hepatic disease><hepatopathy><improved><individualized strategies><insight><instrument><interferon beta 2><liver disorder><machine learning based method><machine learning method><machine learning methodologies><machine statistical learning><multiomics><multiple omic data><multiple omics><panomics><pathway><personalized strategies><precision medicine><precision-based medicine><prevent><preventing><protein protein interaction><proteomic signature><reduce data dimension><reduce dimensionality><response><scRNA-seq><self renewing cell><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single-cell RNA sequencing><somatic variant><statistic methods><statistical and machine learning><stroked><strokes><therapeutic target><trait><transcriptional profile><transcriptional signature><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing><transcriptomics><venous thromboembolism>",Aging; Cardiovascular; Genetics; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease; Hematology; Human Genome; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Osteoporosis; Precision Medicine
Xenon MRI in Pulmonary Hypertension,Xenon MRI in Pulmonary Hypertension,"ABSTRACT
The diagnosis and follow-up of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) continues to be challenging,
with a lack of unambiguous biomarkers that reflect the course of the disease. PAH is characterized by pulmonary
vascular remodeling with abnormal cellular proliferation and fibrosis. This leads to an obstructive vasculopathy
of the pulmonary arterioles, resulting in pulmonary hypertension (PH) and progressive right heart failure that lead
to morbidity and mortality. Hemodynamics and right heart function are commonly used to diagnose disease and
monitor progression and response to therapy. However, these readouts are altered in other common heart and
lung diseases and their changes are not specific to pulmonary vascular remodeling. This lack of specificity has
resulted in critical unmet need for noninvasive approaches for directly monitoring pulmonary vascular remodeling
in PAH that could be used to guide treatment in patients, thereby improving their health outcomes. To address
this need, we have developed 129Xe magnetic resonance imaging (129Xe MRI) as a method to produce
quantitative 3D maps of gas transfer across the pulmonary blood-gas barrier. 129Xe MRI has a distinct PAH
signature and can simultaneously measure capillary blood volume and hemodynamic changes associated with
pulmonary vascular remodeling. The objective of this project is to associate pathologic pulmonary vascular
remodeling in PAH at a cellular and pathological level with specific changes in gas exchange physiology and
hemodynamics. We hypothesize that different types of remodeling, such as inflammation, fibrosis and
proliferation, result in unique changes in gas exchange physiology and hemodynamics that can be monitored
with 129Xe MRI. Our preliminary studies have identified a 129Xe MRI signatures that differentiates PAH from other
common heart and lung diseases. This technology is also sensitive to early pulmonary vascular remodeling 1-2
weeks after exposure to monocrotaline (MCT) in a preclinical rat PH model. We will extend these studies and
determine our objective via the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the relationship between
pulmonary vascular remodeling and both gas exchange and hemodynamic abnormalities in PAH patients
undergoing lung transplant, to correlate lung pathology and cellular identity with defects in 129Xe MRI gas
exchange and spectroscopy. In Aim 2, we will determine the sensitivity of different monitoring approaches to
early remodeling and response to therapy in the MCT and Sugen-hypoxia preclinical models of PH. In Aim 3, we
will determine the ability of 129Xe MRI to longitudinally monitor disease progression in patients. The expected
outcomes of this project will be a direct link between pulmonary vascular remodeling and changes in lung
physiology, along with a novel, noninvasive biomarker for its monitoring. This proposed research is significant
because it will define the mechanistic links between pulmonary vascular remodeling and changes in gas
exchange physiology and hemodynamics in PAH. These studies will have an important positive impact because
they lay the foundation for a strategy of noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of PAH activity in the clinic.","<3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><Active Follow-up><Address><Appointment><Biological Markers><Blood Diseases><Blood Vessels><Blood Volume><Blood capillaries><Blood gas><Cardiac Catheterization><Cardiac Catheterization Procedures><Cardiac Diseases><Cardiac Disorders><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Growth in Number><Cell Multiplication><Cell Proliferation><Cell Signaling><Cellular Proliferation><Cessation of life><Clinic><Clinical><Common Rat Strains><Death><Defect><Diagnosis><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Drug Therapy><Early Diagnosis><Echocardiogram><Echocardiography><Exposure to><Fibrosis><Foundations><Future><Gases><Health><Heart Catheterization><Heart Catheterization Procedure><Heart Diseases><Heart failure><Hematologic Diseases><Hematological Disease><Hematological Disorder><Histology><Histopathology><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Human><Hypoxia><Hypoxic><Inflammation><Insertion of catheter into heart chamber><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Knowledge><Life><Link><Lung><Lung Diseases><Lung Grafting><Lung Respiratory System><Lung Transplantation><MR Imaging><MR Tomography><MRI><MRI Scans><MRIs><Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan><Maps><Measures><Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance><Methods><Mission><Modeling><Modern Man><Monitor><Monocrotaline><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><NIH><NMR Imaging><NMR Tomography><National Institutes of Health><Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Outcome><Oxygen Deficiency><Pathologic><Pathology><Patient Monitoring><Patients><Pattern><Pharmacotherapy><Phenotype><Physiology><Pre-Clinical Model><Preclinical Models><Process><Proliferating><Public Health><Pulmonary Diseases><Pulmonary Disorder><Pulmonary Graft><Pulmonary Hypertension><Pulmonary Pathology><Pulmonary Transplant><Pulmonary Transplantation><Pulmonary imaging><Rat><Rats Mammals><Rattus><Research><Severities><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Specificity><Spectroscopy><Spectrum Analyses><Spectrum Analysis><Technology><Testing><Time><Transplantation><Transthoracic Echocardiography><United States National Institutes of Health><Walking><Xe element><Xenon><Zeugmatography><active followup><arteriole><bio-markers><biologic marker><biological signal transduction><biomarker><blood disorder><blood pressure elevation><capillary><cardiac failure><cardiac function><clinical care><disease diagnosis><disease of the lung><disorder of the lung><drug treatment><early detection><elevated blood pressure><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><function of the heart><heart disorder><heart function><heart sonography><hemodynamics><impaired pulmonary vascularization><improved><increase in blood pressure><increased blood pressure><lung disorder><lung imaging><lung pathology><lung scanning><lung transplant><lung vascular disease><lung vascular remodeling><mortality><new approaches><new technology><non-invasive diagnosis><non-invasive diagnostic><non-invasive monitor><noninvasive diagnosis><noninvasive diagnostic><noninvasive monitor><novel><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><novel technologies><pre-clinical><preclinical><prognostic><public health relevance><pulmonary><pulmonary arterial hypertension><pulmonary artery hypertension><pulmonary vascular disease><pulmonary vascular disorder><pulmonary vascular dysfunction><pulmonary vascular remodeling><pulmonary vasculopathy><response><response to therapy><response to treatment><right heart failure><right sided heart failure><right ventricle failure><right ventricular failure><right ventricular heart failure><scRNA-seq><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single-cell RNA sequencing><standard of care><therapeutic response><therapy response><three dimensional><transplant><treatment response><treatment responsiveness><vascular>",Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Heart Disease; Lung; Pulmonary Hypertension; Rare Diseases
Phase IA/IB Study of AAVrh.10hFXN Therapy to Treat the Cardiomyopathy of Friedreich's Ataxia,Phase IA/IB Study of AAVrh.10hFXN Therapy to Treat the Cardiomyopathy of Friedreich's Ataxia,"Abstract. The goal of this R61/R33 proposal is to carry out a phase IA/IB clinical study of
AAVrh.10hFXN (a serotype rh.10 adeno-associated virus coding for human frataxin) to treat
cardiac manifestations of Friedreich’s ataxia (FA), the most common inherited ataxia. FA is a fatal,
presently, untreatable disorder. Most cases result from intron variants in the frataxin (FXN) gene; when
inherited from both parents, there is resulting haploinsufficiency of FXN gene expression. While
progressive neurologic disease limits mobility, cardiomyopathy is responsible for substantial morbidity and
60% of deaths secondary to progressive heart failure and arrhythmias. Cardiac MRI (CMR) data from our
group and others demonstrate that FA-associated cardiomyopathy initially manifests with increased left
ventricular (LV) myocardial mass (a potentially reversible phenotype) prior to development of myocardial
fibrosis (irreversible damage). AAVrh.10hFXN, the therapeutic gene transfer vector to be used in the
proposed human study, is a nonhuman primate-derived serotype rh.10 capsid with a constitutive promoter
driving the normal human frataxin cDNA. AAVrh.10hFXN will be administered intravenously, a vector and
route which in experimental animal models effectively delivers genes to the heart. Based on our preclinical
efficacy data in two murine models in which intravenous AAVrh.10hFXN reverses the consequences of FA
cardiomyopathy, together with extensive safety data, we are ready to initiate a phase IA/IB clinical trial
with the following aims. R61 aim 1. Prepare and submit an Investigational New Drug package and gain
approval from the FDA and other regulatory groups (Institutional Review Board, Biosafety) to initiate a
phase IA/IB clinical trial. Milestone. Full regulatory approval to initiate parts A and B of the clinical trial,
enroll the 1st subject in part A. R61 aim 2 and milestone. Manufacture clinical grade AAVrh.10hFXN for
the part A (safety/dose-ranging) clinical trial. R33 aim 3. Carry out the part A (safety/dose-ranging) trial to
determine the maximum tolerable dose of AAVrh.10hFXN therapy for the cardiac manifestations of FA.
Milestone. Initiate and complete assessment of n=9 individuals (3 doses, 3 each), with an audited final
report. R33 aim 4 and milestone. Manufacture clinical grade AAVrh.10hFXN for part B (safety/preliminary
efficacy) clinical trial. R33 aim 5. Carry out the part B safety/preliminary efficacy study at the highest
tolerable dose from part A. Milestone. Complete assessment of n=15 individuals, with an audited final
report. Given that genetic variance is responsible for many forms of cardiomyopathy and that existing
treatments are limited, this study offers a potential therapeutic paradigm shift to reverse cardiac phenotype
and thus improve clinical outcomes for a broad range of patients with genetically mediated
cardiomyopathies at risk adverse LV remodeling and its devastating clinical consequences.",<Adeno-Associated Viruses><Adverse Experience><Adverse event><Affect><Arrhythmia><Ataxia><Ataxy><Automobile Driving><Biological Markers><Blood Serum><Capsid><Cardiac><Cardiac Arrhythmia><Cardiomyopathies><Cessation of life><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Clinical Trials><Code><Coding System><Complementary DNA><Coordination Impairment><DNA cassette><Data><Death><Dependoparvovirus><Dependovirus><Development><Disease><Disorder><Dose><Drug Packaging><Dyssynergia><ECG><EKG><Early identification><Echocardiogram><Echocardiography><Electrocardiogram><Electrocardiography><Enrollment><Experimental Animal Model><Fibrosis><Fibrosis in the heart><Fibrosis in the myocardium><Fibrosis within the heart><Fibrosis within the myocardium><Fibrotic myocardium><Freidreich's Ataxia><Friedreich Ataxia><Friedreich Disease><Friedreich Spinocerebellar Ataxia><Friedreich's Familial Ataxia><Friedreich's Hereditary Ataxia><Friedreich's Hereditary Spinal Ataxia><Friedreich's tabes><Gene Expression><Genes><Genetic><Genome><Goals><Heart><Heart Arrhythmias><Heart Muscle tissue><Heart failure><Hereditary><Hereditary Disease><Hereditary Spinal Sclerosis><Human><Hypertrophy><IRB><IRBs><Inborn Genetic Diseases><Individual><Inherited><Inherited disorder><Institutional Review Boards><Intervening Sequences><Intravenous><Introns><Investigational Drugs><Investigational New Drugs><LV remodeling><Left><Left Ventricular Dysfunction><Left Ventricular Hypertrophy><Left Ventricular Remodeling><Life><Link><Mediating><Mitochondria><Modern Man><Monitor><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Myocardial><Myocardial Diseases><Myocardial Disorder><Myocardial tissue><Myocardiopathies><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neurologic Disorders><Neurological Disorders><Out-patients><Outcome><Outpatients><Parents><Patients><Phase><Phase 1a/1b Clinical trial><Phase Ia/Ib Clinical Trial><Phenotype><Procedures><Production><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Quality Control><Records><Reporting><Risk><Route><Safety><Secondary to><Serotyping><Serum><Statistical Data Analyses><Statistical Data Analysis><Statistical Data Interpretation><Therapeutic><Time><Toxicology><Transthoracic Echocardiography><Variant><Variation><Ventricular><adeno associated virus group><bio-markers><biologic marker><biomarker><cDNA><cardiac MRI><cardiac failure><cardiac fibrosis><cardiac magnetic resonance imaging><coronary fibrosis><developmental><driving><efficacy study><enhancer cassette><enroll><expression cassette><familial cardiomyopathy><family ataxia><fibrotic heart><frataxin><gene cassette><gene therapeutics><gene transfer vector><gene-based therapeutic><gene-based therapeutics><genes therapeutic><genes therapeutics><genetic cardiomyopathy><genetic cassette><heart fibrosis><heart sonography><hereditary cardiomyopathy><hereditary disorder><heritable disorder><human study><improved><inborn error><inherited cardiomyopathy><inherited diseases><inherited genetic disease><inherited genetic disorder><integration cassette><intravenous administration><left ventricle abnormality><left ventricle remodeling><manufacture><manufacturing process><mitochondrial><mouse model><murine model><myocardial fibrosis><myocardium disease><myocardium disorder><neurological disease><non-human primate><nonhuman primate><open label><open label study><parent><pre-clinical efficacy><preclinical efficacy><preservation><promoter><promoter cassette><promotor><reporter cassette><resistance cassette><safety assessment><selectable cassette><selection cassette><statistical analysis><stop cassette><therapeutic gene><transcription cassette><transcriptional cassette><transgene cassette><vector>,Biomedical Imaging; Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Gene Therapy; Gene Therapy Clinical Trials; Genetics; Heart Disease; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Rare Diseases
The Development of a Biatrial Catheter for a Cardiopulmonary Support System in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,The Development of a Biatrial Catheter for a Cardiopulmonary Support System in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,"ABSTRACT
Pulmonary arterial hypertension continues to be a devastating chronic disease. Despite a variety of new
therapies, this disease process remains highly morbid and fatal. Most therapies are only temporizing and are
minimally effective because of the insidious onset and late recognition of this disease process. Double lung
transplantation is the only effective treatment; however, because of scarcity of organs and listing inequities, most
patients are unlikely to receive a transplant while on the waiting list. Developing an effective long-term support
system that can offload the right ventricle and protect the pulmonary vasculature would provide a bridge of
support and potential for recovery or management on pharmacological support. The objective and long-term
goal of this project is to design a catheter that will eventually be coupled with a pulmonary support system that
can prolong the survival and enhance the ability to medically treat patients with pulmonary artery hypertension,
as well as provide a chance for those on the lung transplant waiting list to receive an organ. We intend to
accomplish this by developing an innovative dual lumen catheter that can be positioned and fixed for a prolonged

"Inhaled Nitric Oxide for Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia - The ""NONO trial"" - a pragmatic, multi-center, de-implementation, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized trial","Inhaled Nitric Oxide for Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia - The ""NONO trial"" - a pragmatic, multi-center, de-implementation, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized trial","Project summary / abstract
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a complex congenital anomaly where an early embryologic insult
disrupts diaphragmatic and pulmonary development, often resulting in severe, acute cardiopulmonary
dysfunction post-natally and affects 2-4 per 10,000 births in the US, amounting to approximately 1500 children
every year with an annual societal cost approaching $400 million. The CDH Study Group (CDHSG), established
in 1995, is a consortium of institutions dedicated to improving the lives of families/patients affected by CDH
through collaboration, data collation, investigation, and dissemination. Previous trials in CDH suffered limitations
common to many uncommon disease investigative efforts including limited enrollment, prolonged trial conduct,
inflated resource utilization, and suboptimal power, all for unconvincing evidence. The overarching goal of this
multi-institutional initiative is to leverage the strength of collaboration, experienced clinical investigator
leadership, and innovative trial design/analysis to address clinical questions in CDH. An important example is
the use of inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) in the postnatal stabilization phase of clinical care in CDH. Despite mounting
evidence concluding that, among patients with CDH, iNO is ineffective (and potentially harmful) and costly, most
clinicians maintain equipoise over its effectiveness, and use remains near universal. Our investigative approach,
a pragmatic, multi-center, de-implementation trial, with a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized design, within the
construct of an established registry, will address the clinical and cost-effectiveness of iNO in CDH. Nineteen
participating centers will de-implement iNO - randomized at the center level. We will include 900 total neonates
with CDH. Our first specific aim is to determine if de-implementation of iNO in the post-natal resuscitation /
stabilization phase affects the composite outcome of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) use and/or mortality
(composite primary outcome), as well as ECLS use, mortality, and/or oxygenation in CDH (secondary outcomes).
Our second specific aim is to establish the cost-effectiveness of de-implementing iNO as a therapy in the post-
natal resuscitation / stabilization phase of CDH management, which will be assessed as the incremental health
system costs (savings) per prevented ECLS use and/or death. Our third specific aim is to evaluate factors that
influence iNO de-implementation at the individual physician and site level to inform strategies to improve de-
implementation throughout the trial. We believe this initiative, including an innovative design and collaborative
approach, will serve as a foundation for ongoing trials in CDH and will serve as pivotal example for advancing
the adoption of cost-effective, evidence-based strategies in neonatal and pediatric care.",<0-11 years old><0-4 weeks old><Acute><Address><Adopted><Adoption><Affect><Birth><Blood><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Cardiopulmonary><Cardiopulmonary Bypass><Caring><Cessation of life><Charge><Child><Child Youth><Child health care><Children (0-21)><Clinical><Clinical Investigator><Clinical Management><Clinical Trials><Clinical effectiveness><Cluster randomization trial><Cluster randomized trial><Collaborations><Complex><Congenital diaphragmatic hernia><Consensus><Cost Effectiveness Analysis><Critical Illness><Critically Ill><Data><Data Bases><Databases><De-implementation><Death><Dedications><Deimplementation><Development><Diaphragm><Disease><Disorder><Disparities><Disparity><Drugs><Dysfunction><Effectiveness><Enrollment><Equipoise><Failure><Family><Foundations><Functional disorder><Goals><Health system><Heart-Lung Bypass><Impairment><Individual><Infant><Institution><International><Investigation><Investigators><Leadership><Learning><Life><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Medication><Modality><Multi-center trial><Multicenter Trials><Newborn Infant><Newborns><O element><O2 element><Outcome><Oxygen><Parturition><Patient Selection><Patients><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phase><Physicians><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiopathology><Probability><Publishing><Pulmonary Hypertension><Randomized><Recommendation><Registries><Research><Research Design><Research Personnel><Research Resources><Researchers><Resources><Respiratory Diaphragm><Resuscitation><Savings><Series><Site><Study Type><Testing><United States><Variant><Variation><Vasodilating Agent><Vasodilator Agents><Vasodilator Drugs><Vasodilators><child healthcare><clinical care><cluster randomized design><collaborative approach><congenital anomaly><cost><cost effective><cost effective therapy><cost effective treatment><cost effectiveness><cost efficient analysis><cost-effective analysis><data base><data registry><design><designing><developmental><disease heterogeneity><drug/agent><early clinical trial><early phase clinical trial><enroll><evidence base><experience><heart bypass><iNO><implementation outcomes><implementation trial><improved><improved outcome><inhaled nitric oxide><innovate><innovation><innovative><kids><lung failure><mortality><neonatal care><neonatal outcome><neonate><new approaches><newborn child><newborn children><novel><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><participant enrollment><pathophysiology><patient enrollment><pediatric care><pediatric health care><pediatric healthcare><postnatal><prevent><preventing><primary outcome><pulmonary><pulmonary failure><randomisation><randomization><randomly assigned><secondary outcome><societal costs><standardized care><study design><treatment strategy><trial design><youngster>,Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Congenital Structural Anomalies; Cost Effectiveness Research; Digestive Diseases; Dissemination and Implementation Research; Infant Mortality; Lung; Neonatal Respiratory Distress; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Rare Diseases
Uncertainty and Expectation Formation in Acute Respiratory Failure Survivors,Uncertainty and Expectation Formation in Acute Respiratory Failure Survivors,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In-hospital mortality rates for acute respiratory failure (ARF) have improved, resulting in increasing numbers of
ARF survivors. While their survival is indicative of major clinical advances in care, many of these individuals are
left with long-term physical, cognitive, and psychological sequelae of their critical illness, leading to reduced
quality of life (QoL). Interventions in the post-intensive care unit (ICU) setting have struggled to make headway
on improving QoL and there is an urgent need to understand relevant modifiable factors. Evidence suggests that
health expectations and bothersome levels of uncertainty about future health are two such factors. The unifying
goal of this proposal is to understand key factors associated with bothersome uncertainty and expectation
formation in ARF survivors at hospital discharge, as these factors are potential targets for intervention.
We will study a cohort of 65 ARF survivors to characterize the prevalence of bothersome uncertainty and test
the hypothesis that it is associated with perceived quality of healthcare provider communication (Aim 1). We will
also perform at least 25 semi-structured interviews with a purposively selected cohort to further elucidate the
experiences which shaped ARF survivors’ level of uncertainty and identify the sources of information that most
influenced their expectations (Aim 2). This work will be performed leveraging resources allocated to an existing
parent study (1R01HL163660), to ensure feasibility and success within the time period described in this proposal.
This work will fill a gap in knowledge about how bothersome uncertainty and health expectations develop at the
time of hospital discharge after ARF. The results will be applicable to the development of post-ICU interventions
addressing expectations and uncertainty. This study will provide the applicant with essential preliminary data for
a future K-level grant and necessary training in clinical and qualitative research skills including conduct of a
cohort study, collection of patient-reported outcomes, statistical analysis of quantitative data, and conduct and
analysis of qualitative semi-structured interviews. This work will be foundational for the applicant’s long-term goal
of becoming an independently funded clinician investigator working to improve the care of patients in the ICU.","<21+ years old><Acute respiratory failure><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Adverse effects><COVID crisis><COVID epidemic><COVID pandemic><COVID-19 crisis><COVID-19 epidemic><COVID-19 era><COVID-19 global health crisis><COVID-19 global pandemic><COVID-19 health crisis><COVID-19 pandemic><COVID-19 period><COVID-19 public health crisis><COVID-19 years><Cancer Patient><Cancers><Caring><Characteristics><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Cognitive><Cohort Studies><Collection><Concurrent Studies><Critical Illness><Critically Ill><Data><Death Rate><Decision Making><Development><Disabling><Ensure><Funding><Future><Goals><Grant><Health><Health Care Providers><Health Personnel><Healthcare><Healthcare Providers><Healthcare worker><Hospital Mortality><Hospitals><Illness impact><In-house Mortalities><Individual><Influentials><Inhospital Mortality><Injury><Inpatients><Intensive Care Units><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Interview><Investigators><Knowledge><Learning><Left><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Measures><Mediator><Mentors><NHLBI><National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute><Palliative Care><Palliative Therapy><Palliative Treatment><Parents><Participant><Patient Care><Patient Care Delivery><Patient Outcomes Assessments><Patient Reported Measures><Patient Reported Outcomes><Patients><Perception><Population><Population Sizes><Predisposing Factor><Prevalence><Process><QOL><Qualitative Methods><Qualitative Research><Quality of life><Recovery><Reporting><Research><Research Infrastructure><Research Personnel><Researchers><Resource Allocation><SARS-CoV-2 epidemic><SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis><SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic><SARS-CoV-2 pandemic><SARS-coronavirus-2 epidemic><SARS-coronavirus-2 pandemic><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 epidemic><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 pandemic><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic><Shapes><Source><Statistical Data Analyses><Statistical Data Analysis><Statistical Data Interpretation><Structure><Survivors><Testing><Time><Training><Uncertainty><United States><Work><adulthood><care for patients><care of patients><caring for patients><clinician communication><cohort><comfort care><communicate to clinicians><communicate to providers><communicate with clinicians><communicate with doctors><communicate with providers><coping><coronavirus disease 2019 crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic><coronavirus disease 2019 global health crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic><coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic><coronavirus disease 2019 public health crisis><coronavirus disease crisis><coronavirus disease epidemic><coronavirus disease pandemic><coronavirus disease-19 global pandemic><coronavirus disease-19 pandemic><design><designing><developmental><doctor communication><doubt><expectation><experience><health assessment><health care><health care personnel><health care quality><health care worker><health provider><health workforce><healthcare personnel><healthcare quality><improved><injuries><interventional strategy><long-term sequelae><malignancy><medical personnel><mortality rate><mortality ratio><neoplasm/cancer><novel><observational cohort study><parent><physical impairment><provider communication><psychologic><psychological><qualitative reasoning><severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global health crisis><severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic><skills><statistical analysis><success><treatment provider>",Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Health Services; Lung; Rare Diseases
Novel Stabilization Catheter for His Pacing Lead Implant,Novel Stabilization Catheter for His Pacing Lead Implant,"ABSTRACT
Heart failure (HF) is a nationwide epidemic with over 6 million afflicted patients and 600,000 new patients
diagnosed each year. Many HF patients present with left bundle branch (LBB) block morphology and mechanical
dyssynchrony which are strong predictors of cardiovascular mortality. Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)
has emerged as a powerful treatment for HF. Approximately 30% of patients still do not improve after therapy,
however, and improvement of the responder rate to pacing therefore remains a crucial clinical challenge. His
and Left Bundle Branch (LBB) pacing have therefore recently emerged as alternatives CRT. Left bundle pacing
and LBB pacing arguably produce a physiologically normal ventricular activation pattern, by utilizing the native
His-Purkinje system. Despite the creation of specialized pacing electrodes and sheaths, successful placement
of the His lead is achieved in ~80% of cases. Initially, time consuming mapping (and significant fluoroscopic
imaging and related radiation) must be performed to accomplish the following: 1) Locate the His signal, 2) Deliver
the lead perpendicular to the myocardial tissue to reach the His, and 3) Pace to demonstrate selective His
capture with acceptable pacing capture thresholds. Hence, the overall goal of this Phase I proposal is to use a
deployable suction flute-tipped lead placement sheath to both improve mapping the His location of the heart,
and to place the lead into the His with the lead’s orthogonal orientation. Recently, we have developed a sheath
which can deploy a suction flute within the heart. We intend to refine our design and optimize it for His targeting
and stabilization. Suction will also serve as an indicator that our flute is oriented orthogonally to the endocardium.
To build on the previous successes, this work will be accomplished by the following Specific Aims: 1) Refine
flute design to incorporate electrodes, arrayed in the rim of the flute and 2) Validate the safety and
efficacy of the His lead stabilization technology in a cohort of swine (n=6) in a chronic 4-week study. The
validated novel sheath configuration will align our deployable suction flute with a high degree of freedom for
adjustment. The successful completion of this Phase I proposal will systematically address the current
challenges of His lead placement, reducing the complexity of lead placement, while also improving placement
accuracy and long-term outcomes. A subsequent Phase II SBIR will translate this technology to the clinic for
optimization of His pacing, and a reduction in non-responder rates. This technology addresses some of the
shortcomings of CRT that requires three lead placements including one in the coronary sinus which is often
difficult and may require substantial fluoroscopy time. In addition to improved outcome, there is an opportunity
to reduce the healthcare cost of the treatment of HF epidemic.",<ACE Inhibitors><Address><Anatomic Sites><Anatomic structures><Anatomy><Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors><Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Antagonists><Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors><Apex of the Heart><Body Tissues><Bundle Branch disorder><Bundle-Branch Block><Cardiac><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Catheters><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Chronic><Clinic><Clinical><Compensation><Consumption><Coronary><Coronary sinus structure><Devices><Diagnosis><Distal><Diuretics><Drugs><Electrodes><Endocardium><Ensure><Epidemic><Family suidae><Fixation><Fluoroscopy><Freedom><Goals><Health Care Costs><Health Costs><Healthcare><Healthcare Costs><Heart><Heart Muscle tissue><Heart Vascular><Heart failure><Image><Implant><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Kininase II Antagonists><Kininase II Inhibitors><LVAD><Lead><Left><Length><Liberty><Location><Maps><Mechanical Aspiration><Mechanics><Medication><Monitor><Morphology><Myocardial tissue><Outcome><Pace Stimulators><Pacemakers><Patients><Pattern><Pb element><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phase><Physiologic><Physiological><Pigs><Position><Positioning Attribute><Purkinje Fibers><Radiation><Reproducibility><Right Atrium><Right atrial structure><Rotation><SBIR><Safety><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Structure of purkinje fibers><Suction><Suction Drainage><Suidae><Surface><Swine><System><Technology><Time><Tissues><Translating><Treatment Cost><Variant><Variation><Ventricular><Work><biological signal transduction><cardiac failure><cardiac function><cardiac resynchronization therapy><circulatory system><cohort><coronary sinus><design><designing><drug/agent><function of the heart><health care><heart Purkinje's fiber><heart function><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><hemodynamics><imaging><improved><improved outcome><left ventricular assist device><mechanic><mechanical><mortality><new technology><novel><novel technologies><pig model><piglet model><porcine><porcine model><preservation><response><sample fixation><success><suid><swine model><tool>,Bioengineering; Cardiovascular; Heart Disease
Optimization of echocardiography training and guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure within a digital-first self-care program in Uganda,Optimization of echocardiography training and guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure within a digital-first self-care program in Uganda,"Project Summary
In Uganda, heart failure presents significant challenges due to limited resources and high prevalence. This
diversity supplement proposes an implementation adaptation study that aims to enhance HF diagnosis and
treatment through two main strategies. First, leveraging the parent R01's Community of Practice at each site,
investigators will co-design and evaluate an Echocardiography Training Intervention Package for non-
specialists across six Regional Referral Hospitals (Aim 1). This initiative builds upon existing local echo training
models and integrates advanced AI to improve early identification and management of heart failure, especially
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, for which timely initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy
(GDMT) can significantly improve outcomes. Second, the project will analyze trends in GDMT prescribing
within a longitudinal cohort of symptomatic heart failure patients, using mixed effects logistic regression to
understand prescribing practices at the RRHs (Aim 2). By integrating advanced echocardiography training with
comprehensive analysis of GDMT prescribing, the project aims to improve clinical outcomes and establish
sustainable healthcare practices that address broad sociodemographic disparities in HF care across Uganda,
aligning with National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute priorities and enhancing cardiovascular management in
a setting with profound healthcare delivery challenges. In this diversity supplement, the candidate, an assistant
professor medicine in the division of cardiovascular medicine, will apply her expertise in echocardiography and
global health. She will utilize her experience in echocardiography training of non-specialists, gained through
previous work in Haiti, to lead this implementation adaptation study aimed at enhancing heart failure diagnosis
and management. The supplement will provide the funding needed to support the candidate, giving her
mentorship and training in implementation science, while advancing the goals of the parent grant.","<Address><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Caring><Clinical><Community of Practice><Diagnosis><Early Diagnosis><Early identification><Echocardiogram><Echocardiography><Education for Intervention><Educational Intervention><Face><Funding><Goals><Guidelines><Haiti><Healthcare><Healthcare Delivery><Heart Vascular><Heart failure><High Prevalence><Hospital Referrals><Instruction Intervention><Investigators><Lead><Logistic Regressions><Long-term cohort><Longitudinal cohort><Longterm cohort><Medical><Medicine><Mentorship><Modeling><NHLBI><National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute><Outcome><Parents><Patient outcome><Patient-Centered Outcomes><Patient-Focused Outcomes><Patients><Pb element><Research Personnel><Research Resources><Researchers><Resources><Self Care><Site><Specialist><Training><Training Intervention><Transthoracic Echocardiography><Uganda><Work><cardiac failure><circulatory system><design><designing><digital><early detection><experience><faces><facial><global health><health and care delivery><health care><health care delivery><health delivery systems><health services delivery><heart failure and reduced ejection fraction><heart failure with reduced ejection fraction><heart sonography><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><implementation science><improved><improved outcome><instructional intervention><parent><parent grant><patient oriented outcomes><personal care><professor><programs><socio-demographic disparity><socio-demographic inequality><socio-demographic inequity><sociodemographic disparity><sociodemographic inequality><sociodemographic inequity><trend>",Biomedical Imaging; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Heart Disease; Prevention; Social Determinants of Health
Advancing the Lives & HeaLth of Youth and Young Adults with Down Syndrome (ALLY-DS),Advancing the Lives & HeaLth of Youth and Young Adults with Down Syndrome (ALLY-DS),"PROJECT SUMMARY
Endocrinopathies, sleep disorders, cognitive issues, cardiovascular conditions, sensory impairments, and ability
differences not only impact the quality of life of individuals with Down syndrome (DS) and their caregivers but
can intersect to magnify the threats of these co-occurring conditions. Moreover, individuals with intellectual
disabilities face additional barriers surrounding healthcare access and their decision-making involvement that
can jeopardize their health. The dearth of observational studies that richly detail co-occurring conditions, social
determinants of health (SDoH), and the ableism individuals with DS experience represents a major challenge to
providing clinical care to individuals with DS. Our long-term objective is to partner with clinicians, researchers,
individuals with DS, and caregivers across the country to establish a diverse cohort of individuals with DS for
comprehensive longitudinal phenotyping including multi-omics and to develop an infrastructure for intervention
studies. This multi-center, multi-disciplinary collaborative team will engage individuals from infancy through
young adulthood to undergo blood sample collection, imaging studies, qualitative interviews, questionnaire
completion, sleep assessments, and remote physiologic monitoring while subsets will undergo additional specific
procedures with the goal of rich longitudinal phenotyping across multiple systems:
 Endocrine: thyroid and gonadal function
 Cardiometabolic: lipids, inflammation, meal-related glucose excursion, insulin secretion & sensitivity
 Cardiovascular: blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and left ventricular mass and function
 Nutrition: anthropometrics, body composition, bone density, nutritional intake, and appetite/satiety
 Sleep: obstructive and central sleep apnea, hypoventilation, participant and caregiver sleep quantity and quality
 Physical Activity: sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous activity
 Neurocognitive: caregiver reported and objectively assessed measures, peripheral blood Alzheimer disease
 markers, audiology, brain MRI, secondary analyses of sleep study EEG
 SDoH: family education, income, English proficiency, medical literacy, neighborhood characteristics
 Ethical Issues: decision-making involvement, experiences with ableism, and healthcare access
 Electronic Health Information: diagnoses, medications, procedures, labs, and imaging
 Multi-omics: genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome
Procedures will be repeated at a cadence that depends upon baseline age (<15y, every 12-18 mo) or (>15-30y,
every 24-30 mo), baseline results, pre-existing co-morbidities, and subsequent interventions. Community
members will help inform study design and the specific procedures to be undertaken will be tailored to the abilities
of individuals with DS and to minimize participant and caregiver burden.","<12-20 years old><21+ years old><AD dementia><Acceleration><Achievement><Achievement

Heart and Lung Outcomes Post-TB (HALO Post-TB),Heart and Lung Outcomes Post-TB (HALO Post-TB),"ABSTRACT: HEART AND LUNG OUTCOMES POST-TUBERCULOSIS (HALO Post-TB)
The global prevalence of post-tuberculosis lung disease (PTLD) is estimated to be ~50%, but our understanding
of PTLD is incomplete as studies have not performed full pulmonary function testing (PFTs). Furthermore, the
prevalence of cardiovascular sequelae of TB is largely unknown as few post-TB studies have included
assessments of cardiac structure and function. HIV is a risk factor for TB. We and others have shown that HIV
is associated with cardiopulmonary markers associated with worse mortality including decreased diffusion
capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco) on PFTs, elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) on
echocardiography, and reduced cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) on cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).
These US-based studies have included few, if any, individuals with prior TB. To our knowledge, no prior study
has examined pulmonary and cardiac outcomes after TB and the role of HIV as an effect modifier for the
cardiopulmonary phenotypes seen. This Heart and Lung Outcomes Post-TB (HALO Post-TB) study will fill these
gaps. Our central hypothesis is that TB is associated with a higher prevalence of cardiopulmonary disease and
that HIV coinfection modifies cardiopulmonary phenotypes post TB. The overall objectives of this proposal are
to elucidate prevalence, trajectory, and mechanisms of cardiopulmonary abnormalities post-TB in a high TB and
HIV burden country. HALO Post-TB will be a longitudinal cohort study that will enroll people with and without HIV
in Kampala, Uganda including 480 individuals at completion of treatment for pulmonary TB and 120 healthy
comparators who have never had pulmonary TB disease. Specific Aim 1 will perform full PFTs (spirometry, DLco,
and lung volumes), echocardiography, 6-minute walk test, and validated questionnaires to determine the impact
of HIV coinfection on cardiopulmonary function at baseline (completion of TB treatment) and the persistence of
these findings at 2 years. Aim 2 will perform CPET at baseline (completion of TB treatment) in a random subset
of 50% of participants to determine the impact of HIV coinfection on mechanisms underlying cardiorespiratory
fitness. Finally, Aim 3 will examine a panel of 11 plasma biomarkers and use an unbiased machine learning
approach to identify phenotypic clusters and determine whether there are differences in biomarkers that may
identify mechanistic pathways that explain the different phenotypes. The proposed research will include
specimen banking and will serve as the foundational study of the effect of HIV on cardiopulmonary involvement
in post-TB disease, a necessary precursor to identifying mechanisms and potential treatment. The expected
outcome to develop a well-characterized post-TB cohort that includes comprehensive cardiopulmonary
measures to identify distinct cardiopulmonary phenotypes and whether HIV is an effect-modifier on these
phenotypes to enable future mechanistic studies, targeted interventions, and improvements in clinical care.","<AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Active Follow-up><Acute><Age><Biological Markers><Biological Specimen Banks><Biological Substance Banks><Blood Plasma><Blood Vessels><Carbon Monoxide><Cardiac><Cardiopulmonary><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Categories><Chronic><Chronic lung disease><Classification><Clinical><Collaborations><Cor pulmonale><Country><Diffusion><Disease><Disorder><Echocardiogram><Echocardiography><Enrollment><Event><Exercise><Exercise Test><Fibrosis><Funding><Future><Goals><HIV><HIV/Mtb><HIV/TB><HIV/mycobacterium tuberculosis><HIV/tuberculosis><Heart><Heart Vascular><Heart failure><High Prevalence><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Immune reaction><Individual><Infrastructure><International><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><LAV-HTLV-III><Long-term cohort study><Longitudinal cohort study><Longterm cohort study><Low Prevalence><Lung><Lung Diseases><Lung Function Tests><Lung Respiratory System><Lung TB><Lung Tuberculosis><Lung symptom><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><M tuberculosis infection><M. tb infection><M. tuberculosis infection><M. tuberculosis/HIV><M.tb infection><M.tuberculosis infection><MTB infection><Machine Learning><Measures><Methods><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection><Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Outcome><Outcome Study><Participant><Pathway interactions><Pattern><Persons><Phenotype><Plasma><Plasma Serum><Pleural><Prevalence><Productivity><Pulmonary Diseases><Pulmonary Disorder><Pulmonary Heart Disease><Pulmonary Heart Disorder><Pulmonary Hypertension><Pulmonary TB><Pulmonary Tuberculosis><Pulmonary function tests><Questionnaires><Reporting><Research><Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma><Right Ventricles><Right ventricular structure><Risk Factors><Role><Sampling><Spirometry><Stress><Structure><Survivors><Systematics><TB infection><TB therapy><TB treatment><Testing><Therapeutic><Transthoracic Echocardiography><Tuberculosis><Uganda><United States National Institutes of Health><Virus-HIV><Walking><active followup><ages><bio-markers><biologic marker><biological specimen repository><biomarker><biosample repository><biospecimen bank><biospecimen repository><candidate identification><cardiac failure><cardiac function><cardiopulmonary disease><cardiopulmonary disorder><cardiorespiratory fitness><cardiorespiratory health><chronic pulmonary disease><chronic symptom><circulatory system><clinical care><clinical predictors><co-infection><cohort><coinfection><diffused><diffuses><diffusing><diffusions><disease of the lung><disorder of the lung><disseminated TB><disseminated tuberculosis><enroll><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><function of the heart><heart function><heart sonography><immunoreaction><improved><indexing><infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis><inflammation marker><inflammatory marker><interventional strategy><lung artery blood pressure><lung disorder><lung function><lung volume><machine based learning><mortality><pathway><persistent symptom><pressure in pulmonary arteries><pulmonary><pulmonary arterial blood pressure><pulmonary arterial pressure><pulmonary artery pressure><pulmonary artery systolic pressure><pulmonary function><pulmonary symptom><sex><social role><specimen bank><specimen repository><treat M. tuberculosis><treat Mtb><treat Mycobacterium tuberculosis><treat tb><treat tuberculosis><tuberculosis infection><tuberculosis therapy><tuberculosis treatment><tuberculous spondyloarthropathy><vascular>",Biodefense and Related Countermeasures; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Emerging Infectious Diseases; HIV/AIDS; Heart Disease; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Physical Activity; Rare Diseases; Tuberculosis
Advancing Commercial Readiness of a No-implant Interatrial Shunt Therapy to Treat Heart Failure,Advancing Commercial Readiness of a No-implant Interatrial Shunt Therapy to Treat Heart Failure,"ABSTRACT
Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a progressive condition that currently affects over 6 million patients in the US.
It accounts for over $35B in annual healthcare expenditure and is responsible for over one million hospitalizations
each year. Approximately half of all patients with CHF have a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) greater than
40% and are categorized as having heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, EF ≥ 50%) or mid-
range ejection fraction (HFmrEF, 40% ≤ EF < 50%). The prognosis for these patients is poor: due to a paucity
of treatment options, patients have 5-year and 10-year mortality rates of 50% and 90%, respectively. Although
existing pharmacological therapies have demonstrated symptomatic improvement and mortality benefit in
patients with reduced ejection fraction heart failure, there are currently limited FDA-approved treatment options
(pharmacological or device-based) for the HFpEF/HFmrEF patient population. The concept of interatrial shunting
has gained attention as a potential therapeutic option for patients with CHF. By creating a connection between
the high-pressure left atrium to the low-pressure right atrium elevated left atrial pressure (LAP) may be effectively
lowered thereby relieving CHF symptoms. Thus far, interatrial shunt implants have demonstrated positive safety
signals and positive reported outcomes, including significant reduction in left atrial filling pressure, improvements
in 6-minute walk test, quality of life, and New York Heart Association classification and most importantly, heart
failure events. Nonetheless intracardiac implants carry proven clinical risks including clot formation, device
fracture and migration, implantation failure, and interference with future cardiac interventional therapies. There
is currently no device available that can provide therapeutic left atrial decompression without the long-term
clinical risks and concerns of leaving behind a foreign body in the heart. Alleviant Medical has developed a novel
transcatheter approach to relieve left atrial pressure by creating an interatrial shunt without the need for a cardiac
implant. Following the success of design verification testing and positive results from a 38-patient first-in-human
clinical study, Alleviant received FDA IDE approval to investigate the safety and efficacy of a no-implant interatrial
shunt for patients with heart failure in a pivotal randomized controlled trial which is currently underway. The goal
of this Commercial Readiness Pilot proposal has two aims: (1) implement high-volume manufacturing capabilities
and establish production readiness of the ALV1 System, and (2) execute reimbursement and marketing initiatives
to establish value to payers and promote disease and therapy awareness. To achieve this goal, Alleviant will
procure and complete injection mold qualifications for scaled production of critical components, implement
design for manufacturing process modifications, de-risk single source supply chain elements, and increase the
sterilization throughput capacity. Alleviant will develop and execute a strategy for achieving reimbursement
through the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Systems for a no-implant interatrial shunt therapy. Successful
execution of this proposal will result in a commercial ready System with an established pathway reimbursement.","<Abscission><Adoption><Adverse Experience><Adverse event><Affect><Age><Ambulatory Care><American><Angiogram><Angiography><Atrial><Attention><Awareness><Blood><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Blood Vessels><Cardiac><Cardiac Atrium><Cardiac Failure Congestive><Cardiology><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Categories><Catheters><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services><Chronic><Classification><Clinical><Clinical Data><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Clinical Trials><Clotting><Coagulation><Coagulation Process><Code><Coding System><Congestive Heart Failure><Contracting Opportunities><Contracts><Controlled Clinical Trials><Data Set><Death Rate><Development><Device Failures><Devices><Disadvantaged><Disease><Disorder><EFRAC><Education and Training><Ejection Fraction><Elements><Embolization Therapy><Embolotherapy><Equipment><Equipment Malfunction><Event><Excision><Extirpation><FDA approved><Filamentous Fungi><Foreign Bodies><Fracture><Funding><Future><Goals><Health Care Financing Administration><Health Expenditures><Health Policy><Heart><Heart Atrium><Heart Decompensation><Heart Vascular><Heart failure><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Human><Implant><Incidence><Injections><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><LVEF><Leadership><Left><Left Atrium><Left Ventricles><Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction><Left atrial structure><Left ventricular structure><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Marketing><Medical><Medical Societies><Medicare/Medicaid><Metals><Modern Man><Modification><Molds><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><NIH><National Institutes of Health><New York><Outcome><Outpatient Care><Pathway interactions><Patients><Phase><Population><Preparedness><Procedures><Process><Production><Public Health><Pump><QOL><Qualifying><Quality of life><Randomized><Randomized, Controlled Trials><Readiness><Removal><Reporting><Right Atrium><Right atrial structure><Risk><SBIR><Safety><Shunt><Shunt Device><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Societies><Source><Stents><Sterilization><Surgical Removal><Symptoms><System><Systematics><Technology><Testing><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Embolization><Therapeutic Intervention><Thrombus><Training and Education><United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services><United States Health Care Financing Administration><United States National Institutes of Health><Validation><Walking><Woman><Work><acute care><ages><alleviate symptom><ameliorating symptom><angiographic imaging><arm><atrium><biological signal transduction><bone fracture><cardiac failure><cardiac implant><chronic heart failure><circulatory system><clinical risk><college><collegiate><commercial launch><commercial product launch><commercial scale manufacturing><commercialization><conference><convention><decrease symptom><design><design validation><design verification><designing><developmental><disparity in care><disparity in healthcare><embolization><failure Implantation><fewer symptoms><first in man><first-in-human><health care disparity><health care expenditure><health care inequality><health care inequity><health care policy><healthcare disparity><healthcare expenditure><healthcare inequality><healthcare inequity><healthcare policy><heart failure and reduced ejection fraction><heart failure with reduced ejection fraction><high level production><high risk><high scale production><high volume manufacturing><high volume production><improve symptom><improved><intervention therapy><interventional strategy><manufacture><manufacturing capabilities><manufacturing capacity><manufacturing process><manufacturing ramp-up><manufacturing scale-up><medical expenditure><meeting><meetings><migration><mortality><mortality rate><mortality ratio><new technology><novel><novel technologies><outpatient treatment><pathway><patient advocacy group><patient population><patient prognosis><payment><pharmacologic><pre-clinical><preclinical><preservation><pressure><programs><pulmonary><randomisation><randomization><randomized control trial><randomly assigned><reduce symptoms><relieves symptoms><resection><scale up batch><scale up production><shunts><success><summit><supply chain><symposia><symposium><symptom alleviation><symptom improvement><symptom reduction><symptom relief><symptomatic improvement><upscale manufacturing><validations><vascular>",Assistive Technology; Bioengineering; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Health Services; Heart Disease
Software Tool for Optimization of CRT,Software Tool for Optimization of CRT,"ABSTRACT
Heart failure (HF) is a nationwide epidemic. Many HF patients are presented with left bundle branch block
(LBBB) morphology and mechanical dyssynchrony, which are strong predictors of cardiovascular mortality. For
patients with prolonged QRS duration >150 ms, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is recommended to
restore normal activation patterns in the heart. About 30% of patients, however, still do not improve after CRT
(non-responders), and the percentage of CRT non-responders has remained relatively constant. To address
the issue of CRT non-responders and improve the treatment of conduction disorders, there are new exciting
developments in pacing therapy (e.g., HIS bundle pacing, left branch bundle (LBB) pacing, LV endocardial
pacing). When ischemia and/or a scar are present, experiments have shown that lead positioning and timing of the
LV stimulation are critical parameters that require precise optimization to achieve positive CRT responses. This is
especially relevant when a large number of CRT recipients (≥50%) in North America and Europe have ischemic
cardiomyopathy (ICM), and the percentage of CRT non-responders is higher in ICM patients than in non-ICM
patients. As such, computational models are powerful tools that can be exploited to optimize CRT response on a
patient-specific basis. In this Phase I grant, we will develop a software tool for the optimization of therapies to
reduce non-responder rates and patient identification for CRT, conduction system pacing (CSP), and LV
endocardial pacing (LVEP) therapies using physics-based modeling, artificial intelligence, and machine
learning (ML). Coronary flow and electromechanics models will be coupled bi-directionally. We pioneered
modeling of this coupling that includes coronary flow regulation mechanisms. These studies suggest a
threshold in coronary perfusion, depending on the ischemia location and size, where CRT is ineffective (i.e.,
“point of no return”). With patient-specific data, we can translate our swine-specific models to the clinic, as we
did for our study on the effects of an LV assist device on a failing human biventricular unit. This work will be
accomplished by the following two Specific Aims: (1) Modify an existing experimentally-validated cardiac
electro-mechanics-perfusion computational framework to simulate the acute effects of CRT, CSP, and
LVEP in treating mechanical dyssynchrony in LBBB + ischemia; and (2) Integrate the computational
modeling framework with ML and optimization algorithms to optimize CRT, CSP, and LVEP in patients
with ischemia. This proposal will provide a software tool for optimizing therapies to reduce non-responder
rates and patient identification for CRT, CSP, and LVEP therapies. This would have a substantial impact on
improving treatment and reducing the healthcare cost of the HF epidemic. A successful Phase I will pave the
way to Phase II to advance this technology through regulatory approval of software as a medical device to
improve CRT outcomes.",<AI based model><AI model><Acute><Address><Affect><Algorithms><Artificial Heart Ventricle><Artificial Ventricles><Bundle Branch disorder><Bundle-Branch Block><Cardiac><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Cicatrix><Clinic><Computer Models><Computer Software Tools><Computerized Models><Coronary><Coupled><Coupling><Data><Decision Trees><Development><Disease><Disorder><Epidemic><Europe><Family suidae><Generations><Geometry><Grant><Health Care Costs><Health Costs><Healthcare Costs><Heart><Heart Vascular><Heart failure><Human><Ischemia><Lead><Left><Left Ventricles><Left ventricular structure><Letters><Location><Machine Learning><Maps><Measurable><Mechanics><Modeling><Modern Man><Morphology><North America><Outcome><Output><Patients><Pattern><Pb element><Perfusion><Phase><Physics><Physiologic><Physiological><Pigs><Position><Positioning Attribute><Recommendation><Regulation><Scars><Software Tools><Suidae><Swine><System><Technology><Testing><Time><Training><Translating><Ventricle-Assist Device><Ventricular><Work><artificial intelligence model><artificial intelligence-based model><cardiac failure><cardiac resynchronization therapy><circulatory system><computational framework><computational modeling><computational models><computer based models><computer framework><computerized modeling><coronary perfusion><developmental><experience><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><hemodynamics><improved><ischemic cardiomyopathy><machine based learning><machine learned algorithm><machine learning algorithm><machine learning based algorithm><mechanic><mechanical><mortality><neural network><new approaches><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><porcine><predictive tools><premature><prematurity><preservation><pressure><response><response to therapy><response to treatment><simulation><software as a medical device><software as medical device><software toolkit><success><suid><therapeutic outcome><therapeutic response><therapy optimization><therapy outcome><therapy response><timeline><tool><treatment optimization><treatment response><treatment responsiveness><ventricular assist device>,Bioengineering; Cardiovascular; Data Science; Heart Disease; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD)
Building Healthy Habits for Heart Health,Building Healthy Habits for Heart Health,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Vascular calcification is the major precursor to cardiovascular disease and is further
exacerbated by chronic kidney disease. Black or African Americans are more than 3
times as likely and Hispanics or Latinos are 1.3 times more likely to have kidney failure
compared to White Americans. In addition to Black Americans having higher rates of
heart and kidney diseases, they also often live in rural or impoverished areas that are
food deserts. Low-income areas are more than often communities with a lack of access
to healthy foods, otherwise known as food deserts. Heart disease and other CVCs such
as chronic kidney disease, Stroke, and etc are the leading cause of death for African-
Americans, more so African-American males. While phosphate is a natural element that
is found in meat and dairy products, it is also a known precursor to vascular calcification
which leads to the onset of CVCs and other complications. The levels of phosphate in
industrially processed foods and meats are found to be much higher than levels in fresh
produce. Increased serum levels of inorganic phosphate leads to calcification of
vascular smooth muscle cells and a phenotypic switch to an osteoblast-like cell. Once
thought to be a passive process of calcium and phosphate deposition within arteries,
vascular calcification is now known to be an active, cell-regulated condition. There is a
clinical need to develop a therapy for vascular calcification that reduces calcification
without causing arterial damage similar to current therapies such as endovascular stent
and atherectomy. This project will examine the role of phosphate in vascular smooth
muscle cell calcification and the potential of protein therapy to reduce calcification. The
proposed protein therapy would include reestablish fetuin-A to its native levels to treat
smooth muscle cell calcification in patients with the comorbidities of heart disease and
chronic kidney disease. Fetuin-A forms in the liver, gets released into the blood stream,
then stabilizes free calcium-phosphate clusters into calciprotein particles that are filtered
from the blood by the kidneys and excreted through urine. Through a collaboration with
MSU Extension we will work to increase the diversity of the biomedical workforce while
allowing the participants to give back to their communities and help older generations.",<Address><Advocate><African American><African American group><African American individual><African American people><African American population><African Americans><Afro American><Afroamerican><Alpha-1-Fetoprotein><Alpha-Fetoglobulin><Apoplexy><Area><Arteries><Atherectomy><Back><Basic Research><Basic Science><Black American><Blood><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Blood Serum><Brain Vascular Accident><Calcified><Calcium><Cardiac Chronotropism><Cardiac Diseases><Cardiac Disorders><Cardiac health><Cardiovascular Diseases><Cause of Death><Cell Body><Cells><Cellular Mechanotransduction><Cerebral Stroke><Cerebrovascular Apoplexy><Cerebrovascular Stroke><Chronic Kidney Failure><Chronic Renal Disease><Chronic Renal Failure><Clinical><Collaborations><Communities><Community Education><Community Health><Community Health Education><Dairy Products><Dedications><Deposit><Deposition><Disease><Disorder><Disparities><Disparity><Dorsum><Elements><Ensure><Environment><Excretory function><Fetuins><First Generation College Students><First Generation College graduates><First Generation Students><Food><Generations><Habits><Health><Health Food><Heart Diseases><Heart Rate><Heart health><Hemodialyses><Hemodialysis><High School Student><Hispanic Populations><Hispanic group><Hispanic individual><Hispanic people><Hispanics><Impoverished Areas><Impoverished Regions><Industrialization><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Investigators><Kidney><Kidney Diseases><Kidney Failure><Kidney Insufficiency><Kidney Urinary System><Knowledge><Latino Population><Latino group><Latino individual><Latino people><Latinos><Leadership><Leiomyocyte><Literature><Lived experience><Lived experiences><Liver><Low income><Maintenance><Meat><Meat Products><Mechanical Signal Transduction><Mechanosensory Transduction><Mentors><Minerals><Mississippi><Modeling><Nephropathy><Osteoblasts><Outcome><Participant><Patients><Percutaneous Atherectomy><Percutaneous Transluminal Atherectomy><Persons><Phenotype><Phosphates><Physiologic><Physiological><Population><Poverty Areas><Poverty Regions><Process><Proteins><Publishing><R-Series Research Projects><R01 Mechanism><R01 Program><Renal Disease><Renal Failure><Renal Insufficiency><Research><Research Grants><Research Personnel><Research Project Grants><Research Projects><Researchers><Role><Rural Community><Scientist><Secondary School Student><Secondary Student><Serum><Signal Pathway><Smooth Muscle Cells><Smooth Muscle Myocytes><Smooth Muscle Tissue Cell><Stents><Stream><Stroke><Students><Time><Training><Training Programs><Transluminal Atherectomy><Underrepresented Groups><Underrepresented Populations><Universities><Urine><Vascular Smooth Muscle><Vascular calcification><Woman><Work><absorption><black male><black men><blood filter><brain attack><calcification><calcium phosphate><cardiovascular disorder><career><catalyst><caucasian American><cerebral vascular accident><cerebrovascular accident><chronic kidney disease><co-morbid><co-morbidity><community-based health><comorbidity><disparity in health><ethnic minority><excretion><experience><food desert><graduate school><health disparity><healthy food><heart disorder><hepatic body system><hepatic organ system><high schoolers><inhibitor><inorganic phosphate><interest><interventional strategy><kidney disorder><male><mechanosensing><mechanotransduction><particle><peer coaching><peer instruction><peer led team learning><peer mentoring><peer teaching><poverty stricken areas><preference><programs><renal><renal disorder><rural area><rural location><rural region><social role><stroked><strokes><under representation of groups><under represented groups><under represented people><under represented populations><undergrad><undergraduate><undergraduate student><underrepresentation of groups><underrepresented people><volunteer><white American><α-Fetoproteins>,Assistive Technology; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Bioengineering; Cardiovascular; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease; Kidney Disease; Nutrition; Racial and Ethnic Minority Health Research; Rural Health; Social Determinants of Health
Missense Variants in Myosin Binding Protein C that Cause Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy,Missense Variants in Myosin Binding Protein C that Cause Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy,"Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) experience a high symptomatic burden, heart failure and
lethal arrhythmias. While HCM has been recognized as a disease of the sarcomere for >30 years, the disease
mechanisms for sarcomeric gene variants are not well defined, limiting the precision and efficacy of treatment
options. Heterozygous variants in the gene myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3) cause half of all cases of
familial HCM. About 15% of these are missense variants that cluster in interior protein domains C3 and C6
which have uncertain binding partners or function. Computational predictions combined with our
published and preliminary experimental data support the hypothesis that missense variants in C3 and
C6 domains lead to perturbation of multiple protein-protein interactions that are critical for the normal
function of MyBP-C (the protein encoded by MYBPC3). In Aim 1 we will apply TurboID proximity labeling to
wild-type (WT) and mutant MyBP-C. In preliminary data we have identified >200 novel and unique neighboring
proteins to WT MyBP-C. Comparing C3 and C6 mutants to wild-type MyBP-C, relative abundances of
sarcomeric, cytoskeletal and ribonucleoprotein complexes are reduced, while abundances of ribosomal and
chaperone proteins are increased. We will explore consequences of these altered interactions by assessing
changes in myosin conformation, local translation, and chaperone-mediate protein turnover. We expect to find
that interactions with multiple proteins of diverse function are either strengthened or weakened by the presence
of missense mutations in MyBP-C. Overcoming this perturbation in protein interactions with gene replacement
by wild-type MyBP-C is the focus of Aim 2 where we will test the hypothesis that the mutant protein can be
stoichiometrically replaced within the sarcomere by wild-type MyBP-C. We will transduce patient-derived
inducible-pluripotent cardiomyocytes expressing C3 or C6 missense variants with adeno-associated viral
vectors expressing wild-type MyBP-C or a lentiviral vector expressing a “titratable” wild-type MyBP-C-FKBP12
fusion protein that enables dose-response studies. The outcome measures will be the molar ratio of mutant to
wild-type protein, and contractile and relaxation velocities. In vivo studies of gene replacement in a new
Arg506Trp MYBPC3 knock-in mouse model will complement the hiPSC-CM experiments. This application
explores several novel aspects of MyBP-C biology and features unique reagents and advanced proteomic
techniques. Successful completion of these aims will uncover new biology in MyBP-C by defining an expanded
protein neighborhood, by revealing disease mechanisms for missense MYBPC3 variants, and by testing a
gene displacement strategy that leverages endogenous regulation of sarcomeric stoichiometry and could be
broadly applicable to missense variants in any sarcomere gene. Our investigative team, composed of a mix of
senior, highly experienced investigators and talented junior investigators with unique skill sets, is well poised to
achieve these goals.",<AAV vector><AAV-based vector><Actin-Activated ATPase><Affect><Alleles><Allelomorphs><Arrhythmia><Assay><Asymmetric Septal Hypertrophy><Binding><Binding Proteins><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Biological Function><Biological Process><Biology><Cardiac Arrhythmia><Cardiac Failure Congestive><Cardiac Muscle Cells><Cardiac Myocytes><Cardiocyte><Cellular Matrix><Chaperone><Chimera Protein><Chimeric Proteins><Clinical Trials><Complement><Complement Proteins><Complex><Congestive Heart Failure><Cytoskeletal System><Cytoskeleton><DNA Alteration><DNA Sequence Alteration><DNA Therapy><DNA mutation><Data><Disease><Disease Pathway><Disorder><Dose><Echocardiogram><Echocardiography><Electrostatics><Eligibility><Eligibility Determination><FK506-Binding Protein 1><FK506-Binding Protein 1A><FKBP-12><FKBP12><Familial Asymmetric Septal Hypertrophy><Familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy><Familial Ventricular Hypertrophy><Fusion Protein><Gene Delivery><Gene Transfer Clinical><Gene variant><Genes><Genetic><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic Intervention><Genetic defect><Genetic mutation><Goals><Heart><Heart Arrhythmias><Heart Decompensation><Heart Muscle Cells><Heart failure><Heart myocyte><Hereditary ventricular hypertrophy><Heterozygote><Human><Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy><Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy><Idiopathic Hypertrophic Subvalvular Stenosis><Idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis><Investigators><KI mice><Knock-in Mouse><Label><Laboratories><Lead><Lentiviral Vector><Lentivirus Vector><Ligand Binding Protein><Ligand Binding Protein Gene><Macrophilin-12><Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis><Mass Spectrometry><Mass Spectroscopy><Mass Spectrum><Mass Spectrum Analyses><Mass Spectrum Analysis><Measures><Mediating><Metabolic Protein Degradation><Missense Mutation><Modern Man><Molecular Chaperones><Molecular Configuration><Molecular Conformation><Molecular Interaction><Molecular Stereochemistry><Mutate><Mutation><MyBP-C protein><Myocardium><Myofibrils><Myosin ATPase><Myosin Adenosine Triphosphatase><Myosin Adenosinetriphosphatase><Myosins><Neighborhoods><Outcome Measure><Pathogenicity><Patients><Pb element><Peptide Domain><Protein Binding><Protein Domains><Protein Turnover><Proteins><Proteomics><Protocol Screening><Publishing><Reagent><Regulation><Regulatory Protein Degradation><Relaxation><Research Personnel><Researchers><Ribonucleoproteins><Ribosomes><Sarcomeres><Sequence Alteration><Surface Properties><Tacrolimus Binding Protein 1A><Talents><Techniques><Tertiary Protein Structure><Testing><Therapeutic><Translations><Transthoracic Echocardiography><Treatment Efficacy><Variant><Variation><Viral Vector><adeno-associated viral vector><adeno-associated virus vector><allele variant><allelic variant><bound protein><cardiac failure><cardiac muscle><cardiomyocyte><chronic heart failure><complementation><conformation><conformational><conformational state><conformationally><conformations><congenital hypertrophic cardiomyopathy><delivery vector><delivery vehicle><experience><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><gene repair therapy><gene replacement><gene replacement therapy><gene therapy><gene-based therapy><genetic therapy><genetic variant><genome mutation><genomic alteration><genomic therapy><genomic variant><heart muscle><heart sonography><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><heterozygosity><hypertrophic myocardiopathy><iPS><iPSC><iPSCs><improved><in vivo><induced pluripotent cell><induced pluripotent stem cell><inducible pluripotent stem cell><inherited hypertrophic cardiomyopathy><insight><intervention efficacy><intracellular skeleton><knockin mice><loss of function><measurable outcome><mouse model><murine model><mutant><myosin-binding protein C><novel><outcome measurement><prevent><preventing><primary outcome><protein degradation><protein protein interaction><response><secondary outcome><skills><stoichiometry><success><sudden cardiac death><therapeutic efficacy><therapy efficacy><translation>,Biotechnology; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Heart Disease; Pediatric; Pediatric Cardiomyopathy; Rare Diseases
The Etiology of Risk: Alcohol Use Disorder and Suicidal Behavior,The Etiology of Risk: Alcohol Use Disorder and Suicidal Behavior,"Project Summary
The current renewal proposal seeks to expand upon our successful initial award to clarify the mechanisms
underlying observed associations between alcohol use disorder (AUD) and suicidal behaviors (SB), including
non-fatal suicide attempts and suicide death. The research team has an extensive history of productive
collaborations, including in the realm of psychiatric and substance use disorder research. We have access to
longitudinal Swedish national registries including medical, criminal, census, family, and socioeconomic data for
nearly 11 million individuals; these resources will be linked to create detailed datasets encompassing a wide
range of risk factors at individual, familial, and environmental levels. We will utilize these resources to extend
our prior research through the pursuit of four specific aims. In the first aim we will evaluate how AUD and post-
traumatic stress disorder, or trauma exposure, relate via mediating or moderating pathways to risk of SB. We
will apply well-established methods, including those that facilitate causal inference. Second, we will directly
compare and contrast pathways to SB via AUD versus major depression (MD). AUD and MD constitute two
primary correlates/risk factors for SB, but much remains unknown about distinctions and commonalities between
these associations. The current proposal will focus primarily on the role of social dysfunction, with the goal of
identifying factors that may improve risk assessment. Third, we will consider how AUD relates to two common
medical conditions, cardiovascular disease and dementia, with respect to SB risk. Both conditions are
themselves associated with increased SB risk but whether they mediate and/or exacerbate the impact of AUD
is not known. Finally, we will leverage our expertise in genetic epidemiology by pursuing analyses that will clarify
how aggregate genetic liability to AUD or SB, versus AUD and SB, is differentially related to psychopathology
and other correlates of risk. Critically, Sweden and the US have comparable rates of suicidal behavior and share
many characteristics, including an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population; however, the US lacks
registry resources comparable to those available in Sweden. We expect that the statistical power of these
registries, in conjunction with the research team’s extensive expertise in psychiatric and substance abuse

MR-compatible Devices for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cardiomyopathies,MR-compatible Devices for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cardiomyopathies,"Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a non-invasive imaging technique with exquisite soft-tissue detail for the
assessment of heart structure and function and provides an excellent screening tool but cannot always obviate
more invasive procedures, such as endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). Interventional CMR (iCMR) is a minimally
invasive technique without radiation, which has been hampered by the lack of non-ferrous devices that can be
easily visualized, enabling the navigation of tasks, such as EMB, safely. Currently, one in nine deaths in the
US is attributed to heart failure (HF), with health care costs exceeding $30 billion in 2013. Of the ~5.1 million
Americans with HF, the definitive treatment is heart transplantation (HTx), where rejection is assessed with
endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) – a procedure performed under X-ray guidance to obtain random samples of the
right ventricular septum. However, many patients, especially children with cardiomyopathy and after HTx and
HF caused by non-ischemic cardiomyopathies (NICM), do not have global changes to the myocardium, but
rather, patchy disease, which is often restricted to limited portions of the left ventricle. Thus, EMB may yield a
definitive diagnosis in <20% of the cases. As complications of EMB include ventricular puncture, pericardial
tamponade, stroke, and death, the risk-benefit ratio of EMB limits its use. However, accurate diagnosis of
cardiomyopathies or early recognition of heart rejection can lead to definitive treatment or measures to avoid
heart rejection, respectively, with enormous individual patient impact. Therefore, we propose to develop an
MRI-compatible suite of interventional devices to allow direct targeting of diseased myocardium (based on
CMR) for EMB and treatment of cardiomyopathies, for both right- and left-sided catheterization. To this end,
we will develop an active pigtail catheter with a guidewire for iCMR cardiac catheterization to be used in
combination with an active MR-steerable sheath/bioptome device or transmyocardial injection catheter. These
devices will enable direct targeting of the disease to increase diagnostic yield and decrease complications.
Currently, there are no commercially available active MR-visible EMB, pigtail, or injection catheters. Significant
advances to our realization of a clinically relevant MR-EMB device include the creation of a sharp-jaw EMB
mechanism that is safe from heating, but provides a specific MR signature when the device is open vs. closed,
and injection devices that can determine myocardial apposition so that therapeutics reach the intended target
of the myocardium. Furthermore, as pediatric HTx patients receive up to six EMBs in the first year, the iCMR
suite of devices will significantly reduce ionizing radiation in a particularly vulnerable population. Our research
proposal will develop these devices in a canine model of spontaneous NICM that is similar in size to children's
hearts to ensure these are compatible with pediatric interventions. Our extensive expertise in MRI
interventional devices and CMR will be used to achieve this objective. Thus, our goal will be to develop these
MR-guided devices to expand the reach of iCMR to children and adults.","<0-11 years old><21+ years old><3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><7 year old><7 years of age><Accuracy of Diagnosis><Adult><Adult

REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke-Myocardial Infarction-4 (REGARDS-MI-4),REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke-Myocardial Infarction-4 (REGARDS-MI-4),"Black-White coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart failure (HF) disparities persist in the US despite decades
of research and national public health campaigns. The role of social determinants of health (SDH) like struc-
tural racism in health disparities has been studied in only 1% of published work. Few studies of SDH have
taken a life course perspective related to risk of CHD and HF. The ability to recover after the stress of an acute
health event, or resilience, is an important patient-centered outcome, but the influence of SDH on resilience is
unknown. Few past studies have examined both structural and intermediary SDH in the World Health Organi-
zation’s (WHO) Commission on SDH (WHOCSD) conceptual framework in a longitudinal national sample with
rigorously adjudicated CHD and HF endpoints, which is one of the aims of this proposal. We propose a series
of studies to fill these gaps, while also providing rigorously adjudicated CHD and HF events and causes of
death to a host of investigators interested in using these data (to date, over 500 have used these data). We
build on a track record of mentoring to propose a formal year-long career development program for early-stage
investigators (ESI), especially underrepresented minorities (URM). The specific aims of this proposal are to:
(Aim 1) conduct studies examining underlying mechanisms of health disparities, guided by the WHOCSD con-
ceptual framework, in three thematic areas: a) the incidence and recurrence of CHD; b) the incidence and re-
currence of HF with preserved ejection fraction and HF with reduced ejection fraction; c) reserve and resilience
after an incident or recurrent CHD or HF event. (Aim 2) To continue to adjudicate CHD events, HF hospitaliza-
tions, and causes of death to support a wide range of studies by investigators beyond our group, and to link the
cohort with Medicare data to support investigators conducting health services utilization studies. (Aim 3) To
support the development of researchers in CVD health equity, especially URMs, through a new mentored re-
search program for a cohort of ESIs, including analytic and statistical support and an annual 2-day Health Eq-
uity Research Summer Institute of presentations, training, mock study section, and networking. ESIs will gradu-
ate with specific competencies in CVD health equity research. The proposed grant will inform policy, advocacy,
and the design of interventions by generating new evidence on which SDH and disparities in health services
lead to population-level disparities in incident and recurrent CHD and HF, and on resilience in recovery after a
CHD or HF event. Our multidisciplinary team includes epidemiologists, sociologists, health services research-
ers, biostatisticians, clinicians, and a participant Advisory Board, assuring rigor and relevance of the proposed
research. Continued funding for the REGARDS-MI infrastructure will support a host of additional studies led by
an expanding group of investigators. Funding will also expand the cadre of researchers dedicated to discover-
ing strategies to achieve health equity for all US adults, a goal supported by NHLBI, the National Academy of
Sciences, the CDC, the American Heart Association, and all major professional societies in the US.","<21+ years old><Adult><Adult Human><Advocacy><Affect><American Heart Association><Area><Black><Black race><Cardiac Diseases><Cardiac Disorders><Cardiac infarction><Cause of Death><Competence><Coronary Disease><Coronary heart disease><Data><Dedications><Development><Disparities><Disparity><EFRAC><Ejection Fraction><Epidemiologist><Event><Funding><Goals><Grant><Health><Health Campaign><Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18><Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18><Health Services><Health equity research><Heart Diseases><Heart failure><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Incidence><Infrastructure><Investigators><Lead><Life Cycle><Life Cycle Stages><Link><Measures><Medicare><Mentors><Mentorship><Myocardial Infarct><Myocardial Infarction><NHLBI><National Academy of Sciences><National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute><Outcome><Participant><Patient outcome><Patient-Centered Outcomes><Patient-Focused Outcomes><Pb element><Policies><Population><Professional Organizations><Program Development><Public Health><Publishing><Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke><Recovery><Recurrence><Recurrent><Research><Research Personnel><Research in health equity><Researchers><Risk><Role><Sampling><Series><Structural Racism><Study Section><Title 18><Training><Underrepresented Ethnic Minority><Underrepresented Minority><United States National Academy of Sciences><Work><World Health Organization><acute stress><adjudication><adjudicative process and procedure><adulthood><atherosclerotic heart disease><cardiac failure><cardiac infarct><career><career development><cohort><coronary attack><coronary disorder><coronary infarct><coronary infarction><design><designing><developmental><disparity in health><health disparity><health equity><health equity-focused research><health insurance for disabled><health service use><health service utilization><heart attack><heart disorder><heart failure and reduced ejection fraction><heart failure with reduced ejection fraction><heart infarct><heart infarction><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><interest><intervention design><life course><multidisciplinary><patient oriented outcomes><preservation><professional association><professional membership><professional society><programs><research on health equity><research related to health equity><research to attain health equity><resilience><resilient><social health determinants><social influence><social role><sociologist><summer institute><therapy design><treatment design><under-representation of minorities><under-represented minority><underrepresentation of minorities>",Aging; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease; Neurosciences; Racial and Ethnic Minority Health Research; Social Determinants of Health
"Understanding the role of bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) in pediatric acute asthma exacerbations: A prospective, randomized, double blind, controlled trial.","Understanding the role of bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) in pediatric acute asthma exacerbations: A prospective, randomized, double blind, controlled trial.","Asthma remains one of the top three causes of hospitalization in children in the United States. Interventions that
rapidly reverse bronchial obstruction and decrease the need for continuous beta-agonist therapy will not only
directly benefit the patient, but also decrease the consumption of acute care resources. Bilevel positive airway
pressure (BPAP) is a form of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation that may stent open airways, improve
mucous clearance, recruit alveoli, and increase responsiveness to continuous beta-agonist therapy in the small
distal airways. However, BPAP is not currently part of the NIH guidelines for the management of pediatric acute
asthma secondary to the lack of quality pediatric clinical trials. The goal of this prospective, randomized, double
blind, controlled trial is to determine if early initiation of BPAP is effective and safe in pediatric patients presenting
to a pediatric emergency department with acute moderate to severe asthma exacerbations who fail first line

"Manufacturable Biomimetic Microfluidic Oxygenator for Safer, Simpler Treatment of Respiratory Failure","Manufacturable Biomimetic Microfluidic Oxygenator for Safer, Simpler Treatment of Respiratory Failure","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This Fast Track STTR project focuses on developing and demonstrating a high-volume manufacturing
technology for microfluidic oxygenators for applications requiring ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation
(ECMO) to treat respiratory failure. Unlike heart disease and cancer, mortality from lung diseases continue to
rise, and a combination of increasing patient populations suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
and acute lung injury associated with respiratory infectious diseases and trauma represent an enormous health
care challenge in the US and across the world. The gold standard treatment for respiratory failure, invasive
mechanical ventilation, carries significant risks of mechanical and biochemical injury to the lung along with
microbial exposure. As a result, ECMO has emerged as an alternative therapy that allows injured lungs to rest,
directly oxygenating and removing carbon dioxide from the blood in an extracorporeal circuit. However, ECMO
use is limited due to the extreme complexity of the blood circuit, which includes a hollow fiber membrane
oxygenator (HFMO) as the functional unit, and bioinspired microfluidic oxygenators capable of more safely
oxygenating the blood have emerged. Our preliminary data demonstrates the first large-scale, extended duration
microfluidic oxygenators in large animals, with distinct safety and efficacy advantages over HFMO, but the
method of construction is very complex and costly. We have engaged with high precision injection molding
companies to identify a path to produce the devices at high volume and low cost, and the focus here is to develop
and demonstrate the injection molded microfluidic oxygenator technology in safety and efficacy studies in a
porcine model. Toward this end, we propose a fast track proposal comprising two phases and four overall aims.
In Phase I, we will 1) Define the target product profile for the adult clinical scale microfluidic oxygenator and
conduct fluid mechanical and thermal modeling to identify the process window required for high yield injection
molding of these devices, 2) Iteratively apply computational models to verify the oxygen transfer and blood flow,
pressure and shear properties of oxygenators resulting from these designs, and 3) Build a casted replica of the
injection molding design to confirm gas transfer performance. Successful identification of a microfluidic
oxygenator design that meets the requirements from manufacturability, cost and performance perspectives will
lead to advancement to Phase II of the program. Here we will 1) Fabricate the injection molds required for
fabrication or larger numbers of microfluidic oxygenators at pediatric and adult scale, and 2) Test these pediatric
and adult scale oxygenators in extended duration studies in porcine models to confirm safety and efficacy in
comparison with HFMO control devices. This demonstration of safety and efficacy, enabled by the high-volume
injection molding process developed on this project, will accelerate the advancement of the technology toward
commercialization and clinical translation for treatment of critically ill patients suffering from respiratory failure.",<21+ years old><3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><ARDS><Acceleration><Acute><Acute Lung Injury><Acute Pulmonary Injury><Acute Respiratory Distress><Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome><Address><Adult><Adult ARDS><Adult Human><Adult RDS><Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome><Airway failure><Alternative Therapies><Alternative intervention><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Animals><Biochemical><Biological Mimetics><Biomimetics><Bleeding><Blood><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Blood flow><CO2><COPD><COVID-19><CV-19><Cancers><Carbon Dioxide><Carbonic Anhydride><Cardiac Diseases><Cardiac Disorders><Childhood><Chronic><Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease><Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease><Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease><Chronic lung disease><Clinical><Communicable Diseases><Complex><Complication><Computer Models><Computerized Models><Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019><Critical Illness><Critically Ill><Da Nang Lung><Data><Death Rate><Development><Devices><Drops><Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation><Family suidae><Fiber><Filamentous Fungi><Future><Gases><Goals><Hand><Health Care Systems><Healthcare><Healthcare Systems><Heart Diseases><Hemorrhage><Hour><Housing><Human Resources><In Vitro><Infectious Disease Pathway><Infectious Diseases><Infectious Disorder><Injections><Injury><Intubation><Laboratories><Liquid substance><Lung><Lung Diseases><Lung Respiratory System><Lung damage><Lung infections><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Manpower><Marketing><Mechanical ventilation><Mechanics><Medical><Membrane Oxygenators><Methods><Microcirculation><Microfluidics><Modeling><Molds><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><O element><O2 element><Oxygen><Oxygenators><Patients><Performance><Phase><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiology><Pigs><Polymers><Preclinical Testing><Procedures><Process><Property><Pulmonary Diseases><Pulmonary Disorder><Qualifying><Research><Respiratory Disease><Respiratory Failure><Respiratory System Disease><Respiratory System Disorder><Rest><Risk><STTR><Safety><Sedation procedure><Shock Lung><Small Business Technology Transfer Research><Specific qualifier value><Specified><Stiff lung><Suidae><Swine><System><Technology><Testing><Thrombus><Translations><Trauma><Tube><United States><Validation><adulthood><artificial lung><blood loss><chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder><chronic pulmonary disease><clinical translation><clinically translatable><combat injury><combat related injury><commercial application><commercialization><computational modeling><computational models><computer based models><computerized modeling><coronavirus disease 2019><coronavirus disease-19><coronavirus infectious disease-19><cost><cost effective><design><designing><developmental><disease of the lung><disorder of the lung><efficacy study><fabrication><fabrication technology><first in man><first-in-human><fluid><full scale manufacturing><hands><health care><heart disorder><hemocompatibility><high level production><high scale production><high volume manufacturing><high volume production><injured><injuries><innovate><innovation><innovative><interest><large scale manufacturing><large scale production><liquid><lung disorder><lung injury><malignancy><manufacturability><manufacturing process><manufacturing technology><mass production><mechanic><mechanical><mechanical respiratory assist><mechanically ventilated><microbial><microfluidic technology><model of animal><mortality><mortality rate><mortality ratio><neoplasm/cancer><new technology><novel technologies><pandemic><pandemic disease><patient population><pediatric><personnel><pig model><piglet model><polymer><polymeric><porcine><porcine model><pre-clinical><pre-clinical testing><preclinical><pressure><programs><prototype><pulmonary><pulmonary damage><pulmonary infections><pulmonary injury><pulmonary tissue damage><pulmonary tissue injury><respiratory><response><safety study><scale up><sedation><standard care><standard treatment><suid><swine model><three dimensional><thrombotic><translation><validations><wet lung><µfluidic><µfluidic technology>,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Lung; Rare Diseases
Personalized Prediction of Cardiovascular Outcomes through Machine Learning Analysis of Cardiac MRI and Genomics,Personalized Prediction of Cardiovascular Outcomes through Machine Learning Analysis of Cardiac MRI and Genomics,"Scientific Abstract
Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP) is a condition of aging that has been associated with
increased risk of heart disease and heart failure. CHIP is evaluated by DNA sequencing of peripheral blood.
However, not all patients with CHIP will develop heart failure or myocardial infarction. Our preliminary data
demonstrate that CHIP patients (cancer and non-cancer patients) have a higher burden of nonischemic scarring
in their hearts on cardiac MRI compared to patients without CHIP. In a pilot cohort using a machine learning
technique of convolutional neural networks (CNN), we are able to predict who have CHIP with 86% accuracy
and predicted future cardiomyopathy with an accuracy of 73%, thus opening the door to possible image guided
risk stratification for identifying patients with CHIP as well as predict future cardiac outcomes. We also find
through our novel deep learning algorithm that we can identify extended somatic variants that are CHIP-like that
can impact heart failure outcomes and through integration of patient data, genomic and imaging signatures, we
are able to develop partition risk scores that can weigh the variables such as CHIP and their contribution to heart
failure and the pathways involved. We hypothesize that using cardiac MRI, novel machine learning
techniques on large imaging datasets can identify CHIP vs non-CHIP patients as well as predict who will
develop adverse cardiovascular outcomes and that CNNs can be used on both imaging and genomic
signatures in large cohorts like the TOPMED, UKB and All of Us to predict cardiovascular outcomes
while pathway analyses will reveal mechanisms and novel targets for CHIP-mediated cardiomyopathy
Specific Aim #1 will use a novel CNN with multi-view cross-attention to identify MRI features that can accurately
predict CHIP as well as future adverse outcomes such as heart failure and myocardial infarction that will be
validated in large datasets like TOPMed, UKB and All of Us with a collective ~13000 cardiac MRIs. Specific Aim

Precision imaging of electromechanical coupling for non-invasive cardiac arrhythmia mapping,Precision imaging of electromechanical coupling for non-invasive cardiac arrhythmia mapping,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality affecting over 5% of Americans. Arrhythmias
have become increasingly prevalent due to an aging population with diabetes, heart failure and hypertension,
which has led to an increasing number of invasive electrophysiology studies and catheter ablations. Our grasp
of the cardiac arrhythmia mechanism, if it is focal or reentrant, and the specific location of the arrhythmia origin
is limited by the current first-line, standard of care, noninvasive diagnostic test — the 12-lead electrocardiogram
(ECG), which is dependent on physician subjective interpretation. Furthermore, it does not present the
arrhythmia in an easily visualized, three-dimensional, anatomical manner for patients or physicians to
understand. Other noninvasive mapping techniques such as ECG imaging (ECGI) or virtual-heart technology,
requires additional preprocedural imaging such as computed tomography which exposes patient to radiation, or
magnetic resonance imaging which is costly. Over ten years, the collaborative team effort between Cardiac
Electrophysiology and Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, has developed
Electromechanical Wave Imaging (EWI), an ultrasound-based technique that takes 10-15 minute to non-
invasively image arrhythmias by visualizing the electromechanical wave corresponding to electromechanical
coupling. We have now developed a new technique, a full 3D EWI noninvasive ultrasound technique which can
construct an entire 4 chamber cardiac activation map using a single heartbeat of arrhythmia acquired in one
apical transthoracic echocardiographic image. We propose three aims which will validate non-invasive 3D EWI
to high density activation maps (HDAM) acquired during invasive electrophysiology study and demonstrate its
clinical impact to shorten procedural times and improve clinical outcomes in a randomized clinical trial. We will
demonstrate that 3D EWI is an invaluable tool for pre-ablation planning to (1) provide target localization, (2)
diagnose the mechanism of the arrhythmia, as focal or macro-reentrant arrhythmia, useful in decision-making
for systemic anticoagulation and (3) improve ablation outcomes. We will study patients with manifest pre-
excitation such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, premature atrial complexes,
premature ventricular complexes and ventricular tachycardia at two clinical sites, Columbia University (NY, NY)
and Mount Sinai Medical Center (NY, NY). This project presents a strong team with imaging expertise in
ultrasonography, clinical cardiac electrophysiology and biostatistics. Using a collaborative, multi-disciplinary and
integrated experimental approach we will clinically validate noninvasive 3D EWI with invasive 3D HDAM and
deliver a translational and transformative technique with immediate clinical impact that will enable personalized
imaging for ablation of cardiac arrhythmias.","<21+ years old><3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><Ablation><Accuracy of Diagnosis><Adolescent><Adolescent Youth><Adopted><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><American><Anatomic Sites><Anatomic structures><Anatomy><Anticoagulation><Apical><Apoplexy><Area><Arrhythmia><Atrial><Atrial Ectopic Beats><Atrial Extrasystole><Atrial Flutter><Atrial Premature Complexes><Atrial Premature Complices><Atrial Tachycardia><Auricular Flutter><Biomedical Engineering><Biometrics><Biometry><Biostatistics><Brain Vascular Accident><Bypass><CAT scan><CT X Ray><CT Xray><CT imaging><CT scan><Cardiac><Cardiac Arrhythmia><Cardiac Atrium><Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques><Cardiac Electrophysiological Diagnostics><Cardiac ablation><Catheter Ablation><Cerebral Stroke><Cerebrovascular Apoplexy><Cerebrovascular Stroke><Clinical><Clinical Trials><Computed Tomography><Consumption><Coupling><Data><Decision Making><Diabetes Mellitus><Diagnosis><Diagnostic tests><ECG><EKG><Echocardiogram><Echocardiography><Echography><Echotomography><Electrocardiogram><Electrocardiography><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><False bundle-branch block syndrome><Grips><Heart><Heart Arrhythmias><Heart Atrium><Heart failure><Hypertension><Image><Imaging Procedures><Imaging Technics><Imaging Techniques><Laboratories><Lateral><Lead><Left><Lesion><Location><MR Imaging><MR Tomography><MRI><MRIs><Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Maps><Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance><Medical Ultrasound><Medical center><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><NMR Imaging><NMR Tomography><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Outcome><Patient Schedules><Patients><Pattern><Pb element><Persons><Physicians><Premature Atrial Beats><Premature Atrial Contractions><Premature Supraventricular Beats><Premature Ventricular Beats><Premature Ventricular Contractions><Procedures><Public Health><Radiation><Randomization trial><Randomized><Recommendation><Recurrence><Recurrent><Reproducibility><Resolution><Stroke><Techniques><Technology><Therapeutic><Time><Tomodensitometry><Transthoracic Echocardiography><Ultrasonic Imaging><Ultrasonogram><Ultrasonography><Ultrasound Diagnosis><Ultrasound Medical Imaging><Ultrasound Test><United States><Universities><Vascular Hypertensive Disease><Vascular Hypertensive Disorder><Ventricular><Ventricular Ectopic Beats><Ventricular Extrasystole><Ventricular Premature Complexes><Ventricular Premature Complices><Ventricular Tachycardia><Visualization><WPW Syndrome><Wolf-Parkinson-White Syndrome><Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome><X-Ray CAT Scan><X-Ray Computed Tomography><X-Ray Computerized Tomography><Xray CAT scan><Xray Computed Tomography><Xray computerized tomography><Zeugmatography><adulthood><aged group><aged groups><aged individual><aged individuals><aged people><aged person><aged persons><aged population><aged populations><aging population><anatomic imaging><anatomical imaging><atrium><bio-engineered><bio-engineers><bioengineering><biological engineering><brain attack><cardiac electrophysiology><cardiac failure><catscan><cerebral vascular accident><cerebrovascular accident><clinical research site><clinical site><computed axial tomography><computer tomography><computerized axial tomography><computerized tomography><cost><density><design><designing><diabetes><diagnostic ability><diagnostic accuracy><diagnostic capability><diagnostic power><diagnostic ultrasound><diagnostic utility><diagnostic value><electrophysiological><grasp><heart electrophysiology><heart sonography><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><hemodynamics><high blood pressure><high dimensionality><hyperpiesia><hyperpiesis><hypertensive disease><hypertensive disorder><image guidance><image guided><image-based method><imaging><imaging method><imaging modality><improved><improved outcome><innovate><innovation><innovative><juvenile><juvenile human><mortality><multidisciplinary><non-contrast CT><non-invasive diagnosis><non-invasive diagnostic><non-invasive imaging><noncontrast CT><noncontrast computed tomography><noninvasive diagnosis><noninvasive diagnostic><noninvasive imaging><patient population><personalization of treatment><personalized medicine><personalized therapy><personalized treatment><population aging><portability><pre-clinical study><preclinical study><prospective><public health relevance><randomisation><randomization><randomized trial><randomized, clinical trials><randomly assigned><resolutions><secondary analysis><sonogram><sonography><sound measurement><standard of care><stroked><strokes><three dimensional><tool><ultrasound><ultrasound imaging><ultrasound scanning><virtual>",Biomedical Imaging; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Heart Disease
"Development of a Minimally Invasive Single Cannulation, Compact Single Port Pulsatile Ventricular Assist Device (sppVAD) for Total LV Support","Development of a Minimally Invasive Single Cannulation, Compact Single Port Pulsatile Ventricular Assist Device (sppVAD) for Total LV Support","Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a serious condition of low cardiac output with a 40-50% mortality. In severe CS,
hypoperfusion causes multi-organ failure and high left ventricle (LV) preload/wall stress exacerbates cardiac
injury/prevents recovery. Temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is needed to restore perfusion and
unload the LV, bridging the CS patient to recovery, long-term LV assist device (LVAD), or heart transplant.
Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is most often used in severe CS, but it fails to unload LV
in > 50% of these patients with no improved outcomes. Minimally invasive, percutaneous MCS devices also do
not improve severe CS outcomes since they do not completely restore the circulation. Non-percutaneous MCS
devices provide total support but require open chest surgery and are not ambulation friendly. Impella 5.5 has
become the preferred MCS device for CS. Yet, patients with an Impella 5.5 must stay in ICU with very limited
ambulation. Thus, a big market gap exists for an ideal temporary MCS device that: 1) is minimally invasive, 2)
provides total LV support, and 3) enables easy ambulation. Our goal is to develop a new temporary MCS
system that provides total LV support via a minimally invasive technique with easy ambulation, enabling patient
discharge for at-home MCS. Our device will provide one month MCS (potential for up to 3 months) to bridge
severe CS patient to further treatment, recovery, durable VAD, or heart transplant. Our enabling technology
is a single port, pulsatile ventricular assist device (sppVAD) system that includes valved single lumen cannula
(VSLC), valveless single port diaphragm displacement pump (spDDP), and compact/portable console. Our
sppVAD system has following novel design:1) One VSLC for withdrawal and infusion; 2) single lumen design
doubles usable area to reduce circuit blood resistance for >6 L/min pumping; 3) One transapical to aorta
cannulation for minimally invasive installation; 4) Only one port reduces pump size for easy ambulation; 5)
Simple valveless pump geometry for better durability and 1-month MCS. In the Phase I SBIR, our sppVAD
system achieved >6 L/min pulsatile flow in bench test and 6 hr total LV unloading in sheep. Specific Aim 1:
Optimize and fabricate VSLC, valveless spDDP, and compact/portable console for the sppVAD system.
The VSLC will be made of reinforced polyurethane (PU). Inlet valves will be in LV for blood withdrawal. A tri-
leaflet outlet valve on VSLC tip will be in aorta for blood delivery. The spDDP will be made of polycarbonate
with a PU diaphragm. A compact/portable console will also be developed. Specific Aim 2: Bench test the
sppVAD system for performance, durability, and hemocompatibility. The sppVAD system will be tested in
mock loop for performance/durability and in an in vitro loop with bovine blood to quantify hemolysis. Specific
Aim 3: Perform 4-week preclinical testing of sppVAD system in sheep. A near commercial quality sppVAD
system will be tested in sheep (n=10) for safety/biocompatibility/reliability. Our novel sppVAD system fills a
large unmet need for ambulatory, at-home temporary total LV support to improve patient outcomes.",<Aorta><Apical><Area><Artificial Heart Ventricle><Artificial Ventricles><Assistive Technology><Biotech><Biotechnology><Blood><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Bovine Species><Cannulas><Cannulations><Cardiac><Cardiac Transplantation><Cardiogenic Shock><Cattle><Circulation><Clinical><Dedications><Development><Development and Research><Devices><Diaphragm><Discharge from Health Care Facility><Discharge from Healthcare Facility><Drainage><Drainage procedure><Engineering><Ensure><Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation><Failure><Friends><Geometry><Goals><Heart><Heart Grafting><Heart Injuries><Heart Transplantation><Hemolysis><Home><Housing><In Vitro><Infusion><Infusion procedures><Kentucky><Laboratory Animal Production and Facilities><Left Ventricles><Left ventricular structure><Life><Low Cardiac Output><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><MOF syndrome><Marketing><Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome><Multiple Organ Failure><Organ><Ostamer><Outcome><Ovine><Ovis><Patient Discharge><Patient outcome><Patient-Centered Outcomes><Patient-Focused Outcomes><Patients><Pellethane><Performance><Perfusion><Phase><Polyisocyanates><Polyurethanes><Preclinical Testing><Pulsatile Flow><Pulsatile Perfusion><Pulsating Flow><Pump><R & D><R&D><Recovery><Research Animal Facility><Resistance><Respiratory Diaphragm><SBIR><Safety><Scientist><Self-Help Devices><Sheep><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Social Support System><Stress><Support System><Surgeon><System><Techniques><Technology><Testing><Thoracic Surgery><Thoracic Surgical Procedures><Universities><Ventricle-Assist Device><Withdrawal><ascending aorta><assisted device><assistive device><biocompatibility><biomaterial compatibility><bovid><bovine><cardiac graft><cardiac injury><cardiac shock><chest surgery><commercialization><cow><design><designing><developmental><erythrolysis><experience><fabrication><flexibility><flexible><heart transplant><hemocompatibility><homes><hypoperfusion><implantation><improved><improved outcome><in vivo><infusions><injury to the myocardium><innovate><innovation><innovative><invention><mechanical cardiac support><mechanical circulatory assist><mechanical circulatory support><mechanical circulatory therapy><mechanical heart support><minimally invasive><mortality><multidisciplinary><multiorgan failure><multiple organ system failure><myocardial injury><novel><patient oriented outcomes><polycarbonate><portability><pre-clinical testing><prevent><preventing><pulmonary><purge><purges><purging><research and development><resistant><restoration><usability><ventricular assist device>,Assistive Technology; Bioengineering; Cardiovascular; Heart Disease
SPORE in Breast Cancer,SPORE in Breast Cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: OVERALL
Using the well-established framework of a very active and strong multidisciplinary Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer
Center (VICC) Breast Cancer Program that is robustly supported by the SPORE mechanism, we have made
significant progress in our current project period. With supplemental funding, our overall goal remains the
same: To conduct collaborative, multidisciplinary and mechanism-based translational research that will have
the highest possible impact on women and men with or at risk for breast cancer. After planning and internal
and external advisory board evaluation, we propose to continue our research on three translational projects,
primarily targeting triple-negative breast cancer, with integrated guidance from patient advocates, to ensure
that we are inclusive of the patient perspective in meeting our goals. The projects are as follows: Project 2 -
Strategies to Improve Outcomes for TNBC Patients Integrating Subtype-specific Genomic and Immune-based
Discoveries; Project 4 - Targeting Antigen Presentation to Improve Immunotherapy Responses in Breast
Cancer; and Project 5 – Liquid Biopsies to Guide Therapies in Triple-Negative Breast Cancers. The projects
require three highly integrated shared core resources: Administration and Engagement, Biostatistics and
Bioinformatics, and Pathology and Tissue Informatics. The cores bring innovative technology, resources, and
personnel with project-specific expertise to the overall VICC Breast SPORE Program and do not duplicate pre-
existing shared resources available at VICC or Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). We have an
expert multidisciplinary team that will accomplish the proposed aims and continue to have productive
translational collaborations with other Breast Cancer Programs, SPOREs, and national and international
groups.",<Academic Medical Centers><Administrative Coordination><Advocate><Affect><Agonist><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Animals><Antigen Presentation><Antigen Targeting><Atlases><Bio-Informatics><Bioinformatics><Biometrics><Biometry><Biostatistics><Blood Sample><Blood specimen><Body Fluids><Body Tissues><Breast><Breast Cancer><Breast Cancer Risk Factor><Breast Neoplasms><Breast Tissue><Breast Tumors><CLIA accredited><CLIA approved><CLIA certified><CLIA compliant><CLIA licensed><Cancer Center><Cell Line><CellLine><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Clinical Trials><Collaborations><Collection><Communication><Consent><Consult><Data><Data Analyses><Data Analysis><Data Banks><Data Bases><Databanks><Databases><Development><Development and Research><Diagnostic><Document Type><Enrollment><Ensure><Epithelium><Evaluation><Experimental Designs><Financial Management><Fostering><Funding><Genes><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic defect><Genomics><Goals><Histology><Human Resources><Immune><Immune mediated therapy><Immunes><Immunohistochemistry><Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue><Immunohistochemistry Staining Method><Immunologically Directed Therapy><Immunomodulation><Immunotherapy><Informatics><International><Investigators><Laboratories><Malignant Breast Neoplasm><Mammary Cancer><Mammary Gland Parenchyma><Mammary Gland Tissue><Mammary Neoplasms><Manpower><Manuscripts><Medical><Methods><Monitor><Mutation><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Occupational activity of managing finances><Organoids><Pathologic><Pathology><Patient Participation><Patients><Policies><Process><Productivity><Prognostic Marker><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Publications><Quality Control><R & D><R&D><R-Series Research Projects><R01 Mechanism><R01 Program><Regulation><Report (document)><Reporting><Reproduction spores><Research><Research Design><Research Grants><Research Personnel><Research Project Grants><Research Projects><Research Resources><Researchers><Resource Sharing><Resources><Sample Size><Scientific Publication><Services><Spores><Standardization><Strains Cell Lines><Study Type><TNBC><Tissues><Training><Translational Research><Translational Science><United States National Institutes of Health><University Medical Centers><Woman><Work><Writing><anti-cancer research><breast cancer risk><cancer research><compare to control><comparison control><consults><cultured cell line><data base><data depository><data interpretation><data quality><data repository><data set repository><dataset repository><depository><developmental><enroll><gene panel><genome mutation><immune modulation><immune regulation><immune therapeutic approach><immune therapeutic interventions><immune therapeutic regimens><immune therapeutic strategy><immune therapy><immune-based therapies><immune-based treatments><immuno therapy><immunologic reactivity control><immunomodulatory><immunoregulation><immunoregulatory><improved><improved outcome><innovative technologies><liquid biopsy><malignant breast tumor><mammary tumor><meeting><meetings><men><model of animal><molecular diagnostics><multidisciplinary><multigene panel><personnel><prognostic biomarker><programs><recruit><repository><research and development><response><response to therapy><response to treatment><study design><therapeutic response><therapy response><tool><translation research><translational investigation><translational study><treatment response><treatment responsiveness><triple-negative breast cancer><triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma><tumor>,Breast Cancer; Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Immunotherapy; Prevention; Women's Health Research
Tau Oligomeric Complex 1 Antibody as a Novel Immuno-Gene Therapy for Tauopathy.,Tau Oligomeric Complex 1 Antibody as a Novel Immuno-Gene Therapy for Tauopathy.,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Oligomeric tau species are a central instigator of dysfunction and degeneration in tauopathies, a group of
degenerative conditions encompassing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (i.e. tauopathies).
Several passive and active anti-tau immunotherapeutics are currently undergoing preclinical and clinical testing,
and there are high hopes for efficacy. However, substantial concerns exist because of the possibility that many
of these agents are not specific for the right target (e.g., bind total or physiological tau) and/or are not efficiently
delivered to the right location (i.e., not intraneuronal). As an alternative strategy, we propose leveraging gene
therapy for the delivery of single chain fragment variables (scFvs) derived from an anti-Tau Oligomeric Complex
1 (TOC1) antibody, will specifically target a toxic tau species (right targets) and provide robust intraneuronal
delivery non-invasively into the brain (right place). TOC1 specifically recognizes a conformation-dependent
epitope in tau, necessitating tau dimerization or the formation of higher-order multimeric oligomers. Tau
oligomers are considered one of the earliest forms of tau pathology to emerge in human disease and are directly
linked to several cellular mechanisms causing neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Given the pivotal role of
oligomeric tau in disease pathogenesis, they are a prime target for therapeutic intervention. Using recombinant
adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), we will deliver TOC1-scFv coupled to HaloTag protein and a proteasome
degradation signal (PDS) peptide for ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated breakdown of oligomeric tau. Advanced
AAVs like the AAV CAP-B10 capsid provide a novel non-invasive route for systemic AAV delivery. We will deliver
AAV-TOC1-scFv coupled to HaloTag protein and a proteasome degradation signaling (PDS) peptide for
ubiquitin-proteasome system-mediated breakdown of oligomeric tau species. We will test the hypothesis that
TOC1-scFv-Halo-PDS will bind and target oligomeric tau species for degradation (Aim 1A), and systemic AAV-
TOC1-scFv-Halo-PDS will efficiently express the scFv intraneuronally, subsequently rescuing the phenotype in
a mouse model of tauopathy (i.e. PS19 mutant tau mice; Aim 1B). Aim 1A involves the generation and validation
of TOC1-scFv-Halo-PDS via assessing different scFv configurations (heavy chain/light chain and light
chain/heavy chain) and measuring target engagement utilizing in-cell protein-protein interaction assays in a cell
model of tauopathy. Aim 1B focuses on delivering TOC1-scFv-Halo-PDS using the AAV-CAP-B10 viral vector
for non-invasive systemic delivery and widespread CNS expression in PS19 mice. Expression in the CNS and
peripheral organs will be tested using wild-type mice. Subsequently, a disease prevention study (AAV delivery
in early disease) and a disease-modifying study (AAV delivery in mid-disease) will be conducted in PS19 mice.
Cognitive performance, scFv expression, target engagement, neurodegeneration (neurons, synapses, etc.), tau
neuropathology and neuroinflammation will be measured. Successful project completion will conclusively
determine the potential of AAV-TOC1-scFv-Halo-PDS as a highly novel immuno-gene therapy for tauopathy.",<20S Catalytic Proteasome><20S Core Proteasome><20S Proteasome><20S Proteosome><AAV

Searching for the Goldilocks Zone of  Innate Immunity in Alzheimer's Disease,Searching for the Goldilocks Zone of  Innate Immunity in Alzheimer's Disease,"Immunoproteostasis refers to the relationship between the immune system, proteinopathies present in many
neurodegenerative disorders, and brain cell dysfunction. The relevance of immunoproteostasis to Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) is supported by genetic, pathological, and modeling studies. In AD, as in cancer, multiple lines of evidence now
support the benefits of immune activating therapies, but for AD this concept is not settled science. More generally,
manipulation of the immune activation states regardless of “direction”, has potential for harm as well as benefit. The
overarching goal of these studies is to determine whether we can identify immune manipulations in preclinical models of
amyloid pathology that potentially fall within a “Goldilocks zone”- where disease modification, with minimal or no
damage, is achieved. We propose three aims that will test our global hypothesis that it is possible to identify immune
modulatory therapies that fall within a Goldilocks zone. In aim 1, we will systematically evaluate liabilities and benefits of
immune manipulations that have been shown to modulate immunoproteostasis in amyloid depositing mice. In aim 2, we
will survey a broader set of immune manipulations targeting putative microglial immune checkpoints to evaluate whether
a manipulation of any of these checkpoints falls within the Goldilocks zone. In aim 3, we will evaluate whether targeting
of immune modulating factors to the plaque microenvironment can maintain or increase beneficial impact on AD relevant
pathologies while reducing potential liabilities. Several overarching principles provide a framework for these studies. First,
as the balance of positive and negative effects of any immune manipulation may limit therapeutic benefit, we will use
transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, assessments of pathology, and assays of synaptic number and function to assess
disease modifying potential and liabilities more broadly and systematically. Second, we will focus on non-cell autonomous
manipulations of immune signaling pathways, as such studies are more likely to identify translatable interventions. Third,
we will evaluate whether we can increase efficacy and limit liabilities by more precisely targeting the immune
manipulations to the plaque microenvironment. The studies are highly translational, as they can validate novel approaches
to immune modulatory therapies for AD. Finally, these studies have relevance beyond the AD field, as they broadly explore
immune checkpoints in the brain and thus the data generated may inform studies relating to immuno-oncology of the
brain and other neuroimmune disorders.",<AD dementia><AD model><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer risk factor><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimer's disease model><Alzheimer's disease risk><Alzheimer's disease therapy><Alzheimer's therapy><Alzheimers Dementia><Amyloid><Amyloid Substance><Amyloid deposition><Assay><Benchmarking><Benefits and Risks><Best Practice Analysis><Bioassay><Biological><Biological Assay><Biology><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cancers><Chimera Protein><Chimeric Proteins><Clinical><Clinical Trials><Coupled><Data><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Deposit><Deposition><Disease><Disorder><Dysfunction><Encephalon><Equilibrium><Functional disorder><Fusion Protein><Gene variant><Genetic><Genetic study><Goals><Health system><Hortega cell><Human><Immune><Immune Cell Activation><Immune Modulation Therapy><Immune Targeting><Immune response><Immune signaling><Immune system><Immunes><Immunological response><Immunomodulation><Immunomodulators><Immunooncology><Immunosuppression><Immunosuppression Effect><Immunosuppressive Effect><Innate Immune System><Innate Immunity><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Link><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Measures><Mediating><Mice><Mice Mammals><Microglia><Mind><Modern Man><Modification><Murine><Mus><Native Immunity><Natural Immunity><Nervous System><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neuroimmune><Neurologic Body System><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neurologic Organ System><Non-Specific Immunity><Nonspecific Immunity><Passive Immunotherapy><Pathologic><Pathology><Pathway interactions><Peptide Domain><Physiopathology><Pre-Clinical Model><Preclinical Models><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Process><Protein Domains><Proteins><Proteomics><Receptor Protein><Recombinant adeno-associated virus><Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)><Risk><Role><Science><Signal Pathway><Study models><Survey Instrument><Surveys><Synapses><Synaptic><System><Tertiary Protein Structure><Testing><Therapeutic><Toxic effect><Toxicities><allele variant><allelic variant><alzheimer model><alzheimer risk><amyloid pathology><balance><balance function><benchmark><biologic><brain cell><clinical relevance><clinically relevant><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><design><designing><experience><falls><genetic variant><genomic variant><gitter cell><host response><immune activation><immune check point><immune checkpoint><immune modulating strategy><immune modulating therapies><immune modulation><immune modulators><immune modulatory strategy><immune modulatory therapies><immune regulation><immune suppression><immune suppressive activity><immune suppressive function><immune system response><immune-modulation treatment><immune-oncology><immunecheckpoint><immuno oncology><immunologic reactivity control><immunology oncology><immunomodulation therapy><immunomodulation treatment><immunomodulator therapies><immunomodulator treatment><immunomodulator-based therapies><immunomodulatory><immunomodulatory strategy><immunomodulatory therapies><immunomodulatory therapy><immunomodulatory treatment><immunoregulation><immunoregulatory><immunoresponse><immunosuppressive activity><immunosuppressive function><immunosuppressive response><improved><innate immune pathways><insight><interventional strategy><malignancy><mesoglia><microglial cell><microgliocyte><mouse model><multiomics><multiple omics><murine model><neoplasm/cancer><neurodegenerative illness><new approaches><new therapeutic approach><new therapeutic intervention><new therapeutic strategies><new therapy approaches><new treatment approach><new treatment strategy><novel><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><novel therapeutic approach><novel therapeutic intervention><novel therapeutic strategies><novel therapy approach><oncoimmunology><panomics><passive immune therapy><passive immunotherapeutics><pathophysiology><pathway><perivascular glial cell><pre-clinical study><preclinical study><primary degenerative dementia><rAAV><receptor><recombinant AAV><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><sex><social role><synapse><synapse function><synaptic function><synaptic pruning><transcriptomics><transgene delivery><vector>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Dementia; Immunotherapy; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences
RaceCAR-M immunotherapy for cancer and beyond,RaceCAR-M immunotherapy for cancer and beyond,"Cellular immunotherapies like Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells (CAR-T) extend the lives of
cancer patients who are otherwise out of options. These therapies represent a leap forward in
cancer treatment but suffer from severe limitations because 1) the tumor microenvironment
excludes and exhausts T cells including CAR-T cells, 2) some tumor cells escape by
downregulating the target antigen, 3) the therapy incites cytokine storms and autoimmune
reactions, and 4) cellular therapies are currently complex, time-consuming, and exorbitantly
expensive. Here we propose to overcome these limitations and thereby revolutionize,
generalize, and democratize cellular immunotherapies. A promising new cellular immunotherapy
approach is CAR-M (macrophage). Two Phase 1 clinical trials are in progress and it is clear that
the approach is safe though there is substantial room for improvement in efficacy. While CAR-M
has many advantages over CAR-T, it is clear that it would be of great value to enhance the
capacity of CAR macrophages to attack and kill cancer cells while sparing normal tissue. Based
on fundamental cell and developmental biology we have been doing in fruit flies, we discovered
how to greatly increase the ability of human macrophages to attack and kill specific whole target
cells of our choosing. Inspired by our discovery in fruit flies, we have been able to engineer
mouse and human macrophages to avidly and specifically engulf and kill cancer cells. Here we
propose to test this approach against the most prevalent solid tumors like breast, lung, and
colon, and against hard-to-treat cancers like ovarian, pancreatic, and glioblastoma. Another
huge limitation of cellular immunotherapies is their cost and complexity. We propose to
overcome this problem by greatly simplifying the production and delivery of CAR-M. We
propose to transform CAR-M into an affordable, off-the-shelf therapy. This will enable
generalization of the approach to hard-to-treat diseases beyond cancer, such as multidrug
resistant bacteria, viral and fungal infections, autoimmune diseases, and more.",<Amyloid (Aβ) plaques><Amyloid Plaques><Antigen Targeting><Autoimmune><Autoimmune Diseases><Bacterial Infections><Breast><Breathing><CAR T cells><CAR modified T cells><CAR-T><CAR-Ts><Cancer Patient><Cancer Treatment><Cancers><Cell Body><Cell Therapy><Cells><Cellular biology><Cellular immunotherapy><Colon><Complex><Consumption><Democracy><Developmental Biology><Disease><Disorder><Drosophila><Drosophila genus><Early-Stage Clinical Trials><Engineering><Exclusion><Fungus Diseases><Glioblastoma><Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm><Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor><Grade IV Astrocytoma><Human><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Macrophage><Malignant Cell><Malignant Neoplasm Therapy><Malignant Neoplasm Treatment><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug Resistance><Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug Resistant><Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance><Murine><Mus><Mycoses><Mφ><Neuritic Plaques><Normal Tissue><Normal tissue morphology><Ovarian><Pancreas><Pancreatic><Phase 1 Clinical Trials><Phase I Clinical Trials><Production><Reaction><Resistance to Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug><Resistant to Multiple Anti-bacterial Drug><Respiratory Aspiration><Respiratory Inspiration><Senile Plaques><Solid Neoplasm><Solid Tumor><T cells for CAR><T-Cells><T-Lymphocyte><Testing><Time><Tumor Cell><Viral Diseases><Virus Diseases><amyloid beta plaque><amyloid-b plaque><anti-cancer immunotherapy><anti-cancer therapy><anticancer immunotherapy><autoimmune condition><autoimmune disorder><autoimmunity disease><aβ plaques><bacteria infection><bacterial disease><cancer cell><cancer drug resistance><cancer immunotherapy><cancer microenvironment><cancer therapy><cancer-directed therapy><cell biology><cell mediated therapies><cell-based immunotherapy><cell-based therapeutic><cell-based therapy><cellular therapeutic><cellular therapy><chimeric antigen T cell receptor><chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells><chimeric antigen receptor T cells><chimeric antigen receptor fusion protein T-cells><chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells><cored plaque><cost><cytokine release syndrome><cytokine storm><diffuse plaque><drug resistant microbes><drug resistant microorganism><drug-resistant microbes><exhaust><fruit fly><fungal infection><fungus infection><glioblastoma multiforme><immune cell therapy><immune-based cancer therapies><immunotherapy for cancer><immunotherapy of cancer><improved><inspiration><malignancy><multi-drug resistant bacteria><multidrug resistant bacteria><neoplasm/cancer><neoplastic cell><phase I protocol><pulmonary><resistance to cancer drugs><resistant to cancer drugs><spongioblastoma multiforme><thymus derived lymphocyte><tumor microenvironment><viral infection><virus infection><virus-induced disease>,Antimicrobial Resistance; Biotechnology; Brain Cancer; Brain Disorders; Cancer; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Immunotherapy; Infectious Diseases; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases
An Innovative Immune Therapy Targeting the TREM1-Inflammation Pathway to Alleviate Excess Inflammation in Ulcerative Colitis of Geriatric Patients,An Innovative Immune Therapy Targeting the TREM1-Inflammation Pathway to Alleviate Excess Inflammation in Ulcerative Colitis of Geriatric Patients,"Abstract
 One million Americans live with Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and 30% of that population is over 60. Thirty-eight
thousand new cases are diagnosed yearly, with 15% over 65. More than a quarter of UC patients are aged,
and prevalence in the over 65 is increasing at an annual rate of 2.8%. Surgery treatment is risky in geriatric
patients, and better therapy is needed. UC is an immune-mediated disorder of the colon that is debilitating and
not medically curable. Extensive studies have shown a pathogenesis due to aberrant immune responses to the
intestinal microbiota, resulting in acute and chronic inflammations characterized by infiltrates of activated
macrophages (MΦ), neutrophils (Ns), and lymphocytes, indicating a deregulated activation of the intestine-
innate immunity responder cells (MΦ and Ns). In UC, correlating with this deregulation is the unusual
expression of the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells-1 (TREM1) on the intestinal MΦ and the
presence of activated platelets expressing a ligand for TREM1. TREM1 is a potent activation receptor of MΦ
and Ns, and its excess triggering leads to the overproduction of inflammatory mediators and excess
inflammation. Two-thirds of patients obtain only partial or no benefit from current therapies, specifically those
with MΦ high-TREM1 expression sustained inflammation. Over 1400 scientific articles document the role of the
TREM1-activation pathway (TAP) in inflammation. We have identified TREM1-sv, a natural splice variant and
competitive inhibitor of TREM1, which can downregulate TAP. TREM1-sv was very efficient at downregulating
excess inflammation in preclinical sepsis trials, a disease driven by a deregulated TAP. In UC, deregulation of
TAP might occur from depletion of TREM1-sv, ensuing persistent activation of myeloid cells from activated
platelets. We anticipate that administering TREM1-sv intravenously or subcutaneously will stop the excess
inflammation. The rationale is that TREM1-sv downregulates TAP by competing for the TREM1 ligands,
thereby reducing the number of TREM1-ligand complexes and avoiding an excess triggering activation of MΦ
and Ns. Hence, the intestine can recover a healthy immunity and heal. We aim to show therapeutic efficacy by
conducting experiments in which different regimens of TREM1-sv are administered to well-established mouse
models of chronic ulcerative colitis with altered innate immunity. We use a custom-made strain of P. pastoris to
produce a batch of purified biologically active human recombinant (hu r) TREM1-sv for animal treatments. After
induction of UC, inflammation will be assessed before and after hu rTREM1-sv treatment with an established
four-parameter UC scoring system and correlated with measurements in the blood of the inflammatory cytokine
levels and TREM1-sv concentration. Neutralization experiments with an anti-TREM1-sv antibody and
comparative anti-TNF therapy will be conducted. We aim to produce innovative data demonstrating the benefit
of hu rTREM1-sv to downregulate hyperactive intestinal inflammation in UC. Downregulating TAP with hu
rTREM1-sv is an innovative scientific approach to alleviate excess inflammation in UC patients.",<(TNF)-α><Acute><Affect><American><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Animals><Anti-Tumor

Restoring Tolerance in Inflammatory Bowel Disease with an Oral AMPK agonist Nanomedicine that Targets Antigen Presenting Cells.,Restoring Tolerance in Inflammatory Bowel Disease with an Oral AMPK agonist Nanomedicine that Targets Antigen Presenting Cells.,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the United States alone, approximately 3.1 million adult patients suffer from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
a group of disorders characterized by chronic or recurring inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Although
several therapeutics, including anti-TNF antibodies, have been approved for the treatment of IBD, many patients
do not respond to current treatments or experience relapse, highlighting an urgent need for the development of
more effective long-term therapies.
Antigen presenting cell (APC) dysfunction drives IBD initiation by encouraging a breakdown in intestinal
homeostasis and promoting pathogenic proinflammatory circuits against harmless commensal microbes.
Although APCs are considered critical to IBD pathogenesis, there have been no APC-targeted therapies
developed to date for the treatment of IBD. Qrono Inc is developing QR401, a first-in-class, oral, APC-specific
AMPK pathway agonist for the treatment of IBD. QR401 uses custom nanoparticles to directly promote an AMPK-
induced immunoregulatory APC phenotype. This work is inspired by studies demonstrating 1) that the AMPK
pathway is downregulated by intestinal APCs in IBD patients and 2) that activation of the AMPK pathway via oral
or systemic administration of AMPK pathway agonists can successfully alleviate disease severity in preclinical
mouse studies. While AMPK has long been a target of interest for IBD, clinical development of AMPK agonists
has been limited by severe adverse effects associated with systemic administration including metabolic
complications (i.e. lactic acidosis) and cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, approaches like the one we propose that can
target AMPK agonists specifically to intestinal APCs are vital to safely activating the AMPK pathway that’s
dampened in IBD and restoring tolerance. Our preliminary data identify the AMPK agonist PF-739 as having
tolerogenic activity, marked by a dampening of pro-inflammatory IL-12p70 production coupled with a significant
increase in anti-inflammatory IL-10 secretion in LPS stimulated dendritic cells (DCs), features that promote Treg
induction. We hypothesize that targeting AMPK-activating compounds to APCs will decrease intestinal
inflammation during experimental colitis and human IBD without the metabolic and cardiac risks
historically associated with untargeted AMPK agonists. Accordingly, we will prepare and characterize
enteric-coated nanoparticles of PF-739 (QR401) that can be used for the proposed in vivo studies.
Successful completion of this project will establish proof-of-concept for a first-in-class APC-targeted
immunotherapy for IBD. A future Phase II STTR proposal would continue development in IND-enabling studies.
Qrono is committed to developing oral tolerogenic therapies for IBD, and these data will help us raise private
investment necessary for future clinical trials.",<(TNF)-α><(hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH)) kinase><21+ years old><5'-AMP-activated protein kinase><AMP-activated kinase><AMP-activated

Blood-based Alzheimer's biomarker detection at the point of care,Blood-based Alzheimer's biomarker detection at the point of care,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that leads to cognitive decline and
dementia. The disease imposes emotional and financial burdens on patients and their families, with over 5.8
million adults in the US alone affected by AD. The number of cases is expected to double by 2050, with
estimated costs exceeding $1 trillion. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective management and prevention of AD,
but current diagnostic methods like neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis have limitations in terms of
cost, availability, and invasiveness. Blood-based biomarkers offer a promising alternative for accessible and
repeated measurements.
Recent advancements in blood-based biomarkers, including amyloid-beta (Aβ), phosphorylated tau (pTau),
and Neurofilament Light chain (NfL), show potential in diagnosing and tracking AD. Plasma Aβ levels can
detect abnormalities before the onset of dementia symptoms, while elevated concentrations of specific pTau
isoforms are strongly associated with clinically diagnosed AD. NfL serves as a broad indicator of
neurodegeneration. These biomarkers align with findings from CSF and PET methodologies, presenting
opportunities for transforming AD diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring.
Despite the FDA approval of immunoassays for amyloid plaques and pTau, there is a significant lack of
commercially available point-of-care (POC) blood tests for AD. Existing blood-based AD tests are lab-specific,
bulky, expensive, and require specialized equipment. The EU/US Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease
(CTAD) Task Force emphasizes the urgent need for user-friendly, accurate, and accessible tests, particularly
in primary care settings. Implementing POC testing alongside cognitive assessment could reduce specialist
visits, shorten wait times, and generate significant cost savings for healthcare systems.
To address these challenges, we propose to develop a smartphone-based POC diagnostic system. The
system utilizes microfluidics, nanotechnology, optical sensing, and deep learning to detect AD-related
biomarkers (Aβ42, Aβ40, pTau181, pTau217, pTau231, and ΝfL) in blood-plasma within 30 minutes. The goal
is to create an affordable (<$5 material costs), disposable, and mass-producible microfluidic cartridge that
enables rapid and sensitive (LoD<10pg/mL) detection using platinum nanoparticles to generate visible optical
signal (bubbles). This innovation has the potential to fill the gap in AD management by providing an accessible
and cost-effective tool for comprehensive blood-based biomarker testing, improving screening, monitoring, and
treatment efficacy for individuals affected by AD.","<1,2,3-Propanetriol><1,2,3-Trihydroxypropane><21+ years old><A β-42><A β42><A-beta 42><A-beta42><AD dementia><AD detection><AD prevention><AI

Immunomodulatory effects of desmoglein 3 chimeric autoantibody receptor T cells (DSG3-CAART) in mucosal pemphigus vulgaris,Immunomodulatory effects of desmoglein 3 chimeric autoantibody receptor T cells (DSG3-CAART) in mucosal pemphigus vulgaris,"Project summary:
 Chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cells have transformed the cancer therapy paradigm by genetically
engineering a patient's own T cells to specifically kill cells expressing the targeted antigen, such as CD19 for B
cell malignancies. CART cell proliferation and formation of memory CART cells result in complete B cell
depletion and durable remission of otherwise refractory B cell cancers. We re-designed CART technology for
autoimmune disease therapy by utilizing an autoantigen as the extracellular domain of a chimeric autoantibody
receptor (CAAR), linked to cytoplasmic T cell receptor costimulatory and activation domains. CAARs direct T
cell cytotoxicity against autoantigen-specific B cells by targeting their B cell receptor, a surface-bound
autoantibody identical in specificity to the autoantibody the B cell will secrete once activated to mature into a
plasmablast. We established proof-of-concept for CAAR safety and efficacy in experimental models of
pemphigus vulgaris (PV), a potentially fatal blistering disease caused by autoantibodies to the epithelial
adhesion protein desmoglein 3 (DSG3). If CAARs for autoimmunity prove to be as effective as CARs for B cell
cancers, CAAR T cells could represent a one-time treatment leading to autoimmune disease cure.
 An open-label, dose-escalation, first-in-human phase 1 trial to determine the safety and tolerability of
DSG3 CAAR T cell therapy (DSG3-CAART) in mucosal-dominant pemphigus vulgaris has been initiated.
DSG3-CAART is the first precision cellular immunotherapy for autoimmune disease to enter clinical trials,
which presents a unique opportunity to define the immunomodulatory effects of this novel therapeutic approach
in humans. DSG3-CAART is designed to specifically eliminate DSG3-reactive memory B cells that replenish
the autoantibody-producing plasmablasts in PV. Depletion of anti-DSG3 memory B cells could remove a key
driver of DSG3-specific T cell activation, and DSG3-CAART persistence may induce changes in global T cell
subset composition and/or cytokine milieu, resulting in dual mechanisms for disease remission through both
the B and T cell compartments. The proposal will evaluate the hypothesis that DSG3-CAART will reset immune
tolerance in PV by depleting DSG3-reactive B cells and normalizing pathologic T cell subsets, potentially
leading to safe and lasting disease remission.",<Adhesions><Adoptive Transfer><Antibody titer measurement><Antigen Targeting><Apheresis><Area><Assay><Autoantibodies><Autoantibody binding><Autoantibody

Overcoming tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of immune evasion to boost systemic response to radiotherapy,Overcoming tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of immune evasion to boost systemic response to radiotherapy,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized the therapeutic landscape of patients with metastatic cancer.
However, despite remarkable outcomes in some patients, only a minority achieves complete and durable clinical
response. To overcome this, combination of radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade has gained
popularity to turn up the heat on cold tumors. While tumor irradiation can elicit an immunogenic cell death
triggering tumor antigen presentation and T-cell priming, immune checkpoint blockade can enhance the
expansion of tumor-reactive T cells which culminates with regression of distant non-irradiated metastases,
referred as “abscopal effect”. The synergy of radiotherapy and current immune checkpoint blockade has shown
to improve oncological outcomes in some patients but rates of abscopal effect remain scarce. Our long-term
goals are to develop new effective therapeutic combinations to boost abscopal response and improve clinical
outcome of patients with advanced cancers. To that end, there is a critical need to shed the light on the underlying
mechanisms of poor response to radiotherapy. Our group has generated compelling functional evidence
implicating the immune checkpoint molecule B7-H3 as a key mediator of tumor immune evasion that may act
both locally by impairing T cell-mediated cytotoxicity and systemically through release of immunomodulatory
tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (tdEVs). The overall objectives in this application are to gain a better
understanding of the role of B7-H3 In local and systemic antitumor immunity and evaluate the therapeutic
potential of targeting B7-H3 function with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In line with this, our central hypothesis
is that tumor B7-H3 acts as a “don’t touch me” signal which inhibits the cytotoxic function of CD8 T cells. We will
test this hypothesis through two aims. In Aim 1, we will dissect the mechanisms of B7-H3-induced CD8 T cell
dysfunction. To that end, we will use proximity labeling technologies and time-lapse imaging of T-cell mediated
cytotoxicity. We will also employ immunocompetent mouse models humanized for B7-H3 to evaluate the safety
and therapeutic efficacy of a newly developed B7-H3 inhibitor. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanisms of
systemic immunosuppression mediated by B7-H3+ tdEVs in response to radiotherapy using genetically
engineered mouse tumor cells and in vivo proximity-dependent biotinylation. We have assembled a multi-
disciplinary team with complementary expertise in extracellular vesicle biology, radiation oncology, tumor
immunology and proteomics to validate B7-H3 as a therapeutic target to boost abscopal response in patients
with advanced cancers treated with radiotherapy.",<Abscopal effect><Address><Advanced Cancer><Advanced Malignant Neoplasm><Antibodies><Antigen

Glycolysis and rodent models of Alzheimer's disease,Glycolysis and rodent models of Alzheimer's disease,"Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an inexorable and devastating neurodegenerative disease affecting mil-
lions of Americans. There are no therapies that could stop or reverse the progression of Alzheimer’s
disease, in part because the basic factors driving neuronal death and dysfunction are unknown. There
is a critical need to better understand the basic biology of AD in order to develop new disease-modify-
ing treatments.
A key contributing factor to AD is impaired glucose metabolism. Several observations support this con-
clusion. First, aging is a major AD risk factor that impairs brain glucose metabolism, reduces mitochon-
drial biogenesis, and decreases ATP levels. Second, neurodegeneration in AD can be directly quanti-
fied by imaging glucose metabolism via techniques such as 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron
emission tomography (PET). Third, metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes are key risk fac-
tors for AD. Fourth, interventions that improve metabolism such as exercise, calorie restriction, and
treatment for diabetes can mitigate the risk and progression of AD. Last but not least, Aerobic glycoly-
sis, which can be measured by FDG-PET and 15O-PET in vivo imaging, is compromised in patients with
Alzheimer’s disease.
Despite these data, it is unknown how glucose metabolism contributes to neurodegenerative pro-
cesses in AD. Our recent work demonstrated that we can enhance one aspect of brain glucose metab-
olism, glycolysis, via an existing drug, terazosin (TZ). This drug is an alpha-1 antagonist, but also acti-
vates the first ATP-generating step of glycolysis, phosphoglycerate kinase-1 (PGK1). In this proposal,
we will interrogate glycolysis in rodent models of AD, including tau and amyloid mouse lines, while
measuring metabolomics, cognitive function, 18F-FDG-PET, and protein aggregation. Our overall hy-
pothesis is that glycolysis critically regulates neurodegeneration in AD. Our specific aims investigate if
disrupting glycolysis affects rodent AD models and if improving glycolysis mitigates neurodegeneration
in AD. Because this is a fundamental mechanism, our work could have far-reaching impact for neuro-
degenerative diseases, and could be instrumental in inspiring novel disease-modifying therapies for
AD and related diseases.",<AD dementia><AD model><ATP-3-phospho-D-glycerate 1-phosphotransferase><Acceleration><Affect><Age Months><Aging><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer risk factor><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimer's disease model><Alzheimer's disease patient><Alzheimer's disease risk><Alzheimer's disease therapy><Alzheimer's patient><Alzheimer's therapy><Alzheimers Dementia><American><Amyloid><Amyloid Substance><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Automobile Driving><Binding><Biochemistry><Biogenesis><Biological Chemistry><Biological Markers><Biology><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Caloric Restriction><Citric Acid Cycle><Clinical Trials><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Control Groups><Data><Data Set><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Diabetes Mellitus><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Disturbance in cognition><Drugs><Dysfunction><ELISA><Encephalon><Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay><Exercise><FDG PET><Female><Functional disorder><Future><Gas Chromatography><Gene Expression><Glycolysis><Image><Immune mediated therapy><Immunoblotting><Immunohistochemistry><Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue><Immunohistochemistry Staining Method><Immunologically Directed Therapy><Immunotherapy><Impaired cognition><Impairment><Interdisciplinary Research><Interdisciplinary Study><Intermediary Metabolism><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Krebs Cycle><MR Spectroscopy><MT-bound tau><Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy><Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis><Mass Spectrometry><Mass Spectroscopy><Mass Spectrum><Mass Spectrum Analyses><Mass Spectrum Analysis><Measures><Medication><Metabolic Diseases><Metabolic Disorder><Metabolic Processes><Metabolism><Mice><Mice Mammals><Mitochondria><Molecular Interaction><Morbidity><Morbidity -

Bioactivity of CAR T cells secreting T cell engager-anitbodies in humans with glioblastoma,Bioactivity of CAR T cells secreting T cell engager-anitbodies in humans with glioblastoma,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a deadly brain tumor with limited treatment options. We have developed a promising new
treatment for GBM using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells. CAR-T cells are derived from the patient’s
own T cells and genetically modified to express a receptor that will target the cancer cells through a specific
antigen. We first developed CAR-T cells targeting epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII), a
mutated form of EGFR that is uniquely expressed in GBM. Treating patients with EGFRvIII-CAR-T cells resulted
in decreased EGFRvIII-expressing cells, while EGFR expression remained the same or increased. With
EGFRvIII-CAR-T cell treatment, there was also infiltration of T regulatory cells (Tregs), which are known to
suppress T cell function and may have limited CAR-T cell killing of tumor cells. To improve this therapy, we
engineered the EGFRvIII-CAR-T cell to secrete a T cell-engaging antibody molecule (TEAM) that binds to EGFR
and CD3 (CARv3.TEAM-E cells). The TEAM allows the CAR-T cell to target more than one antigen while also
activating other (non-CAR) T cells within the tumor, including converting Tregs to killer cells. We tested
CARv3.TEAM-E cells in vitro and in mouse xenograft models and found they safely and effectively target
EGFRvIII+EGFR+ and EGFRvIII–EGFR+ GBM. When these cells were injected into the mouse brain for direct
access to the tumor, very few escaped into the peripheral circulation, which protected normal tissues with EGFR
expression from being targeted by the TEAM. Based on these preclinical results, we are initiating a phase I
clinical trial of the CARv3.TEAM-E cells for the treatment of primary or recurrent GBM. The CARv3.TEAM-E cells
will be injected into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via an Ommaya reservoir. We will measure the safety of this
treatment by monitoring patients for adverse events related to CAR-T treatment and EGFR targeting.
Additionally, we will perform correlative studies to monitor CAR-T cell expansion, persistence, and phenotype in
the CSF and peripheral blood as well as infiltration into the tumor. We will examine the tumor for changes in
antigen expression (EGFRvIII, EGFR, etc.) with CARv3.TEAM-E cell infiltration and changes in other immune
cells that could be influencing CARv3.TEAM-E cell function, including Tregs and myeloid cells. We will correlate
these parameters with responses to treatment or toxicities that we observe in each patient. Overall, these studies
will inform us about the safety and feasibility of CARv3.TEAM-E cells for treating GBM, as well as provide insights
into future modifications that could improve the efficacy of these CAR-T cells or lessen their side effects.
CARv3.TEAM-E cells hold promise for improving the outcome of this dismal disease.",<Adverse Experience><Adverse event><After Care><After-Treatment><Aftercare><Antibodies><Antigen

Administrative Supplement: Autophagy mediated immune stimulation by reovirus in KRAS mutated colorectal cancer,Administrative Supplement: Autophagy mediated immune stimulation by reovirus in KRAS mutated colorectal cancer,"Project Summary
The impressive success of cancer immune therapy reached its limitations and failed in its efficacy with immune
deserted KRAS mutated tumors that constitute 45% of colorectal cancers. These patients have fewer
treatment options necessitating the development of effective alternate therapy. Of late reovirus, with a double-
stranded RNA genome, showed therapeutic efficacy in an oncogenic KRAS transformed colorectal tumors.
Although previously studied for its oncolytic properties reovirus is being increasingly appreciated for its immune
stimulation properties. However, its participation in immune stimulation, precisely utilizing two intimately related
immune and autophagic modulatory pathways, remains largely unexplored. Preliminary results indicate that
reovirus preferentially exploits the immune deserted mutant KRAS tumor microenvironment to successfully
support its propagation in conjunction with destruction of the tumor cells. Furthermore, reovirus induces
autophagy in KRAS mutated microenvironment. Knowledge gaps: It is crucial to understand the mechanism
adopted by reovirus to facilitate the immune enrichment of mutant KRAS driven immune deserted
microenvironment in colorectal cancer. The contribution of autophagic pathway in accentuating the process is
unclear. Understanding the control mechanism between the autophagy and immune pathways is critical.
Project hypothesis: The dual mode of action exerted by reovirus can be successfully translated to the clinic by
augmenting the induction of the autophagy pathway. We propose to study the pattern of reovirus mediated
induction of the autophagic machinery and determine how the molecular event is translated in improving the
immune stimulation characteristics in KRAS mutated colorectal Cancer. In this context we will make use of
KRAS mutant and wildtype colorectal cancer cell lines and our newly developed KPC:APC (tamoxifen-
inducible KRAS-mutated colorectal cancer) mouse models along with the well-established syngeneic mouse
model of colorectal cancer to mechanistically explore the process of crosstalk between the two pathways.
Results will improve the understanding of the dynamics of KRAS mutated immune deserted cold tumors in
facilitating reovirus to act as an immune stimulator Impact: This project will have dual impact of providing an
enriched biomedical science related research environment to the aspiring undergraduate students as well as to
directly address the clinical gap faced by the KRAS mutated colorectal cancer patients. Understanding the
mechanism of cross talk between the autophagy and immune pathways followed by research supported
recommendation of therapeutic induction of autophagy to improve immune therapy responsiveness of KRAS
mutated colorectal cancer will be of paradigm clinical implications. In this pursuit we will AIM1: Demonstrate
crosstalk between autophagy and immune pathways in reovirus treated KRAS mutant and wildtype colorectal
cancer cell lines. AIM2: Examine if autophagy induction promotes reovirus mediated immune stimulation in
KRAS mutated cold colorectal tumors in transgenic and syngeneic mouse models.",<Address><Administrative Supplement><Adopted><Autophagocytosis><C-K-RAS><Cancers><Characteristics><Clinic><Clinical><Colorectal Cancer><Colorectal Neoplasms><Colorectal Tumors><Development><Double-Stranded RNA><Environment><Event><Genome><Immune><Immune mediated therapy><Immunes><Immunologic Stimulation><Immunological Stimulation><Immunologically Directed Therapy><Immunostimulation><Immunotherapy><K-RAS2A><K-RAS2B><K-Ras><K-Ras 2A><K-Ras-2 Oncogene><KRAS><KRAS driven oncogenesis><KRAS oncogenesis><KRAS-driven tumorigenesis><KRAS-mediated tumorigenesis><KRAS2><KRAS2 gene><Ki-RAS><Knowledge><Large Bowel Tumor><Large Intestine Neoplasm><Large Intestine Tumor><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Mediating><Molecular><Mutate><Oncogene K-Ras><Oncolytic><Pathway interactions><Patients><Pattern><Process><Property><RASK2><Recommendation><Reovirus><Research><Research Support><Respiratory Enteric Orphan Viruses><Science><Tamoxifen><Therapeutic><Transgenic Organisms><Translating><Treatment Efficacy><Tumor Cell><autophagy><cancer microenvironment><colon cancer cell line><colon cancer patients><colorectal cancer cell line><colorectal cancer patients><colorectal neoplasia><developmental><dsRNA><immune therapeutic approach><immune therapeutic interventions><immune therapeutic regimens><immune therapeutic strategy><immune therapy><immune-based therapies><immune-based treatments><immuno therapy><improved><insight><intervention efficacy><large bowel neoplasm><malignancy><mouse model><murine model><mutant><neoplasm/cancer><neoplastic cell><oncogenic KRAS><pathway><success><therapeutic efficacy><therapy efficacy><transgenic><tumor><tumor microenvironment><undergrad><undergraduate><undergraduate student><v-Ki-RAS2 Kirsten Rat Sarcoma 2 Viral Oncogene Homolog>,Cancer; Colorectal Cancer; Digestive Diseases; Immunization; Immunotherapy
NP855 for Targeting Thyrointegrin αvβ3 receptors and Norepinephrine Transporter in Neuroblastoma Management,NP855 for Targeting Thyrointegrin αvβ3 receptors and Norepinephrine Transporter in Neuroblastoma Management,"SUMMARY: Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common cancer diagnosed in children younger than one year old
and is the most frequent solid tumor in children < 5 years of age. Those with high-risk disease have only a 40-
50% survival rate. For locally advanced and metastatic disease, high-dose chemotherapy is the primary modality
of treatment. Irradiation of the primary tumor bed is commonly undertaken after surgery for those with the MYC
proto-oncogene family that encodes basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor N (MYCN) amplified tumors,
correlated with high-risk cancers and poor prognosis. Despite the introduction of immunotherapies, the five-year
survival remains below 50%. NanoPharmaceuticals LLC is developing a novel dual targeting ligand for the
treatment of high-risk NB through a combination of a plasma membrane integrin αvβ3 antagonist and uptake of
a metabolically stable norepinephrine structural analogue via high norepinephrine transporter (NET) expression
typical of NB and other neuroendocrine cancers. BG-P-TAT is our novel chemical entity containing triazole tetrac
(TAT), a derivative of L-thyroxine, and benzylguanidine (BG), covalently bound to a 1600 MW polyethylene glycol
(PEG), P1600-TAT. P1600-TAT has a substantial panel of anticancer actions (antiproliferation, pro-apoptosis, anti-
angiogenesis) mediated by its binding to integrin αvβ3, a plasma membrane protein preferentially expressed and
activated by cancer cells. BG binds to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) expressed on the surface of
neuroendocrine cells, conferring additional binding affinity and tumor specificity. Our in vivo studies of tumor cell
targeting showed that BG-P1600-TAT (NanoPharma 855: NP855) had 70-95% tumor shrinkage in two cell lines.
This Direct to Phase II SBIR will establish IND-enabling therapeutic efficacy and safety of NP855 following scaled
up manufacturing. Aim 1. Evaluation of efficacy and PK of NP855 using scaled up product. The objective
is to confirm in vitro and in vivo efficacy in NB cells and tumors following scaled up manufacturing of non-GMP
drug material. Tasks include (1.1) Production of NP855 following process transfer, analytical evaluation, lab
demo batch production, and reference standard qualification; (1.2) In vitro confirmation of integrin binding affinity
and NET engagement by measuring uptake kinetics in NB cells versus normal cell line; (1.3) In vivo evaluation
of anti-cancer efficacy (tumor growth, NP855 tumor uptake, tumor histopathology for cancer viability and anti-
angiogenic efficacy using anti-CD31 tumor immunostaining) and PK in mice. Goals: (a) Production of 500g of
drug substance for formulation of the drug product (DP) with reference standard qualification; (b) Confirmation
of efficacy findings using scaled up DP. Aim 2. Perform IND-enabling toxicology evaluations. We will conduct
non-GLP (14 days) and GLP (28 days) dose range finding and repeated dose studies in rodent (rat) and non-
rodent (minipig) as well as in vitro assessments of solubility, stability, protein binding, transporter and cytochrome
inhibition. In vivo central nervous system, respiratory, and cardiovascular assessments will be completed. Goal:
Establish safety and toxicokinetics for NP855 in two species for IND preparation.","<0-11 years old><1 year of age><1 year old><131 Iodine><5 year old><5 years of age><Abscission><Admission><Admission

"Development of a novel, RNA-interference-based therapeutic to treat prostate cancer","Development of a novel, RNA-interference-based therapeutic to treat prostate cancer","PROJECT SUMMARY
Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common cancer in men, and the second leading cause of cancer death among
men in the United States. There is a critical unmet need to develop novel, efficacious therapeutics for PC. NUAgo
Therapeutics, Inc. is developing an RNA-interference-based therapeutic for PC based on research conducted at
Northwestern University into a naturally occurring anti-cancer mechanism. This research identified a class of
short (19-22 nt long) double-stranded (ds) interfering RNA molecules (here termed “sRNAs”) that potently target
genes that are essential for cancer cell survival. These sRNAs are derived from CAG trinucleotide repeat (TNR)
sequences that are found in genes associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including huntingtin
(the cause of Huntington’s disease) and the androgen receptor (AR) gene (the cause of spinobulbar muscular
atrophy [SBMA]/Kennedy disease). Both diseases are associated with reduced cancer incidence. Evidence
indicates that CAG expansions lead to increased production of short interfering RNAs that bind to complementary
transcripts and downregulate their expression. sRNAs containing the CAG repeat (“sCAG”) are extremely toxic
to cancer cells by targeting highly expressed CUG repeat-containing genes, providing both a mechanistic
explanation for the reduced incidence of cancer in patients with certain neurodegenerative diseases and a novel
therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. PC is a particularly attractive target for this novel therapeutic
approach. The number of CAG repeats in the AR gene is inversely correlated with PC incidence, the
aggressiveness of the disease, and the risk of distant metastasis. Longer CAG repeats thus appear to have an
anti-tumor effect, suggesting susceptibility of PC cells to sCAG. The goal of this STTR project is to develop an
sCAG-based therapeutic, which will be delivered to cells using lipopolyplex (LPP) nanoparticles, to treat PC. In
Aim 1, the uptake and activity of sCAG-LPP (“NU002”) will be evaluated in mouse models of prostate cancer,
quantifying both sCAG delivery and silencing activity in PC cells in vivo. Uptake and activity of the NU002 and a
non-toxic control sRNA will be evaluated in both tumor and normal cells in four mouse models, including two
xenograft models of PC and a syngeneic PC model. Uptake will be monitored by fluorescently labeling the
sRNAs, while silencing activity will be measured using a fluorescent reporter gene that includes a corresponding
target sequence. RNA sequencing will be used to measure the expression of target genes in tumors. In Aim 2,
the anti-tumor effects of NU002 will be characterized in vivo in the same four xenograft and syngeneic models
as in Aim 1, measuring the effect on excised tumor size at 4-6 weeks post-treatment. Histological and liver
enzyme analyses will be used to examine toxicity in normal tissues, and RNA sequencing will again be performed
on tumor and normal tissue samples to quantify the expression of targeted genes. This Phase I work will provide
proof-of-concept data supporting future work that will focus on preclinical IND-enabling studies and formulation
development in preparation for a first-in-human clinical trial.","<3' Untranslated Regions><3'UTR><AR gene><After Care><After-Treatment><Aftercare><Alpha Particle Radiation><Alpha Particles><Alpha

Metabolism of cancer chemotherapeutics by the human gut microbiome,Metabolism of cancer chemotherapeutics by the human gut microbiome,"PROJECT SUMMARY – NO CHANGES FROM PARENT GRANT
Rigorous data from our lab and others indicate that the gut microbiome may an underappreciated contributor to
inter-individual variations in cancer drug efficacy and side effect profiles; however, we currently lack the
mechanistic insights and data from preclinical mouse models necessary to inform ongoing studies in cancer
patients. We selected fluoropyrimidines, including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and its prodrug capecitabine (CAP), as
an initial test case due to their critical role in colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy, increasing oral administration,
highly variable pharmacokinetics, and unexplained differences in efficacy and toxicity. We propose a series of
in vitro and mouse studies to dissect the human gut bacterial species, genes, and enzymes responsible for the
metabolism of 5-FU (Aim 1) and CAP (Aim 2), including their downstream consequences for drug
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD).
Our overarching hypothesis is that the oral bioavailability and therapeutic effects of fluoropyrimidines
are influenced by pathways for drug metabolism encoded by diverse human gut bacterial species.
In Aim 1, we will identify and characterize the primary gut bacterial taxon responsible for 5-FU inactivation
through a combination of biochemical and cell-based assays coupled to studies in gnotobiotic and xenograft
mouse models. Based on our Preliminary Results, we hypothesize that Anaerostipes is the primary gut
bacterial genus responsible for inter-individual variations in the metabolism of 5-FU.
In Aim 2, we seek to discover the bacterial enzymes responsible for the activation of CAP to 5-FU, motivated
by the surprising finding that E. coli can activate CAP leading to reduced bacterial growth at high
concentrations. We hypothesize that E. coli catalyzes a 3-step metabolic pathway that mirrors the mammalian
conversion of CAP to 5-FU.
Our results in Aim 1 will provide a valuable proof-of-principle for dissecting the conservation and redundancies
in clinically relevant microbial biotransformations, helping to move beyond studies of model gut bacteria to
identify the most translationally relevant species. Aim 2 is potentially paradigm-shifting in that it would provide
definitive evidence for CAP bioactivation outside of hepatocytes and cancer cells, creating new opportunities to
improve treatment outcomes and study the physiological role and broader impacts of this metabolic pathway.
Taken together, this research plan emphasizes the conservation of the pathways for metabolism of
therapeutics across domains of life, highlighting the need to distinguish the relative contributions of human and
microbial cells to drug disposition, efficacy, and side effect profiles. Due to our focus on drugs used as current
standard of care and naturally occurring bacterial species prevalent in the human gut microbiome, this
preclinical research program has clear translational relevance and is highly synergistic with ongoing clinical
studies of cancer patients conducted by our team and the broader microbiome field.","<5-FU><5-Fluracil><5FU><Anti-Cancer Agents><Antibiotic Agents><Antibiotic Drugs><Antibiotics><Antineoplastic Agents><Antineoplastic Drugs><Antineoplastics><Assay><Attention><Bacterial Genes><Bioassay><Bioavailability><Biochemical><Biological Assay><Biological Availability><Biological Markers><Biotransformation><Body Weight decreased><Cancer Drug><Cancer Patient><Cancer Treatment><Cancers><Cell Body><Cells><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Clinical Trials><Coupled><Data><Disease Marker><Dose><Drug Kinetics><Drug Precursors><Drug toxicity><Drug usage><Drugs><E coli><E. coli><Enzyme Gene><Enzymes><Escherichia coli><Fluoro Uracil><Fluorouracil><Fluoruracil><Fluouracil><GI microbiome><GI microbiota><Gastrointestinal microbiota><Generalized Growth><Genes><Genetics-Mutagenesis><Gnotobiotic><Gnotobiotics><Goals><Growth><Hepatic Cells><Hepatic Parenchymal Cell><Hepatocyte><Heterograft><Heterologous Transplantation><Histologic><Histologically><Human><Immune Markers><Immune mediated therapy><Immunologic Markers><Immunologically Directed Therapy><Immunotherapy><Impairment><In Vitro><Inflammatory Bowel Diseases><Inflammatory Bowel Disorder><Intermediary Metabolism><Intestinal><Intestines><Life><Liver Cells><Malignant Cell><Malignant Neoplasm Therapy><Malignant Neoplasm Treatment><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Medication><Metabolic Biotransformation><Metabolic Pathway><Metabolic Processes><Metabolism><Mice><Mice Mammals><Microbiology><Miscellaneous Antibiotic><Modern Man><Murine><Mus><Mutagenesis><Mutagenesis Molecular Biology><Nature><Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents><Operon><Oral><Oral Administration><Oral Drug Administration><PK/PD><Pathway interactions><Patients><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Pharmacokinetics><Physiologic><Physiologic Availability><Physiological><Prevalence><Pro-Drugs><Probiotics><Prodrugs><Publishing><Randomized, Controlled Trials><Research><Role><Series><Source><Streptomycin><Study models><Taxon><Testing><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Effect><Tissue Growth><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Treatment outcome><Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents><Weight Loss><Weight Reduction><Work><Xeloda><Xenograft><Xenograft Model><Xenograft procedure><Xenotransplantation><anti-cancer drug><anti-cancer therapy><bacteria in the gut><bio-markers><biologic marker><biomarker><body weight loss><bowel><cancer cell><cancer cell metabolism><cancer metabolism><cancer therapy><cancer-directed therapy><capecitabine><clinical relevance><clinically relevant><colon cancer patients><colorectal cancer patients><colorectal cancer therapy><colorectal cancer treatment><design><designing><digestive tract microbiome><drug disposition><drug efficacy><drug metabolism><drug use><drug/agent><enteric microbial community><enteric microbiome><enteric microbiota><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><fluoropyrimidine><gastrointestinal microbial flora><gastrointestinal microbiome><gut bacteria><gut commensal><gut community><gut flora><gut microbe community><gut microbial community><gut microbial composition><gut microbial consortia><gut microbiome><gut microbiota><gut microbiotic><gut microflora><gut-associated microbiome><immune therapeutic approach><immune therapeutic interventions><immune therapeutic regimens><immune therapeutic strategy><immune therapy><immune-based biomarkers><immune-based therapies><immune-based treatments><immuno therapy><immunological biomarkers><immunological markers><improved><in vivo><inflammatory disease of the intestine><inflammatory disorder of the intestine><insight><inter-individual variability><inter-individual variation><interindividual variability><interindividual variation><intestinal autoinflammation><intestinal biome><intestinal flora><intestinal microbiome><intestinal microbiota><intestinal microflora><intestinal tract microflora><intraoral drug delivery><malignancy><microbial><microbiome><mouse model><murine model><neoplasm/cancer><ontogeny><overexpress><overexpression><parent award><parent grant><parent project><pathway><pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics><pre-clinical><pre-clinical research><preclinical><preclinical research><primary end point><primary endpoint><programs><randomized control trial><response><side effect><social role><standard of care><tumor cell metabolism><tumor growth><tumor metabolism><wt-loss><xeno-transplant><xeno-transplantation><xenograft transplant model><xenotransplant model>",Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Colorectal Cancer; Complementary and Integrative Health; Digestive Diseases; Genetics; Human Genome; Microbiome
Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia: Improving outcomes through incorporation of novel targeted therapies into treatment for relapsed and newly diagnosed disease,Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia: Improving outcomes through incorporation of novel targeted therapies into treatment for relapsed and newly diagnosed disease,"O’Brien R50 Research Specialist (Clinician Scientist)
Project Summary/Abstract
While many children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are cured with frontline therapy,
for those who experience relapse, outcomes remain suboptimal. I am a pediatric oncologist
specializing in the care of children, adolescents, and young adults with high-risk and relapsed
leukemias with a research focus on clinical trials of novel therapies in both the relapsed and
frontline settings. My clinical research efforts are conducted primarily through collaborative
studies that are made possible by the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN), specifically the
Children’s Oncology Group (COG), where I am currently spearheading the pediatric
development of inotuzumab ozogamicin as the Study Chair or Co-Chair of two large COG ALL
trials, am a member of the COG Relapsed ALL Steering Committee, and am the Vice-Chair of
the APAL2020SC screening trial for molecular characterization of relapsed leukemias with
allocation to targeted clinical trials. Beginning in October 2023, I will serve as the COG ALL
Committee Vice-Chair for Precision Medicine/Relapse. My research interests include improving
our understanding of the toxicities of novel agents, identifying patients at highest risk for side
effects and devising optimal management approaches for diverse patient populations based on
clinical features, leukemia biology, and pharmacogenomic factors. In this era of multiple novel
agents with activity in ALL including bidirectional antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, chimeric
antigen receptor T-cell therapy, and targeted agents including kinase inhibitors and modulators
of apoptosis, the development of well-designed and efficient clinical trials to determine how to
incorporate these agents for different populations will be critical to moving the field of ALL
therapy forward over the next decade. Locally, I serve as the Medical Director of the
Leukemia/Lymphoma Program at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center with a focus on
pilot studies of novel agents that, if promising, can be further developed in COG. The long-term

Multimodal dendrimer theranostics targeting aggressive subtypes of prostate cancer,Multimodal dendrimer theranostics targeting aggressive subtypes of prostate cancer,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our ultimate goal is to develop a practical, theranostic platform for managing PC. Prostate cancer (PC) is the
second most common cancer and the fifth most frequent cause of cancer death among men. Despite a gradually
improving trend in outcomes, the current death rate remains unacceptably high, with metastases in 20% of
afflicted men. The American Cancer Society estimates approximately 268,490 new cases and 34,500 deaths
from PC in the United States in 2022. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression has been
associated with aggressive PC, and is present in over 90% of metastatic disease. Those features have led to
employing PSMA for PC detection with radionuclide imaging, and for therapies including antibody-drug
conjugates, targeted radiotherapeutics and immunotherapeutic approaches. Nearly 450 trials involving PSMA in
PC are registered on clinicaltrials.gov. Nevertheless, all of the current therapies show some degree of toxicity
and are not curative. We are well-positioned to develop novel therapies through application of our PSMA-
targeted theranostic agents. We have recently synthesized PSMA-targeted poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM)
dendrimers that may be used for PC-specific concurrent delivery of imaging and therapy. PAMAM dendrimers
serve as versatile delivery vehicles that can be tailored to different sizes and compositions. Here we propose
development of multimodal theranostic agents enabling: (I) highly specific PSMA targeting; (II) application of
quantitative positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) ultimately for selecting patients for
therapy; (III) incorporation of a potent antimitotic agent; and, (IV) incorporation of optimized chemical exchange
saturation transfer (CEST) moieties to enable non-invasive monitoring of PC drug delivery by the clinically
ubiquitous imaging modality, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As we have shown, CEST is sufficiently
sensitive to enable targeted imaging. When high-frequency salicylate moieties are used there, is a frequency-
specific contrast not encumbered by background signal, allowing determination of targeting efficiency. Direct
imaging of drug biodistribution provides information needed to understand and improve efficacy. The proposed
PSMA-targeted theranostic agents will be synthesized via consecutive conjugation of PAMAM dendrimer with
deferoxamine (DFO, for radiolabeling with 89Zr, enabling PET/CT and evaluation of pharmacokinetics), lysine-
urea-glutamate moieties (KEU, for PSMA targeting), and numerous 4-(3-carboxypropanamido)-2-
hydroxybenzoic acid molecules [salicylic acid (SA) derivatives for CEST contrast]. For therapeutic studies,
proposed theranostic agents will be additionally equipped with maytansine 1 (DM1) and monomethyl auristatin
e (MMAE, both routinely used of formulation of antibody-drug conjugates) via either encapsulation or
conjugation. We will use mice bearing clinically relevant human PC metastatic xenografts for pharmacokinetic
studies. Studies will be carried out using state-of-the-art multimodal PET/CT, MRI and optical imaging.","<2-Hydroxybenzoic Acid><Affinity><American Cancer Society><Amines><Antibody-drug conjugates><Antigen

Vascular-immune mechanisms of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's pathology,Vascular-immune mechanisms of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's pathology,"Cognitive decline in the aging brain is driven by overlapping neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathologies. Over 80% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients co-present with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), the vascular deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ). Though CAA and parenchymal Aβ plaques intersect at the levels of Aβ generation and clearance—and share APOE4 as their strongest risk factor—they trigger distinct disease processes: CAA develops insidiously to erode vascular structure and function, induce microbleeds, foment neuroinflammation, and complicate anti-Aβ antibody therapies. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of CAA formation, insult, and clearance in the context of Aβ plaque pathology and APOE genotype is essential to effectively target intertwined neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathways in dementia. Yet, the molecular and cellular processes underlying CAA remain incompletely understood. Single-cell genomics has provided insights into various neurological diseases—but not yet CAA because of a lack of high-quality human tissue at scale and the inability to effectively capture brain vascular cell types. Further, animal models of AD have lacked the ability to precisely control CAA formation for its mechanistic study. To address these challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise spanning vascular neuropathology, clinical imaging, single-cell genomics of the neurovascular unit, AD models, microglia, and APOE biology. We have organized 200 human postmortem brains along CAA progression from ROSMAP with rich demographic, genomic, pathologic, MRI imaging, and longitudinal cognitive data. We will profile these samples with our new brain vascular and immune cell-capturing VINE-seq and spatial genomics approaches. Further, we recently established in mouse models of AD a new paradigm where modulating microglial function is sufficient to control the timing and burden of CAA and microbleeds. We hypothesize that in the healthy aging brain, microglia consolidate soluble Aβ into dense core parenchymal plaques to prevent more damaging vascular Aβ—and this process is disrupted by APOE4 and vascular dysfunction. Thus, we expect enhancing or impairing microglial function will modulate the balance of CAA versus parenchymal Aβ plaque burden. With parallel mechanistic studies in mouse models of CAA and molecular analyses of CAA in human tissue, we will elucidate key microglial mechanisms regulating the formation of vascular CAA versus parenchymal Aβ plaques, define single-cell and spatial human brain immunovascular signatures of CAA, and reveal how brain vascular Aβ clearance mechanisms synergize with microglia to clear CAA. With hypothesis-driven functional studies and foundational human molecular datasets of CAA informing one another, our integrated studies will advance fundamental understanding of CAA to inform the development of sensitive blood biomarkers and new approaches to enhance the safety of anti-Aβ immunotherapies.","<AD dementia><AD model><AD pathology><APOE e4><APOE-ε4><APOEε4><Abeta

Cancer Center Support Grant,Cancer Center Support Grant,"PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL
The Fred Hutchinson/University of Washington Cancer Consortium (“the Consortium”) brings together more
than 600 members with research interests in basic, clinical and public health sciences related to cancer. The
goal of the Consortium is the elimination of cancer as a cause of suffering and death through more effective
prevention, diagnostics, and treatment, deriving from fundamental insights into the biology of the disease. The
extensive interdisciplinary collaboration among the partner institutions in the cancer research disciplines of
basic, clinical, and public health sciences affords new opportunities to reduce suffering and mortality from
cancer.
The Consortium was established in 2002 to build upon the complementary strengths and resources of three
partner institutions: the Fred Hutch, which has been an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center since
1976; the University of Washington, which has significant strength in cancer research, clinical care, and
teaching; and Seattle Children’s, the major pediatric academic center in the region. In 2008, the Seattle Cancer
Care Alliance, the cancer treatment center founded and equally co-owned by the three founding institutions,
was formally added to the cancer center designation.
The Consortium’s total funding base (direct dollars) is $242M, of which $117M is peer-reviewed, including
$50M from the NCI. During the last grant period, over 170 new faculty members joined the Consortium, adding
breadth and depth to our research and clinical capabilities. In the most recent year, we enrolled 1,338 patients
onto interventional treatment trials, of which more than 50% were investigator-initiated. The ratio of accruals to
newly registered patients was 28%.
The Consortium serves a catchment area of 13 counties in western Washington. This equates to the region in
which 83 percent of our patients reside. As the only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center in a five-
state region (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho), we not only seek to serve the health needs
of the catchment area through research, training, and outreach, but also to ensure high impact throughout the
larger region.
The Consortium continues to build upon historic strengths in basic cancer biology, immunology and
transplantation, pathogen associated malignancies, tumor specific translational research, computational
biology and studies of cancer etiology, prevention, and outcomes. The Consortium is well poised to continue its
exceptional level of research in these areas. The CCSG continues to have a high impact on the Consortium,
fostering new inter-institutional collaborations, strengthening the translational research platform, and
intensifying research efforts on problems of the catchment area. Partner institutions contributed nearly $1.2
billion in institutional support during the last project period, including investments in our laboratory and clinical
research infrastructure as well as in faculty recruitment and trainee support.",<0-11 years old><Alaska><Area><Biology><CCSG><Cancer Biology><Cancer Cause><Cancer Center><Cancer Center Support Grant><Cancer Detection><Cancer Etiology><Cancer Induction><Cancer Treatment><Cancers><Carcinogenesis Mechanism><Care Givers><Caregivers><Catchment Area><Cause of Death><Cessation of life><Child><Child Youth><Childhood><Children (0-21)><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Collaborations><Communities><Comprehensive Cancer Center><Computational Biology><County><Death><Development><Diagnosis><Diagnostic><Discipline><Disease><Disorder><Education and Training><Educational process of instructing><Enrollment><Ensure><Equation><Equity><Exposure to><Faculty><Faculty Recruitment><Fostering><Funding><Genomics><Goals><Grant><HSC transplantation><Health><Health Sciences><Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant><Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation><Host-Tumor Interaction><Idaho><Immunology><Immunotherapeutic agent><Individual><Institution><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Investigators><Investments><Knowledge><Laboratories><Laboratory Research><Leadership><Malignant Neoplasm Therapy><Malignant Neoplasm Treatment><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Measures><Mentors><Mission><Molecular><Montana><Outcome><Patients><Peer Review><Population Research><Population-based research><Population-level research><Postdoc><Postdoctoral Fellow><Preventative strategy><Prevention><Prevention strategy><Preventive strategy><Primary Prevention><Public Health><QOC><Quality of Care><Research><Research Associate><Research Infrastructure><Research Personnel><Research Resources><Researchers><Resources><Risk Factors><Risk Marker><Science><Secondary Prevention><Students><Teaching><Therapeutic><Training><Training and Education><Translating><Translational Research><Translational Science><Translations><Transplantation><Underrepresented Groups><Underrepresented Populations><United States><Universities><Washington><Work><Wyoming><anti-cancer research><anti-cancer therapy><base><bases><cancer care><cancer cell metabolism><cancer diagnosis><cancer metabolism><cancer progression><cancer research><cancer therapy><cancer-directed therapy><carcinogenesis><clinical care><clinical practice><computational studies><computer biology><computer studies><develop therapy><developmental><enroll><epigenomics><graduate student><hematopoietic cell transplantation><hematopoietic cellular transplantation><hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation><host neoplasm interaction><immune drugs><immune-based therapeutics><immunologic therapeutics><immunotherapeutics><immunotherapy agent><improved><insight><inter-institutional><interdisciplinary collaboration><interest><intervention development><interventional strategy><kids><malignancy><member><mortality><multidisciplinary><neoplasm progression><neoplasm/cancer><neoplastic progression><next generation><outreach><pathogen><patient profile><pediatric><post-doc><post-doctoral><post-doctoral trainee><profiles in patients><programs><recruit teachers><research associates><risk predictor><risk predictors><synthetic biology><targeted drug therapy><targeted drug treatments><targeted therapeutic><targeted therapeutic agents><targeted therapy><targeted treatment><teacher recruitment><therapy development><transdisciplinary collaboration><translation><translation research><translational investigation><transplant><treatment center><treatment development><treatment trial><tumor><tumor cell metabolism><tumor metabolism><tumor progression><under representation of groups><under represented groups><under represented people><under represented populations><underrepresentation of groups><underrepresented people><youngster>,Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Prevention

including both standard informatics and innovative analysis pipeline development. To
this work, I bring expertise in multi-omics data analysis methods through my role leading
the DNA methylation analysis in several tumor types for The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA). In my role as bioinformatics manager of ECGC, I oversee day-to-day
bioinformatics services and supports the bioinformatics needs of investigators in areas
of data integration, annotation, high-throughput and spatial data analysis. In this
capacity, I develop bioinformatics software tools to support many cancer research
activities. I collaborate with a number of investigators across different research
programs in the cancer center. I highlight the key collaborations in this application as
illustrative of my research portfolio. For example, I played a key role in development of
the comprehensive analysis of T-cell receptor sequencing data for the FEST (Functional

Senescent CAFs in Breast Cancer Progression,Senescent CAFs in Breast Cancer Progression,"Cancer predominantly affects the elderly, with a significant incidence of breast cancer in women aged 50-70.
While cell mutations contribute to tumorigenesis, age-related changes in the tumor microenvironment,
particularly in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which themselves are diverse subsets with distinct roles,
including inflammatory, vascular, and myofibroblast CAFs (iCAF, vCAF, and myCAF, respectively)2, may play a
crucial role. Importantly, CAF subsets display substantial variability between different tissues and even within the
same tissue3. Our study identifies senescent CAFs (senCAFs) as key players in breast cancer progression. In
exciting new data we find that 1) senCAFs are frequently found in DCIS where they predict recurrence and in
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), estrogen receptor positive (ER+) BC, and Her2/Neu+ BC. 2) senCAFs are
restricted to the myCAF population, raising the possibility that they are a developmental endpoint and do not
simply appear stochastically in response to tissue level stress. 3) Depletion of senCAFs significantly reduces
primary tumor progression and metastasis. 4) senCAFs modify the biophysical features of the extracellular matrix
(ECM), which can impact host immune responses and tumor progression3. 5) senCAFs modify NK cell killing
activity, which supports tumor growth. Together, these data lead to our hypothesis that senCAFs alter the
biophysical properties of the ECM and immune responses to increase tumor growth and metastasis. To
address this exciting hypothesis, we will use state of the art immunological and biophysical techniques in novel
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) that we have built and human BC specimens in the following
Aims. 1) Determine the organ specific effects of senCAFs on metastatic BC progression; 2) Determine
how senCAFs impact ECM dynamics and tumor cell migration; and 3) Determine the impact of senCAFs
on NK cell function and BC tumor progression. Our study on senCAFs, a novel component of the breast
cancer microenvironment, may uncover critical mechanisms in breast cancer progression, guiding the
development of immunotherapeutic and senolytic strategies.",<Address><Affect><Architecture><Area><Assay><Atomic Force Microscopy><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Biophysics><Bittner Virus><Blood

Imaging of macrophage trafficking with ultrasound,Imaging of macrophage trafficking with ultrasound,"Project Summary
Imaging of macrophage trafficking can reveal important molecular, cellular, and functional characteristics of the
host tissue and support the discovery of new biomarkers for improved diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment
monitoring. Over the past years, macrophage imaging using different modalities has undergone significant
development, however existing modalities offer suboptimal tradeoffs between depth of penetration, specificity,
sensitivity, and resolution. Although ultrasound (US) could potentially address this challenge, while also providing
portable assessment (e.g., in an outpatient setting) at potentially lower costs, there is a paucity of investigations
using ultrasound for macrophage imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that labelling macrophages
with microbubble (MB) ultrasound contrast agents to augment their contrast can enable imaging of macrophage
trafficking with high sensitivity deep into tissues without compromising resolution. To test the above hypothesis,
first the detection limit of MB-labeled macrophages under different US imaging pulse sequencies will be
determined (in vitro). After identifying the minimum number of MB-labeled macrophages that can be detected in
vitro, the sensitivity of imaging MB labeled macrophages with US in healthy mice (in vivo) will be assessed next.
Finally, as a proof of concept, the ability to monitor macrophage trafficking to diseased organ and to facilitate
diagnosis will be assessed in the context of solid tumors (in tumors). If successful, the proposed research will
provide a novel framework for macrophage imaging and tracking using ultrasound to support the discovery and
clinical translation of new US methods and technology for macrophage-based diagnostics and therapy
monitoring.","<4T1><Address><Animals><Atherosclerosis><Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease><Autoimmune><Autoregulation><BALB C Mouse><BALB/c><Biological Markers><Blood monocyte><Body Tissues><Bone Marrow><Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System><Breast Cancer><Breast Neoplasms><Breast Tumors><Brittle Diabetes Mellitus><Cancer Detection><Cancers><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Count><Cell Line><Cell Number><Cell Signaling><CellLine><Cells><Characteristics><Collagen><Data><Definity><Detection><Development><Diagnosis><Diagnostic><Disease><Disorder><Echography><Echotomography><Flow Cytofluorometries><Flow Cytofluorometry><Flow Cytometry><Flow Microfluorimetry><Flow Microfluorometry><Homeostasis><Homing><Host Defense><Hour><IDDM><Image><Immune><Immunes><Immunofluorescence><Immunofluorescence Immunologic><In Vitro><Inbred BALB C Mice><Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigation><Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus><Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus><Label><Liver><MR Imaging><MR Tomography><MRI><MRIs><Macrophage><Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Malignant Breast Neoplasm><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Mammary Cancer><Mammary Neoplasms><Marrow monocyte><Measures><Mechanics><Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance><Medical Ultrasound><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Microbubbles><Microbubbles Ultrasound Contrast Agents><Microbubbles Ultrasound Contrast Medium><Microscopy><Modality><Modeling><Molecular><Monitor><Mouse Strains><Murine><Mus><Mφ><NMR Imaging><NMR Tomography><Noise><Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Optics><Organ><Out-patients><Outpatients><PET><PET Scan><PET imaging><PETSCAN><PETT><Pattern><Penetration><Performance><Physiologic pulse><Physiological Homeostasis><Play><Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging><Positron Emission Tomography Scan><Positron-Emission Tomography><Prognosis><Prognostic Marker><Pulse><Rad.-PET><Research><Resolution><Rodent><Rodentia><Rodents Mammals><Role><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Site><Solid Neoplasm><Solid Tumor><Specificity><Strains Cell Lines><Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus><T1 DM><T1 diabetes><T1D><T1DM><Technology><Testing><Therapeutic Intervention><Time><Tissues><Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus><Type 1 diabetes><Type I Diabetes Mellitus><Ultrasonic Imaging><Ultrasonogram><Ultrasonography><Ultrasound Diagnosis><Ultrasound Medical Imaging><Ultrasound Test><Zeugmatography><anti-cancer immunotherapy><anticancer immunotherapy><atheromatosis><atherosclerotic disease><atherosclerotic vascular disease><bio-markers><biologic marker><biological signal transduction><biomarker><cancer immunotherapy><clinical translation><clinically translatable><contrast imaging><cost><cultured cell line><density><detection limit><developmental><diagnostic ultrasound><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><flow cytophotometry><hepatic body system><hepatic organ system><human disease><image-based method><imaging><imaging method><imaging modality><immune-based cancer therapies><immunotherapy for cancer><immunotherapy of cancer><improved><in vivo><indexing><insulin dependent diabetes><insulin dependent type 1><intervention therapy><juvenile diabetes><juvenile diabetes mellitus><ketosis prone diabetes><malignancy><malignant breast tumor><mammary tumor><mechanic><mechanical><migration><monocyte><mouse model><murine model><neoplasm/cancer><novel><optical><pathogen><portability><positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging><positron emission tomographic imaging><positron emitting tomography><prevent><preventing><prognostic><prognostic biomarker><resolutions><social role><sonogram><sonography><sound measurement><trafficking><tumor><type I diabetes><type one diabetes><ultrasound><ultrasound imaging><ultrasound scanning>",Biomedical Imaging; Breast Cancer; Cancer; Women's Health Research
Advancing Next Generation CAR-T cells for Renal Cell Carcinoma,Advancing Next Generation CAR-T cells for Renal Cell Carcinoma,"Project Summary/Abstract
Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) accounts for approximately 90% of kidney cancers in adults. Despite the
advancements made in cytokine, immune checkpoint, and targeted therapies, the rate of complete remission is
low and nearly all patients with metastatic disease experience disease progression. CAR-T therapy showed
clinically curative outcomes in hematological malignancies. However, there are multiple roadblocks for CAR-T
efficacy in solid tumors. Our company and founder have developed novel unbiased large/whole-genome T cell
CRISPR screening approaches and identified several universal modifications that enhanced CAR-T efficacy
against several tumor models in mice. We have developed a novel unbiased loss-of-function (LOF) screen,
enabled by site-specific, high-throughput massive knock-in engineering platform. Through this unbiased
evolution platform, we have identified a key gene PRDM1 mutation (exon 3 deletion) that modifies the epigenetic
state of T cells and significantly enhances immune characteristics of CAR-T cells, including increased T cell
proliferation, reduced exhaustion with improved memory and persistence, and high intra-tumor infiltration. In
addition, we have exploited the endocytic feature of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4)
cytoplasmic tail (CT) to reprogram CAR-T function and substantially enhance CAR-T anti-tumor activity in vivo.
CAR-T cells with CTLA-4 CT fused to the CAR C-terminus exhibit a progressive increase in cytotoxicity under
repeated stimulation, accompanied by reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines.
ENPP3 is highly expressed in >90% RCC cases, and expression is highly restricted in normal tissues and
typically located apically in normal tissues and thus relatively inaccessible to CAR-T. We have generated and
screened multiple scFvs against ENPP3, developed ENPP3 gene-enhanced CAR-Ts, and showed promising in
vitro and in vivo results in our kidney cancer animal model with no toxicity.
The goal of this proposal is to evaluate whether the combination of CAR-CTLA4 tail fusion and PRDM1-exon 3
knockout (KO) results in superior CAR-T–activity against RCC tumor relative to either modification alone, and to
nominate the best performing ENPP3 CAR-T plus genetic modification(s) for IND and Phase 1 clinical trials.
Specifically, we will evaluate ENPP3 CAR-Ts with PRDM1 △exon3 alone (CIB-101), CTLA4 tail fusion alone
(CIB-102), both PRDM1 △exon3 + CTLA4 tail fusion (CIB-103), and CAR-T with no modifications (CIB-100). We
will select our final clinical candidate by performing side-by-side in vitro as well as pre-clinical in vivo evaluation
of CIB-100 to 103 (aim 1, phase1), followed by process development, GMP manufacturing, pre-clinical
development, and IND filing. These studies include efficacy, PK/PD, GLP toxicology, and pathology analysis on
our final autologous ENPP3 CAR-T clinical candidate (aim 2, phase 2). By the end of the study period, we
anticipate having selected our final ENPP3 CAR-T and genetic modification(s), performed IND-enabling studies
and GMP manufacturing, and being ready for the first Phase I clinical trial of our superior lead autologous CAR-
T products in patients with advanced RCC.

Comprehensive Cancer Center Support Grant,Comprehensive Cancer Center Support Grant,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Approximately 1.2 million people are currently living with HIV (PLWH) in the United States. These individuals
are at an elevated risk for various cancers, particularly B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (BCLs), such as diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma. These lymphomas often display comorbidity with Epstein-Barr
virus infection (EBV). The use of combinatorial antiretroviral therapy (cART) has been shown to effectively control
HIV replication, leading to restored immune function and decreased cancer rates in PLWH. Moreover, the latest
developments in cancer treatment, along with cART, have significantly increased the success rates for PLWH
battling cancer. Despite such advancements in treatment and improved survival rates, effectively managing
cancers in PLWH demands a comprehensive approach – one that takes into consideration the specific traits of
these malignancies when in the presence of HIV.
 HIV and EBV, which solely infect human hosts, create a unique obstacle in the development of in vivo models
for assessing potential cancer therapies. Humanized mice with a functional human blood system offer a valuable
model for studying immunotherapeutic approaches for BCLs under HIV and EBV co-infection. Through our
recent single-cell transcriptomics analysis of humanized mice, we have discovered that the NSG-SGM3 mouse
outperforms the standard NSG mouse in its ability to mimic various types of human blood cells found in human
peripheral blood. Developing a murine model with a realistic human tumor microenvironment largely relies on
this critical factor. This model is integral in evaluating the effectiveness of immune-based cancer therapies and
monitoring immunological changes throughout treatment. The proposed study aims to confirm the effectiveness
of new CAR-T cell approaches for treating BCLs in the presence of HIV while examining its immunological impact
using a humanized NSG-SGM3 mouse model.",<AIDS><AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Aging><Animals><Antigens><B blood cells><B cell><B cells><B lymphoma><B-Cell Activation><B-Cell Lymphomas><B-Cell NHL><B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma><B-Cell NonHodgkins Lymphoma><B-Cells><B-Lymphocytes><B-cell><Bioluminescence><Blood><Blood Cells><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Body Tissues><Burkitt Lymphoma><Burkitt Tumor><Burkitt's Lymphoma/Leukemia><Burkitt's Type Small Non-Cleaved Cell Lymphoma><C-jun Amino-Terminal Kinase><C-jun Kinase-1><C-jun N-Terminal Kinase 1><CAR T cell therapy><CAR T cells><CAR T therapy><CAR modified T cells><CAR-T><CAR-Ts><CCSG><CD4 Cells><CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes><CD4 T cells><CD4 helper T cell><CD4 lymphocyte><CD4+ T-Lymphocyte><CD4-Positive Lymphocytes><Cancer Center Support Grant><Cancer Control><Cancer Control Science><Cancer Induction><Cancer Treatment><Cancers><Cell Body><Cell Function><Cell Growth and Maintenance><Cell Maintenance><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Survival><Cell Viability><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Immune Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Characteristics><Chronic><Clinical><Comprehensive Cancer Center><DLBCL><Development><Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma><EBV Infections><Effectiveness><Engineering><Epstein-Barr Virus Infections><Epstein-Barr viral infections><Evaluation><Exhibits><Face><General Population><General Public><Generalized Growth><Genes><Germinoblastic Sarcoma><Germinoblastoma><Growth><HIV><HIV Infections><HTLV-III Infections><HTLV-III-LAV Infections><Heterograft><Heterologous Transplantation><Human><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections><Immune Monitoring><Immune mediated therapy><Immune response><Immune system><Immunochemical Immunologic><Immunologic><Immunologic Monitoring><Immunological><Immunological Monitoring><Immunological response><Immunologically><Immunologically Directed Therapy><Immunologics><Immunomonitoring><Immunotherapeutic agent><Immunotherapy><Impairment><Individual><Infection><Infusion><Infusion procedures><JN Kinase><JNK><JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases><JNK1><JNK1 Kinase><JNK1 protein><JNK1A2><JNK21B1/2><Kinases><LAV-HTLV-III><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Lymphoma><MAP Kinase 8><MAP Kinase 8 Gene><MAPK8><MAPK8 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase><MAPK8 gene><Maintenance><Malignant Lymphoma><Malignant Neoplasm Therapy><Malignant Neoplasm Treatment><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Mediating><Mice><Mice Mammals><Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8><Modeling><Modern Man><Monitor><Morbidity><Morbidity -

MICRORNA REGULATION OF ADIPOSE TISSUE IMMUNE RESPONSE IN OBESITY,MICRORNA REGULATION OF ADIPOSE TISSUE IMMUNE RESPONSE IN OBESITY,"Project Summary
Obesity cultivates complex immune responses in white adipose tissue (WAT), which may contribute to the
development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, there still exists a gap in
knowledge on cellular mechanisms regulating “obesity-specific” immune responses that precludes the
development of novel immune therapies to treat obesity and related insulin resistance and T2DM. We were one
of the first to report T cells in WAT in obesity. Further studies from us and others showed that WAT conventional
T cells promote, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) protect against, insulin resistance in obesity. Nonetheless, the
mechanisms underlying WAT Treg homeostasis and mediating their metabolic benefits remain incompletely
understood. This application aims to investigate microRNA-30a (miR-30a) regulation of WAT Tregs and its
impacts on WAT immune response and metabolism in obesity. This proposal builds on our novel pilot data: 1)
miR-30a expression in WAT correlated positively with insulin sensitivity in obese mice and people; 2) enforced
miR-30a expression in WAT promoted whole-body insulin sensitivity in obese mice; 3) miR-30a levels were high
in WAT Tregs in lean but reduced in obese mice; 4) enforced miR-30a expression in WAT of obese mice
increased WAT Treg numbers; 5) specific overexpression of miR-30a in Tregs increased WAT Treg numbers
and improved insulin sensitivity in mice fed high-fat diet. Therefore, we hypothesize that miR-30a in WAT
stimulates expansion of WAT Tregs and improves Treg functions to increase insulin sensitivity. We will
test this hypothesis by pursuing three aims: Aim 1 will define effects of cell (Treg vs adipocyte)-restricted miR-
30a on WAT immune response and metabolism in obesity and establish cell-specific roles of miR-30a; Aim 2
will build on our additional pilot data that miR-30a delivery in WAT suppresses STAT1 (a key inflammatory
transcription factor) and establish how miR-30a targeting of Stat1 governs WAT Treg homeostasis in obesity;
Aim 3 will build on our novel data that compared to diet high in saturated fat, diet high in unsaturated fat induces
higher levels of WAT miR-30a and Tregs in mice and examine dietary regulation of miR-30a and its role in WAT
immune response and metabolism. We will accomplish these aims using gain-of-function and loss-of-function
approaches in genetically modified animal models, cutting-edge immunophenotyping and transcriptomics, gold
standard clamp for insulin sensitivity, and other state-of-the-art tools. Upon completing these aims, we expect to

Determine the Role of Histone Methyltransferase ASH1L in Metastatic Prostate Cancer,Determine the Role of Histone Methyltransferase ASH1L in Metastatic Prostate Cancer,"Metastasis is the major cause of cancer mortality. Effective therapies are urgently needed for patients with
metastatic diseases. Increasing evidence suggests that interactions between cancer cells and tumor immune
microenvironment drive metastatic progression. Although prior studies established the vital roles of
immunosuppressive TME in metastatic progression, the epigenetic determinant in shaping the metastatic niche
remains understudied. Absent, small or homeotic 1-like (ASH1L) is a histone lysine methyltransferase that
induces methylations at H3K36 and . Although ASH1L was found to drive
leukemogenesis, little is known about its biological function in solid tumors and metastatic disease. Our
preliminary studies showed that ASH1L is genetically amplified and overexpressed in metastatic tumors and
contributes to metastasis and immunosuppression. The goal of this application is to determine the role and
mechanisms of action of ASH1L in the metastatic niche. The central hypothesis in this application is that histone
H3K4 and activates gene transcription
methyltransferase ASH1L contributes to the immunosuppressive metastatic niche and is a potential therapeutic
target in metastatic cancers. In the proposed studies, we will 1) determine ASH1L’s role in reshaping the
metastatic niche by combining a newly developed genetically engineered mouse model and cutting-edge single-
cell transcriptomic technologies; 2) elucidate the mechanism by which ASH1L induces immunosuppressive
metastatic niche by performing epigenetic profiling, proteomic approaches, and functional studies; 3) determine
the anti-metastatic effects of genetically depleting or pharmacologically inhibiting ASH1L in combination with
checkpoint immunotherapy in preclinical models, followed by profiling their impact on immune components in
the metastatic niche. We expect to identify ASH1L as a key epigenetic determinant in priming
immunosuppressive metastatic niche and develop effective targeted therapy and combinatorial immunotherapy
for metastatic cancers. These studies are expected to have significant positive impacts, including bridging the
knowledge gap on the role and mechanisms of action of an understudied epigenetic factor ASH1L in metastatic
cancers, advancing our understanding of the crosstalk between invading cancer cells and immune components
in the metastatic niche, and offering implications in regard to the biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and rational
combinations for metastatic malignancies.

"In vivo efficacy, safety and PK/PD analysis of SYN101, a first in class, immune cell targeted TGFb therapy for cancer patients","In vivo efficacy, safety and PK/PD analysis of SYN101, a first in class, immune cell targeted TGFb therapy for cancer patients","NCI SBIR Phase II Summary
 The immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) block a single immuno-suppressive pathway in cancer patients.
However, across all cancers, less than 30% of patients respond to ICI therapies, due to additional brakes on
the immune system, which limit efficacy. The immuno-suppressive cytokine, TGF− is one of those “brakes”
that drives checkpoint resistance in multiple solid tumors such as colorectal, bladder, prostate, head and neck
cancers and melanoma. Levels of TGF− increase as the cancer becomes more aggressive, driving a worse
patient prognosis. In addition to maintaining tissue health and homeostasis, TGF− is a validated tumor
promoting cytokine with has multiple roles in cancer development, including immune suppression, increasing
angiogenesis and driving metastasis. Despite long standing interest in TGF− blockade as a cancer therapy,
clinical development has been hampered for two main reasons: 1) significant host (i.e., cardiac) toxicity and 2)
the potential to convert indolent early stage tumors into more aggressive ones. However, in preclinical studies,
blockade of the TGF− pathway only in T cells is sufficient for tumor clearance in vivo. Thus, a therapy that
eliminates TGF− signaling solely in immune cells would drive tumor clearance, while avoiding the adverse
events demonstrated by systemic TGF− therapies. With both a Phase I SBIR grant and venture funding, we
have generated SYN101, a proprietary immune cell targeted TGF- therapeutic (SYN101) that selectively
reverses TGF- mediated immune suppression, while sparing host tissue toxicity. We have demonstrated that
monotherapy SYN101 drives tumor clearance and survival in syngeneic mouse tumor models, with
corresponding immune cell activation markers in the blood and tumor microenvironment. Moreover, SYN101
does not cause cardiac toxicity at efficacious doses in vivo. In this Phase II SBIR application, we will perform
additional in vivo efficacy, safety and PK studies with our SYN101 development candidate, which will lead to
IND enabling studies. In Aim 1, we will test efficacy of human SYN101 in humanized mouse tumor models,
along with corresponding lymphocyte PD markers in the blood and tumor microenvironment. Using CyTOF
analysis, we will define the comprehensive immune response driven by SN101 in vivo, as a step towards
identifying biomarkers of TGF- target engagement in clinical trials. In Aim 2, we will test the safety and toxicity
of SYN101 in Sprague Dawley rats, the industry standard for systemic TGF- inhibitor toxicity. In addition, we
will perform PK studies, to round out the full preclinical data package. While we do not anticipate significant
toxicity from SYN101, these studies will derisk the platform, establish efficacy and safety, and support entry
into IND enabling. Virtually every advanced tumor has elevated TGF− levels, such that a safer, more
efficacious targeted TGF- therapy would be beneficial for a significant portion of cancer patients. SYN101 will
provide new therapeutic options for refractory cancer patients and will safely reverse immune suppression to
improve patient response rates.",<70 kDa zeta-associated protein><Advanced Cancer><Advanced Malignant Neoplasm><Adverse Experience><Adverse event><Animals><Antibodies><Antibody-drug

The immunosuppressive function of Checkpoint kinase 2 in gliomas,The immunosuppressive function of Checkpoint kinase 2 in gliomas,"Project Abstract
 Whereas the contribution of tumor microenvironment to the profound immune suppression of
glioblastoma (GBM) is clear, tumor-cell intrinsic mechanisms that regulate resistance to CD8 T cell mediated
killing are less studied. We performed an in vivo CRISPR screen to identify glioma intrinsic kinases that
contribute to evasion of tumor cells from CD8 T cell recognition. The screen revealed checkpoint kinase 2
(Chek2) to be the most important kinase contributing to escape from CD8 T-cell recognition. Genetic depletion
or pharmacological inhibition of Chek2 with blood-brain-barrier permeable drugs that are in the clinical trials, in
combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, led to survival benefit in preclinical glioma models. Furthermore, our
experiment using ex vivo gliomas showed that glioma tumor cell intrinsic Chek2 interacts with Y-Box Binding
Protein 1 and 3 (YBX1&3). The YBX1&3 are DNA/RNA binding proteins implicated in transcriptional regulation
of immune-modulatory genes. However, the mechanism underlying the immunosuppressive function of Chek2
in gliomas is unknown. Therefore, in this proposal, we propose to determine the Chek2-YBX1&3 interaction
mediated transcriptional changes that modulate CD8 T cell response using chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing and CD8 T cell -mediated tumor cell killing assay (Aim 1). As an independent mechanism, we will
investigate the contribution of Chek2 inhibition/depletion dependent STING pathway activation in enhancing
CD8 T cell response by inhibiting STING pathway and studying its impact on CD8 T cell proliferation using OT-
1 CD8 T cell assay (Aim 2). As a potential novel therapeutic approach, we will test if targeting YBX1 enhances
response to PD-1 blockade by determining the effect of this treatment strategy on the survival of preclinical
glioma models (Aim 3). Together, this project will elucidate the mechanism underlying the immunosuppressive
function of Chek2 and will provide a novel therapeutic strategy combining YBX1 inhibition, Chek2 inhibition and
PD-1 blockade for testing in GBM patients.",<(IFN) α><(IFN)-α><(IFN)α><Abbreviations><Address><Alferon><Antigen Presentation><Assay><BBB permeabilization><BBB permeable><Bioassay><Biological

Improved delivery of bNAbs for targeting CNS infection in infants,Improved delivery of bNAbs for targeting CNS infection in infants,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Despite the tremendous success of the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the persistence of HIV
reservoirs remains as the major obstacle to achieve HIV cure in infants. Current strategies mainly focus on the
peripheral reservoirs; however, their efficacy is limited in the central nerve system (CNS) due to its unique
anatomy. Extensive studies indicate that replication-competent reservoirs persist in the CNS under cART,
causing neurological disorders in 15-55% of HIV+ individuals on cART. This issue is particularly concerning for
infants, whose brains still grow and develop, leading to numerous neurodevelopment consequences and
neurologic diseases. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective treatment to suppress CNS infection in
infants. One promising strategy is the use of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAb) directed to HIV-1, which
have demonstrated potential in both viral suppression and reservoir clearance in animal models and clinical trials.
However, the use of bNAbs for the CNS reservoirs is confounded by poor penetration of the blood brain barrier
(BBB). Typically, antibody concentrations in the CNS are extremely low, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels at
~0.1% of those in blood. Our team has developed a novel nanotechnology, which we term nanocapsules, to
encapsulate bNAb molecules within polymer shells, of which the surface contains abundant choline analogues.
Such nanocapsules can effectively deliver bNAbs into the CNS by binding to the choline transporter on the BBB
upon systemic administration, showing promising results in suppressing the virus in the CNS of non-human
primate (NHP) infants.
 Our understanding of CNS infections and associated neuroinflammation during early infection and early
treatment is still limited. Recent advances in molecular biology, nucleotide sequencing, and bioinformatics have
enabled our team to develop methods to track infected cell clones with viral integration sites, revealing the impact
of therapy on clonally expanded virus-infected cells. We are also exploring the use of a library of barcoded
viruses for population-level analysis of infection in latent reservoirs and following HIV rebound.
 In this proposed study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of bNAbs in nanocapsules against CNS infections
and reservoirs, both with and without cART. The success of this study will shed light on the mechanisms
underlying CNS infections in infants and demonstrate the effectiveness of bNAbs with improved CNS delivery in
suppressing CNS and deep tissue infections and reservoirs. The findings could lead to interventions that can be
initiated within the first few weeks of infection, a critical period associated with reduced mortality and slower HIV
progression in infants.",<0-4 weeks old><21+ years old><AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Adult><Adult Human><After

Localizing Therapeutics to Target Lung Myofibroblasts and Reverse Fibrosis,Localizing Therapeutics to Target Lung Myofibroblasts and Reverse Fibrosis,"Project Summary/Abstract
Lung diseases are a global public health problem with significant morbidity, inadequate therapies and a very
high burden to society. Of these, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is particularly challenging to treat as existing
therapeutics, Nintedanib and Pirfenidone, only slow progression but do not reverse fibrosis. One of the reasons
is in part due to the fact that the vascular endothelium represents a key barrier to effective delivery of anti-fibrotic
drugs into lung tissue. Current systemic lung therapies rely on passive transvascular transport to move circulating
drugs from the bloodstream and into the target tissue. Hoverer, only minute fractions of the injected doses
actually reach the lung tissue, diminishing efficacy and often necessitating dose escalation. The ideal goal is to
deliver the entire dose of therapeutic into the lung with the minimal exposure of other tissues. We attempt to
approach this ideal goal by pumping unique immunotherapeutics precisely into lung tissue to comprehensively
block activation and differentiation of MF, the key driver of profibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and
activation of survival cascades, leading to progressive scarring. The goal of this project is to develop and test
novel lung precision drug delivery system (LPDDS) targeting endothelial cells caveolae that are actively and
specifically pump myofibroblasts (MF)-directed antifibrotics into lungs at microdoses after intravenous (iv)
injection. We have identified the cell surface protein Thy-1 a precision therapeutic and a major modulator of MF
activation and differentiation and characterized its role in resolving fibrosis via synergistic engagement of multiple
profibrotic signaling pathways. Based on this, we engineered the first “dual precision” bispecific therapeutic
mAPP:Thy-1 with antibody mediating precise binding/delivery to and penetration of lung tissue via caveolae
transcytosis and the other – mediating Thy-1’s fibrosis-resolving activity in the lung interstitium where the loss of
Thy-1 promotes a dysregulated MF phenotype driving fibrosis. To further potentiate antifibrotic effect, we
designed mAPP:FAP-Nintedanib immunoconjugates, where concerted action of Thy-1 and Nintedanib in the
lung parenchyma has even greater power to concentrate their fibrosis-resolving activities at the site of action,
potentially reversing fibrosis. Our goal is to explore transendothelial pumping via caveolae to improve therapy of
lung diseases at various stages from very early inflammatory to fibrotic. We will optimize lung targeting of our
LPDDS through engineering and chemistry and will study their specific lung delivery, penetration, accumulation,
and therapeutic impact using multiple imaging techniques (SPECT-CT, IVM, EM, and IHC). Therapeutic effects
will be determined in two rat models that can reproduce many pathological hallmarks of inflammatory and fibrotic
disease stages. Our specific aims are 1) to generate and test in vitro activity of caveolae- and myofibroblast-
targeting therapeutics, 2) to assess the lung targeting, imaging and tissue processing of caveolae- and
myofibroblast-targeting therapeutics in rodent models of fibrosis, and 3) to test the therapeutic efficacy of
caveolae/myofibroblast-targeting therapeutics in lung fibrosis. This work sets a foundation for caveolae-targeted
therapies and could begin a paradigm shift from passive to active delivery for many pulmonary diseases.",<Address><Antibodies><Binding><Biodistribution><Biological><Biological Agent><Biological Products><Bleo><Bleomycin><Blood Circulation><Blood Vessels><Bloodstream><Body Tissues><CAT scan><CT X Ray><CT Xray><CT imaging><CT scan><Categories><Caveolae><Caveolas><Cell Body><Cell Surface Proteins><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cells><Chemicals><Chemistry><Cicatrix><Clinical><Clinical Trials><Common Rat Strains><Computed Tomography><Deposit><Deposition><Development><Diarrhea><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Dose><Drug Delivery><Drug Delivery Systems><Drugs><ECM><ELISA><Endothelial Cells><Endothelium><Engineering><Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay><Esbriet><Exhibits><Extracellular Matrix><Failure><Fibroblasts><Fibrosing Alveolitis><Fibrosis><Fibrotic lesions in lung><Foundations><Genetic Engineering><Genetic Engineering Biotechnology><Genetic Engineering Molecular Biology><Goals><Human><Image><Imaging Procedures><Imaging Technics><Imaging Techniques><Immunoconjugates><Immunotherapeutic agent><In Vitro><Inflammatory><Interstitial Lung Diseases><Job Location><Job Place><Job Setting><Job Site><LC/MS><Length><Libraries><Link><Liver Dysfunction><Lung><Lung Diseases><Lung Parenchyma><Lung Respiratory System><Lung Tissue><Lung Tissue Fibrosis><Lung scar><Lung tissue scar><Magic><Measures><Mediating><Medication><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular Interaction><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Myofibroblast><Ofev><Oropharyngeal><Oropharynx><Oropharynxs><Pathologic><Penetration><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phenotype><Pirfenidone><Precision therapeutics><Preclinical Testing><Profibrotic factor><Profibrotic signal><Proliferating><Public Health><Pulmonary Diseases><Pulmonary Disorder><Pulmonary Fibrosis><Pulmonary Scar><Pulmonary Tissue fibrosis><Pulmonary imaging><Pump><Rat><Rats Mammals><Rattus><Recombinant DNA Technology><Rodent Model><Role><SPECT><SPECT imaging><Scarring at the lung><Scarring in the lung><Scars><Signal Pathway><Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography><Site><Slice><Societies><Structure of parenchyma of lung><Testing><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Effect><Time><Tissues><Tomodensitometry><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Treatment Efficacy><Vascular Endothelium><Work Location><Work Place><Work-Site><Workplace><Worksite><X-Ray CAT Scan><X-Ray Computed Tomography><X-Ray Computerized Tomography><Xray CAT scan><Xray Computed Tomography><Xray computerized tomography><biologic><biologics><biomarker validation><biopharmaceutical><biotherapeutic agent><catscan><computed axial tomography><computer tomography><computerized axial tomography><computerized tomography><design><designing><developmental><diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis><disease of the lung><disorder of the lung><drug/agent><efficacy testing><enzyme linked immunoassay><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><fibrosis in the lung><fibrotic lung><genetically engineered><idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis><image processing><imaging><immune drugs><immune-based therapeutics><immunologic therapeutics><immunotherapeutics><immunotherapy agent><improved><in vitro activity><in vitro testing><in vivo><interstitial><intervention efficacy><intravenous injection><lead candidate><liquid chromatography mass spectrometry><lung disorder><lung fibrosis><lung imaging><lung scanning><marker validation><mortality><mutant><nintedanib><non-contrast CT><noncontrast CT><noncontrast computed tomography><novel><oral pharyngeal><personalized drugs><phospho-proteomics><phosphoproteomics><pre-clinical testing><precision drugs><precision therapies><precision treatment><prevent><preventing><prototype><public health relevance><pulmonary><restoration><scRNA-seq><scale up><side effect><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single photon emission computed tomography><single-cell RNA sequencing><site targeted delivery><small molecule><social role><targeted delivery><targeted drug therapy><targeted drug treatments><targeted therapeutic><targeted therapeutic agents><targeted therapy><targeted treatment><therapeutic efficacy><therapeutic evaluation><therapeutic target><therapeutic testing><therapy efficacy><tissue processing><transcytosis><vascular><work setting>,Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Biotechnology; Lung; Pulmonary Fibrosis
Metabolic and molecular regulation of myeloid cell functions in brain cancer,Metabolic and molecular regulation of myeloid cell functions in brain cancer,"Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive and lethal form of brain cancer, is characterized by a profound
immunosuppressive microenvironment (TME) that restricts the effects of promising immunotherapies. Therefore,
there is a pressing need to develop more effective interventions to overcome this mechanism of resistance.
Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are a mixture of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and microglia
(MG), and they are instrumental for the maintenance of the immunosuppressive state of GBM. However, there
are no effective approaches to overcome the immunosuppressive activity of TAMs in GBM, mainly due to an
incomplete understanding of TAM regulatory functions. Our long term-goal is to dissect targetable metabolic and
molecular mechanisms regulating TAM functions in the context of GBM; as these discoveries will facilitate novel
therapies to target immunosuppression and improve the dismaying outcome of GBM patients. A recent study
demonstrated that TAM are major consumers of glucose and maintain a robust glucose metabolism in the TME.
However, it has not yet been determined how GBM supports the adaptation to glucose metabolism in TAMs
and the functional consequences of this adaptation also remain elusive. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
activation is associated with the malignant progression of glioma and with the infiltration of anti-inflammatory
macrophages. PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), a critical ER stress sensor, was found to be significantly activated
in human glioma tissues, and its inhibition altered ATP/lactate production by glioma cells. Our preliminary data
expanded these findings indicating that MDM demonstrated highest glucose avidity among MG and neoplastic
cells in GBM tumors, and PERK was strongly activated in GBM infiltrating GLUT1+MDM. Contrary to MG, MDM
exhibited potent immunosuppressive activity. GLUT1+MDM were the only contributors to the suppressive activity
associated with MDM in GBM tumors. GBM-derived factors primed activation of PERK signaling in MDM, which
correlated with metabolic reprogramming resulting in high glycolysis, immunosuppressive functions, histone
lactylation, and no change in histone acetylation. Based on our crucial observations, we hypothesize that a
PERK-driven perturbation of glucose metabolism in MDM governs their immunosuppressive functions via
lactate-derived lactylation of histone lysine residues. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:
Aim1: to elucidate underlying mechanisms of how PERK governs glycolysis in MDM in GBM tumors; Aim2:
to define glucose-driven epigenetic modifications that regulates immunosuppressive programs in MDM;
Aim3: to investigate the therapeutic potential of an epigenetic targeting approach to modulate the functions
of TAMs in GBM. The proposed studies are highly innovative because they will elucidate a previously
uncharacterized link between ER stress and glucose metabolism that regulates the activity of TAMs via
epigenetic mechanisms. Our proposal will provide a mechanistic rationale for the development of novel
therapies to target immunosuppressive TAMs and enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in GBM patients.","<Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Anti-Inflammatories><Anti-Inflammatory Agents><Anti-inflammatory><Automobile Driving><Avidity><Binding><Blood monocyte><Body Tissues><Brain Cancer><CAR T cell therapy><CAR T cells><CAR T therapy><CAR modified T cells><CAR-T><CAR-Ts><CUT&RUN><Cancers><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Cleavage Targets and Release Using Nuclease><Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease><Clinical><Clinical Trials><Consumption><D-Glucose><Data><Development><Dextrose><ER stress><Endoplasmic Reticulum><Epigenetic><Epigenetic Change><Epigenetic Mechanism><Epigenetic Process><Ergastoplasm><Erythrocyte/Hepatoma Glucose Transporter><Exhibits><Exposure to><GLUT><GLUT1><Gene Transcription><Genes><Genetic Transcription><Glial Cell Tumors><Glial Neoplasm><Glial Tumor><Glioblastoma><Glioma><Glucose><Glucose Transporter 1><Glycolysis><Goals><Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm><Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor><Grade IV Astrocytoma><Histone Acetylation><Histones><Hortega cell><Human><Hypoxia><Hypoxic><Immune><Immune mediated therapy><Immunes><Immunologically Directed Therapy><Immunosuppression><Immunosuppression Effect><Immunosuppressive Effect><Immunotherapy><In Vitro><Infiltration><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Isotopes><Kinases><L-Lysine><Label><Link><Lysine><Macrophage><Maintenance><Malignant><Malignant -

Monitoring Immunotherapy Response via Gene Silencing Landscapes in Cell-Free DNA,Monitoring Immunotherapy Response via Gene Silencing Landscapes in Cell-Free DNA,"ABSTRACT:
Immunotherapies produce remarkable, long-term responses in subsets of patients with non-small cell lung
cancer, but unfortunately, most patients do not respond to such treatment. Current biomarkers to predict which
patients will benefit have limited accuracy, and decisions to continue or suspend treatment are mainly guided by
monitoring of radiographic changes in tumor size. However, unusual immune-related response patterns such
as pseudo-progression, mixed response, and delayed response can make scans difficult to interpret. Circulating
tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a highly promising biomarker for monitoring immunotherapy efficacy.
Several studies involving various immunotherapy agents and multiple types of cancer have demonstrated that
early reduction in ctDNA levels during treatment are predictive of tumor response and improved survival
outcomes. However, existing technologies that measure ctDNA by probing for common somatic mutations will
fail in patients whose tumors lack these mutations. This limitation is being addressed by creating customized
assays based on patient-specific tumor mutation profiles; but this approach is complex, expensive, and slow.
We have developed a ctDNA assay technology based on detection of epigenetic features that are found in
virtually all cancer cell genomes. Our Phase I data indicate that our approach has broad patient coverage and
can be applied to multiple types of cancer without requiring tumor profiling and assay customization. In this
Phase II project, we aim to build data to support the clinical utility of our assay technology for monitoring of lung
cancer immunotherapy response. We also aim to advance our current research-mode assay to rigorous clinical-
grade testing standards for use in clinical practice.","<Address><Assay><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Biological Markers><Blood><Blood Plasma><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Blood Tests><Cancer Detection><Cancer Patient><Cancers><Carcinogenesis Mechanism><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Checkpoint inhibitor><Circulation><Clinical><Clinical Evaluation><Clinical Sensitivity><Clinical Testing><Clinical Trials><Complex><DNA><DNA Hybridization Probes><DNA Probes><Data><Deoxyribonucleic Acid><Detection><Epigenetic><Epigenetic Change><Epigenetic Mechanism><Epigenetic Process><Fingerprint><Foundations><Gene Expression><Gene Inactivation><Gene Silencing><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic defect><Genome><Genomic Segment><Genomics><Hematologic Tests><Hematological Tests><Hematology Testing><Hypermethylation><Immune><Immune checkpoint inhibitor><Immune infiltrates><Immune mediated therapy><Immunes><Immunologically Directed Therapy><Immunotherapeutic agent><Immunotherapy><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Kinetics><Laboratories><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Malignant Tumor of the Lung><Malignant neoplasm of lung><Marketing><Measurement><Measures><Methods><Methylation><Monitor><Mutation><NSCLC><NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer><Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer><Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma><Outcome><Paper><Patients><Pattern><Performance><Phase><Plasma><Plasma Serum><Prediction of Response to Therapy><Process><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Publishing><Pulmonary Cancer><Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm><Radiography><Reproducibility><Research><Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma><Roentgenography><Sampling><Scanning><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Somatic Mutation><Specific qualifier value><Specificity><Specified><Survey Instrument><Surveys><Technology><Testing><Therapeutic><Time><Treatment Efficacy><Tumor Tissue><Universities><Work><anti-cancer immunotherapy><anticancer immunotherapy><bio-markers><biologic marker><biological signal transduction><biomarker><cancer cell genome><cancer genome><cancer immunotherapy><cancer type><cell free DNA><cell free circulating DNA><check point immunotherapy><check point inhibitor therapy><check point inhibitory therapy><check point therapy><checkpoint immunotherapy><checkpoint inhibitor therapy><checkpoint inhibitory therapy><checkpoint therapy><chemotherapy><clinical practice><clinical predictors><clinical test><commercial application><commercialization><density><depository><detection assay><detection limit><disease control><disorder control><effective therapy><effective treatment><epigenetically><exome sequencing><exome-seq><genome mutation><genome segment><genomic region><immune cell infiltrate><immune check point inhibitor><immune check point therapy><immune checkpoint therapy><immune drugs><immune therapeutic approach><immune therapeutic interventions><immune therapeutic regimens><immune therapeutic strategy><immune therapy><immune-based cancer therapies><immune-based therapeutics><immune-based therapies><immune-based treatments><immuno therapy><immunologic therapeutics><immunotherapeutics><immunotherapy agent><immunotherapy for cancer><immunotherapy of cancer><improved><ineffective therapies><ineffective treatment><intervention efficacy><liquid biopsy><longitudinal imaging><lung cancer><malignancy><mutant><neoplasm/cancer><patient subclass><patient subcluster><patient subgroups><patient subpopulations><patient subsets><patient subtypes><predict therapeutic response><predict therapy response><promoter><promotor><radiologic imaging><radiological imaging><repository><research clinical testing><responders and non-responders><responders from non-responders><responders or non-responders><responders versus non-responders><responders vs non-responders><responders/nonresponders><response><serial imaging><side effect><somatic variant><success><survival outcome><therapeutic efficacy><therapy efficacy><therapy prediction><transcriptional silencing><treatment prediction><treatment response prediction><tumor><tumor DNA><tumor cell DNA><tumor genome><tumor-specific DNA><validation studies><virtual>",Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Human Genome; Immunotherapy; Lung; Lung Cancer; Precision Medicine
Assessment of germline variants associated with immune-related adverse events following immune checkpoint inhibitors,Assessment of germline variants associated with immune-related adverse events following immune checkpoint inhibitors,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment but come with the significant downside
of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which can lead to treatment discontinuation, hospitalization, or even
death. Understanding the mechanisms behind irAEs is imperative, not only to minimize toxicity but also because
irAEs are paradoxically linked to positive anti-tumor responses, while their aggressive management correlates
with increased relapse risk.
Our research posits that gaining a nuanced understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying irAEs could
enable clinicians to differentiate between clinical benefits and harmful side effects, thus optimizing
immunotherapy efficacy. We have previously shown that germline variants are associated with irAEs, and have
also noted that somatic alterations impact immunotherapy efficacy by interacting with the immune environment.
Short-term Objectives:
Aim 1: We plan to conduct the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) for irAEs, covering over 13,000
ICI patients, using novel imputation and survival models. This will include aggregating pan-cancer data across
multiple cohorts. We aim to characterize shared and distinct genetic architectures of irAE subtypes and evaluate
how germline variants interact with therapy agents to influence safety and efficacy outcomes. We will aggregate
germline data for 13,000 patients to conduct a GWAS for irAEs and clinically annotate and aggregate pan-cancer
data. Sub-population GWAS will identify subtype/organ-specific germline associations. Longitudinal competing
event models will be used to assess the mechanistic effects of each variant on safety and efficacy outcomes.
Aim 2: We will delve into the cell-type-specific mechanisms, tumor microenvironment interactions, and ancestral
variability of germline irAE variants. Bulk and single-cell RNA-seq (sc-RNA-seq) data will be integrated to
elucidate these mechanisms, and somatic alteration interactions will also be analyzed. RNA-seq and tumor/blood
scRNA-seq will be utilized to identify cell-type-specific mechanisms and interactions of germline variants with
somatic drivers.
Long-term Objectives: Our long-term goal is to personalize immunotherapy by tailoring it to individual genetic
makeup, thus minimizing irAEs and optimizing efficacy. This could dramatically improve cancer treatment
outcomes and reduce healthcare burdens associated with complications, contributing to public health. By
dissecting the genetic landscape and its interaction with immunological and somatic factors, our work aims to
pave the way for safer and more effective cancer immunotherapies.",<9p21><Adrenal Cortex Hormones><Allele Frequency><Antitumor Response><Asian group><Asian individual><Asian people><Asian population><Asians><Autoimmune><Autoimmune Diseases><Biological><Biological Response Modifiers><Biomodulators><Blood><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Cancer Patient><Cancer Treatment><Cancers><Cell Body><Cells><Cessation of life><Checkpoint inhibitor><Clinical><Clinical Data><Clinical Management><Clinical Trials><Corticoids><Corticosteroids><Data><Death><Development><Environment><European ancestry><Event><Exhibits><GWA study><GWAS><Gene Expression><Gene Frequency><Genetic><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic Markers><Genetic defect><Genetic study><Genomics><Germ Lines><Germ-Line Mutation><Germline Mutation><Goals><Grawitz Tumor><Hereditary Mutation><Heritability><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Hypernephroid Carcinoma><Hypernephroma><IL-7><IL-7 Gene><IL7><IL7 Protein><IL7 gene><Immune><Immune Mediators><Immune Mediators/Modulators><Immune Regulators><Immune checkpoint inhibitor><Immune mediated therapy><Immunes><Immunochemical Immunologic><Immunologic><Immunological><Immunologically><Immunologically Directed Therapy><Immunologics><Immunology><Immunotherapeutic agent><Immunotherapy><Individual><Infiltration><Interleukin 7 Precursor><Interleukin 7 Precursor Gene><Interleukin-7><Interleukin-7 Gene><Interruption><Link><Lymphopoietin-1><Malignant Melanoma><Malignant Neoplasm Therapy><Malignant Neoplasm Treatment><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Melanoma><Modeling><Mutation><Nephroid Carcinoma><Organ><Outcome><Patients><Population><Public Health><RNA Seq><RNA sequencing><RNAseq><Randomized><Renal Adenocarcinoma><Renal Cell Adenocarcinoma><Renal Cell Cancer><Renal Cell Carcinoma><Research><Resistance><Risk><Safety><Serious Adverse Event><Severe Adverse Event><Shapes><Side><Specificity><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Treatment outcome><Variant><Variation><Work><allelic frequency><anti-cancer immunotherapy><anti-cancer therapy><anti-tumor response><anticancer immunotherapy><autoimmune condition><autoimmune disorder><autoimmunity disease><biologic><cancer immunotherapy><cancer microenvironment><cancer sub-types><cancer subtypes><cancer therapy><cancer type><cancer-directed therapy><cell type><cohort><developmental><disability><efficacy outcomes><gene biomarker><gene expression biomarker><gene marker><gene signature biomarker><genetic architecture><genetic biomarker><genetic make-up><genetic makeup><genome mutation><genome wide association><genome wide association scan><genome wide association studies><genome wide association study><genomewide association scan><genomewide association studies><genomewide association study><germ-line defect><germline variant><health care quality><healthcare burden><healthcare quality><immune check point inhibitor><immune drugs><immune therapeutic approach><immune therapeutic interventions><immune therapeutic regimens><immune therapeutic strategy><immune therapy><immune-based cancer therapies><immune-based therapeutics><immune-based therapies><immune-based treatments><immune-mediated adverse events><immune-related adverse effect><immune-related adverse events><immune-related adverse reaction><immuno therapy><immunologic therapeutics><immunomodulatory biologics><immunotherapeutics><immunotherapy agent><immunotherapy for cancer><immunotherapy of cancer><improved><inhibitor drug><inhibitor therapeutic><inhibitor therapy><insight><kidney adenocarcinoma><large data sets><large datasets><malignancy><molecular scale><neoplasm/cancer><novel><personalization of treatment><personalized immunotherapy><personalized medicine><personalized therapy><personalized treatment><precision immunotherapy><randomisation><randomization><randomly assigned><relapse risk><resistant><response><safety outcomes><scRNA-seq><serious adverse experience><serious adverse reaction><side effect><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single-cell RNA sequencing><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing><treatment planning><tumor><tumor microenvironment><whole genome association analysis><whole genome association studies><whole genome association study>,Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Human Genome; Immunotherapy
H3K27M as a Target for RNA-nanoparticles in the Treatment of Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma,H3K27M as a Target for RNA-nanoparticles in the Treatment of Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma,"Diffuse Midline Glioma (DMG) is an inoperable pediatric brain tumor with no good treatment options.
Our group has developed a novel treatment modality for this disease and others, using mRNA vaccines
consisting of tumor derived antigens packed into a unique lipid nanoparticle (NP). They can provide near
immediate immune induction against inciting malignancies. RNA-NPs can thus be harnessed as an
effective therapy for patients with DIPG and other refractory malignancies. In addition, DIPG has a
highly conserved H3K27M mutation that serves as an excellent target for these therapies.
Based on the above, we propose exploring the immunogenicity of RNA-NPs targeting the DIPG
H3K27M mutation, as well as the feasibility, safety, and anti-tumor activity of tumor loaded RNA-NP
vaccines in animal models. These RNA NPs have shown survival benefit in our preclinical murine model
of DMG. Among these animals with significant survival benefit, there is development of hydrocephalus,
which is thought to be secondary to increased lesion size secondary to an immunotherapeutic response
during treatment. In our clinical trials investigating RNA NPs as a treatment for canine glioma in adult
dogs, we saw a similar effect in MRI imaging of animals that became long-term survivors. Following
detailed analysis of these lesions in mouse, canine and human patients during RNA-NP therapy, there
appears to be features of both reactive gliosis and traditional pseudoprogression (immune infiltration),
suggesting a new radiographic diagnosis I have named paraprogression. I hypothesize that
paraprogression is a novel radiographic entity characterized by reactive gliosis and increased lesion size
in therapeutic responders. In this study, I aim to visualize paraprogression using advanced MRI
techniques, elucidate the mechanism behind the increase in lesion size, and combat this effect without
compromising our promising survival benefit conferred by RNA NP vaccine in our preclinical DMG
model.","<21+ years old><Adult><Adult Human><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Animals><Antigens><Cancers><Canine Species><Canis familiaris><Childhood><Childhood Brain Neoplasm><Childhood Brain Tumor><Clinical Trials><DIPG><Development><Diagnosis><Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma><Disease><Disorder><Dogs><Dogs Mammals><Glial Cell Tumors><Glial Neoplasm><Glial Tumor><Glioma><Gliosis><H3 K27M mutant><H3 K27M mutation><H3K27M mutant><H3K27M mutation><Health><Human><Hydrocephalus><Hydrocephaly><Immune><Immune infiltrates><Immunes><Immunotherapeutic agent><Knowledge><Lesion><Life><Long-Term Survivors><MR Imaging><MR Tomography><MRI><MRIs><Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modality><Modeling><Modern Man><Murine><Mus><NMR Imaging><NMR Tomography><Names><Neuroglial Neoplasm><Neuroglial Tumor><Non-Polyadenylated RNA><Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Patients><RNA><RNA Gene Products><RNA vaccine><RNA-based vaccine><Radiography><Refractory><Ribonucleic Acid><Roentgenography><Safety><Secondary to><Techniques><Therapeutic><Tumor Burden><Tumor Load><Tumor-Derived><Vaccines><Visualization><Zeugmatography><adulthood><animal imaging><canine><combat><developmental><diffuse midline glioma><disability><domestic dog><effective therapy><effective treatment><glial-derived tumor><hydrocephalic><immune cell infiltrate><immune drugs><immune-based therapeutics><immunogen><immunogenicity><immunologic therapeutics><immunotherapeutics><immunotherapy agent><lipid based nanoparticle><lipid nanoparticle><longterm survivors><mRNA vaccine><mRNA-based vaccine><malignancy><model of animal><mouse model><murine model><name><named><naming><nano particle><nano-sized particle><nanoparticle><nanoparticle therapy><nanosized particle><neoplasm/cancer><neuroglia neoplasm><neuroglia tumor><novel><pediatric><pediatric brain neoplasm><pediatric brain tumor><pre-clinical><preclinical><radiologic imaging><radiological imaging><response><targeted drug therapy><targeted drug treatments><targeted therapeutic><targeted therapeutic agents><targeted therapy><targeted treatment><therapeutic nanoparticles><tumor>",Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Biotechnology; Brain Cancer; Brain Disorders; Cancer; Clinical Research; Immunization; Immunotherapy; Nanotechnology; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Pediatric Cancer; Rare Diseases; Vaccine Related
MusIC: A multi-scale technology for integrating dynamic cellular function and molecular profiles,MusIC: A multi-scale technology for integrating dynamic cellular function and molecular profiles,"Our objective is develop and rigorously validate a transformative technology that integrates cellular
functions/activities with their deep molecular signatures at single-cell resolution, in high-throughput.
Immunotherapy has emerged as a highly effective approach for the treatment of human cancer, and works by
harnessing the power of the immune system and its ability to recognize and eliminate cancer cells.
Immunotherapy has distinct advantages, including: (i) sustained and durable responses; (ii) defined mechanisms
of action; and (iii) higher specificity and fewer-off target effects than traditional approaches. Along with antibody
immunotherapy, genetically engineering T cells for redirecting immune responses has recently received Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT), based on infusing in vitro expanded T
cells bearing either T-cell receptors (TCR), or chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), have demonstrated dramatic
and durable responses, even in heavily pretreated patients. Despite these initial clinical successes, patient
responses vary widely. Recent correlative data indicate that variability in the manufactured T cell products may
be the primary determinant of clinical success. Since cellular infusion products are a heterogeneous mixture of
cells, mapping the complexity of the population requires the ability to identify the function and molecular profiles
of cells at single-cell resolution. There is an essential need for technologies that are able to map this complexity
in T-cell functionality and being able to link function to molecular profiles at single-cell resolution. We propose
the development and validation of Multiscale Intelligent Convergence (MusIC). MusIC will provide multi-scale
data from molecules to subcellular dynamics to cell-cell interaction biology on the same cells across thousands
of cells. Given the heterogeneity in the composition of cells being used for ACT, it serves as the ideal system for
the development and validation of MusIC. Our team of investigators has expertise in single-cell technology
development and immunotherapy, machine learning, and image analysis and data modeling. We anticipate that
the successful implementation of this proposal will enable the validation of MusIC as a platform for studying
multi-scale cell biology. This in turn, will lead to the more reliable biomanufacturing of T-cell infusion products,
and the engineering of more potent immune cells can have a broad impact on immunotherapy.",<Adoptive Cell Transfers><Antibodies><Apoptosis><Apoptosis Pathway><Assay><B cell malignancy><B lymphoid malignancy><Bar Codes><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Biological Markers><Biology><Biomanufacturing><Body Tissues><CAR T cells><CAR modified T cells><CAR-T><CAR-Ts><CD19><CD19 gene><Cancer Treatment><Cancers><Cell Body><Cell Communication><Cell Cycle><Cell Division Cycle><Cell Function><Cell Growth in Number><Cell Interaction><Cell Locomotion><Cell Migration><Cell Movement><Cell Multiplication><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Proliferation><Cell Therapy><Cell-to-Cell Interaction><Cells><Cellular Assay><Cellular Function><Cellular Migration><Cellular Morphology><Cellular Motility><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Cellular Proliferation><Cellular biology><Classification><Clinical><Clinical Data><Computer Vision Systems><ConvNet><Crosslinker><Cytogenetics><Cytometry><DNA><Data><Deoxyribonucleic Acid><Detection><Development><Disease remission><Engineering><Exhibits><Fixation><Food and Drug Administration><Gene Expression><Goals><Heterogeneity><Human><Image><Image Analyses><Image Analysis><Immune><Immune mediated therapy><Immune response><Immune system><Immunes><Immunological response><Immunologically Directed Therapy><Immunotherapy><In Vitro><Individual><Infusion><Infusion procedures><Intracellular Structure><Investigators><Label><Link><MHC Receptor><Machine Learning><Major Histocompatibility Complex Receptor><Malignant Cell><Malignant Neoplasm Therapy><Malignant Neoplasm Treatment><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Maps><Measurement><Microscopy><Modern Man><Molecular><Molecular Fingerprinting><Molecular Profiling><Motility><Motion><Nuclear Translocation><Oncology><Oncology Cancer><Organelles><Patients><Permeability><Phase><Phenotype><Population><Programmed Cell Death><Proliferating><Property><Protein translocation><Remission><Research Personnel><Researchers><Resolution><Retrieval><Specificity><Subcellular Process><Subcellular structure><System><Systematics><Systems Development><T cells for CAR><T-Cell Antigen Receptors><T-Cell Receptor><T-Cells><T-Lymphocyte><Technology><Therapeutic><Tissues><Training><Transmembrane Protein Transport><Tumor Cell><USFDA><United States Food and Drug Administration><Vaccines><Validation><Work><adoptive cell therapy><adoptive cellular therapy><anti-cancer therapy><antibody immunotherapy><barcode><bio-markers><biologic marker><biomarker><cancer cell><cancer therapy><cancer-directed therapy><cell assay><cell behavior><cell biology><cell imaging><cell mediated therapies><cell morphology><cell motility><cell type><cell-based therapeutic><cell-based therapy><cellular behavior><cellular imaging><cellular therapeutic><cellular therapy><chimeric antigen T cell receptor><chimeric antigen receptor><chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells><chimeric antigen receptor T cells><chimeric antigen receptor fusion protein T-cells><chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells><clinical relevance><clinically relevant><computer vision><contrast imaging><convolutional network><convolutional neural nets><convolutional neural network><data modeling><deep learning based neural network><deep learning neural network><deep neural net><deep neural network><developmental><engineered T cells><genetically engineered T-cells><genotyped patients><host response><image evaluation><image interpretation><imaging><imaging system><immune system response><immune therapeutic approach><immune therapeutic interventions><immune therapeutic regimens><immune therapeutic strategy><immune therapy><immune-based therapies><immune-based treatments><immuno therapy><immunoresponse><infusions><machine based learning><malignancy><manufacture><metabolic profile><migration><model of data><model the data><modeling of the data><molecular profile><molecular signature><morphometry><multi-scale data><multiscale data><nano><neoplasm/cancer><neoplastic cell><patient response><patient specific response><resolutions><response><responsive patient><sample fixation><scRNA-seq><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell technology><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single-cell RNA sequencing><software systems><success><tech development><technology development><technology implementation><technology validation><thymus derived lymphocyte><transgenic T- cells><tumor><validations>,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Genetics; Immunotherapy; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD)
Optimizing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to treat non-malignant disease,Optimizing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to treat non-malignant disease,"Project Summary/Abstract
This proposal outlines the five-year research and career development plans for the PI, Stephen P. Persaud,
MD, PhD, who is preparing for a career as an academic physician-scientist. Dr. Persaud completed his MD
and PhD in immunology in 2015 at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM), then completed his
residency in Clinical Pathology in 2018 at Barnes-Jewish Hospital as part of the Pathology Physician Scientist
Training Program. During his residency elective time, he began postdoctoral research in the lab of John
DiPersio, MD, PhD, in the Oncology Division of the Department of Medicine at WUSM. Dr. DiPersio is an
expert in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), normal and malignant hematopoiesis,
and cellular immunotherapy, and has an outstanding track record of training successful physician-scientists.
The exemplary scientific resources and environment provided by the DiPersio lab and WUSM, combined with
the mentoring and training plans described herein, will enhance Dr. Persaud’s research program and advance
his progress towards becoming an independent investigator. The long-term goal of the proposed research
is to optimize HSCT conditioning, stem cell mobilization, and therapeutic gene editing to safely enable
transplantation for non-malignant hematologic diseases, particularly sickle cell disease (SCD). Dr.
Persaud published the first study showing that CD45- or cKit-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)
combined with Janus kinase 1/2 (JAK1/2) inhibitors could enable fully MHC-mismatched HSCT in mice. This
work was the DiPersio lab’s first contribution to the antibody-based conditioning field and gave rise to several
successful projects, including 1) development of fully myeloablative ADCs suitable for HSCT conditioning in the
context of leukemia therapy, 2) the combination of anti-CD47/cKit antibodies with JAK1/2 inhibitors for toxin-
free allo-HSCT conditioning, and 3) development of a novel streptavidin-based platform for rapid ADC
production and screening. Dr. Persaud will build on this body of work in this proposal via two Specific Aims,
which focus on overcoming the major hurdles to autologous gene therapy for SCD. In Aim 1, he will evaluate
novel stem cell mobilization regimens combining VLA-4 and CXCR4 inhibition and assess their ability to
generate a sufficient quantity and quality of stem cells for autologous gene therapy compared to standard-of-
care regimens. In Aim 2, Dr. Persaud will optimize toxin-free conditioning with anti-CD47/cKit antibodies for
transplantation and cure of SCD, including the development of novel bispecific CD47 x cKit antibodies.
Collectively, these studies will explore the basic biology and translational potential of several novel approaches
for improving the safety and efficacy of HSCT. Although this proposal focuses on autologous gene therapy for
SCD, the work has important implications for both autologous and allogeneic transplantation for malignant and
non-malignant diseases alike. Finally, the research will advance Dr. Persaud’s primary goal of building a
research program dedicated to maximizing the therapeutic benefit of HSCT while minimizing injury to the host.",<Academic Medical Centers><Allogeneic Transplantation><Allogenic><Anemia><Anti-CD47><Antibodies><Antibody-drug conjugates><Area><Autograft><Autologous><Autologous Transplantation><Autotransplant><B220><Basic Research><Basic Science><Bi-specific antibodies><Bifunctional Antibodies><Biology><Bispecific Antibodies><Blood Diseases><Blood Precursor Cell><Blood erythrocyte><CD34><CD34 gene><CD45><CD47><CD47 Antigen><CD47 Glycoprotein><CD47 gene><CD49d-CD29><CSF3><CSF3 gene><CXC-R4><CXCR-4><CXCR4><CXCR4 gene><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cellular immunotherapy><Chimerism><Clinical><Clinical Pathology><D2S201E><DNA Therapy><Dedications><Development><Development Plans><Development and Research><Disease><Disorder><Doctor of Philosophy><Engraftment><Ensure><Environment><Erythrocytes><Erythrocytic><Exposure to><FB22><G-CSF><GCSF><GP180><Gene Transfer Clinical><Genes><Genetic><Genetic Intervention><Goals><Graft Rejection><GvHD><HM89><HPCA1><HSC transplantation><HSY3RR><Harvest><Hb SS disease><HbSS disease><Hematologic Diseases><Hematological Disease><Hematological Disorder><Hematopoiesis><Hematopoietic Cellular Control Mechanisms><Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells><Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization><Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant><Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation><Hematopoietic progenitor Mobilization><Hematopoietic progenitor cell Mobilization><Hematopoietic stem cells><Hemoglobin S Disease><Hemoglobin sickle cell disease><Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder><Histocompatibility Complex><Histocompatibility Complices><Homologous Transplantation><Homologous Wasting Disease><Hospitals><Immunochemical Immunologic><Immunologic><Immunological><Immunologically><Immunologics><Immunology><Immunotherapeutic agent><Injury><Integrin Heterodimer alpha4beta1><Integrin alpha(4)beta(1)><Integrin alpha4beta1><Integrin α4β1><Integrin-Associated Protein><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigators><JAK1><JAK1 gene><JAK1 protein><JAK1A><Jak1 kinase><Janus kinase 1><Jewish><Judaism><LAP3><LCR1><LESTR><LY5><Life Expectancy><MER6><MGC45931><Major Histocompatibility Complex><Major Histocompatibility Complices><Malignant><Malignant -

Targeting breast cancer microenvironment with small molecule agonist of relaxin receptor,Targeting breast cancer microenvironment with small molecule agonist of relaxin receptor,"The therapeutics efficacy of an anticancer treatment is often restricted by tumor fibrous tissue and tumor
microenvironment. Stromal matrix barriers create a sanctuary for breast cancer, while the prolonged pro-fibrotic
stimuli facilitate cancer cell growth and survival by establishing an immunosuppressive environment. Relaxin, a
small peptide hormone, demonstrated dual anti-fibrotic and pro-immunogenic effects in various disease models
including several solid cancers. Treatment with relaxin significantly reduced the expression of major tumor
extracellular matrix components such as collagens, fibronectin, and elastin. The degradation of fibrotic tumor
matrix following relaxin treatment led to reduced cancer cell drug resistance. Additionally, it was shown that
relaxin can change tumor macrophage population from pro-inflammatory to pro-resolution enabling T cell-
mediated cancer cell killing and macrophage phagocytosis. However, due to a short half-life in vivo, delivery of
recombinant relaxin requires continuous infusion. Relaxin signals through its cognate G protein-coupled receptor
RXFP1, which is expressed in tumor associated fibroblasts and infiltrating immune cells. We propose targeting
the integrity of the tumor microenvironment with the first-in-class small molecule agonist of RXFP1 developed in
our laboratories. The lead compound, ML290, shows high activity, oral bioavailability, in vivo stability, and
excellent pharmacological properties. It is well tolerated by animals, shows no toxicity in vivo, and does not
increase cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness nor does it affect extracellular matrix remodeling in healthy
tissues. Our preliminary data indicate that the ML290 treatment of mice with HER2-positive breast cancer
reduces tumor size and tumor fibrotic content. The overall goal of this project is to demonstrate anticancer activity
of relaxin receptor agonist, ML290, in preclinical models of breast cancer, regardless of cancer subtype. We will
test the anti-cancer efficacy of ML290 in primary and metastatic breast cancer models, analyze changes in tumor
ECM composition, recruitment of immune cells, and genomic/proteomic response in stromal and cancer cells to
treatment. We will analyze the effect of combination treatment of ML290 with immune checkpoint blockade and
anti-HER2 immunotherapeutics. The pharmacological re-programing of stromal cancer microenvironment by
ML290 will provide a new therapeutic approach for breast cancer suppression.",<4T1><Abscission><Affect><Agonist><Allografting><American><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related

A Dose Expansion Study of SX-682 Alone and in Combination with Decitabine in MDS Patients,A Dose Expansion Study of SX-682 Alone and in Combination with Decitabine in MDS Patients,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are genetically and morphologically diverse hematopoietic neoplasms that
arise from a small pool of mutant clones within hematopoietic stem and progenitor compartments [1-9]. MDS is
a pre-leukemic syndrome to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Only four drugs have received regulatory approval
for MDS, with the two hypomethylating agents (HMAs) azacitidine and decitabine (iv and oral with cedazuridine)
each with suboptimal response rates (~15-20% for CR+PR) and of limited durability, typically 1-2 years [10].
Once these agents fail, there is no second-line treatment. Prognosis after failure is dismal, with median survival
at <6 months for higher-risk patients, and <18 months for lower-risk patients [11]. That MDS is frequently
characterized by relapse or failure to achieve durable remission, indicates that current treatments do not
adequately eradicate the disease-initiating stem cells. Clearly there is a significant unmet need for a new MDS
treatment in the frontline and HMA-relapsed/refractory (HMA-RR) settings that eradicates leukemic stem cells
and normalizes cytopenias. Chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 (CXCR1/2) and its ligands (CXCL 1, 2,
3, 5, 7 and CXCL8) are elevated in the bone marrow and plasma of patients with AML and MDS where they
drive mutant stem cell growth and correlate with reduced survival [12-16], transfusion dependence [17] and HMA
resistance [14]. CXCR1/2 on MDSCs are pivotal in their recruitment to the bone marrow where they kill
hematopoietic progenitors and impair anti-leukemic immune surveillance [18-20]. Dual CXCR1/2 blockade is
therefore a preclinically validated multi-prong strategy to attack (1) mutant stem cells, (2) the immunosuppressive
marrow microenvironment and (3) hematopoiesis-killing MDSCs, and (4) are implicated in de novo and acquired
HMA-resistance. SX-682 is a clinical-stage, small-molecule CXCR1/2 inhibitor that is in multiple trials in which
it exhibits activity in metastatic melanoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and as a single-agent in HMA-
RR MDS (NCT04245397), where it arrests unrestrained outgrowth of stem and progenitor compartments and
alters the mutant stem and progenitor architecture and inflammatory niche. The specific aims of this proposal
encompass adding additional cohorts to our ongoing MDS trial that will test SX-682 alone and together with oral
or intravenous decitabine in the frontline and HMA-RR settings and the preparation of SX-682 study drug to
support clinical evaluation. Our hypothesis is that de novo or acquired resistance to HMA involves the CXCR1/2
axis, and that adding SX-682 to decitabine will provide efficacy better than either agent alone. The primary
objective is to show preliminary clinical evidence of improved outcomes in patients treated with SX-682 and
decitabine compared to historical data for either agent alone. If successful, SX-682 added to decitabine would
transform the MDS treatment landscape.","<3-10C><5 AZC><5-AC><5-Aza-cytidine><5-Azacytidine><5-Azadeoxycytidine><5-deoxyazacytidine><AMCF-I><AML - Acute Myeloid Leukemia><AZC><Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia><Acute Myelocytic Leukemia><Acute Myelogenous Leukemia><Architecture><Azacitidine><Azacytidine><Blood Plasma><Blood Precursor Cell><Bone Marrow><Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System><C-C-CKR-1><CDw128a><CDw128a Antigens><CDw128b><CMKAR1><CMKAR2><CXC Chemokine Receptor 1><CXCL8><CXCR1><CXCR1 Protein><CXCR1 Receptors><CXCR2><Cancer Model><CancerModel><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Chemokine (C-X-C) Receptor 1><Chemokine Receptor Gene><Clinical><Clinical Evaluation><Clinical Testing><Clinical Trials><Data><Decitabine><Deoxyazacytidine><Dependence><Dezocitidine><Disease><Disease remission><Disorder><Dose><Drugs><Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes><Engineering / Architecture><Enrollment><Exhibits><Failure><GCP1><Good Manufacturing Process><Good manufacturing practice><Hematology><Hematopoiesis><Hematopoietic><Hematopoietic Cell Tumor><Hematopoietic Cellular Control Mechanisms><Hematopoietic Malignancies><Hematopoietic Neoplasms><Hematopoietic Neoplasms including Lymphomas><Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells><Hematopoietic Tumor><Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Cell Neoplasm><Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasms><Hematopoietic stem cells><High Affinity Interleukin 8 Receptor Type A><IL-8><IL-8A Receptors><IL-8RA><IL-8Ralpha><IL8><IL8 Receptor Type 1><IL8 gene><IL8R1><IL8R2><IL8RA><IL8RA gene><IL8RB><IL8RB gene><IL8RBA><Immune Surveillance><Immunologic Surveillance><Immunologic Surveillances><Immunological Surveillance><Immunological Surveillances><Immunosurveillance><Immunotherapeutic agent><Impairment><Inflammatory><Interleukin 8 Receptor><Interleukin 8 Receptor Alpha><Interleukin 8 Receptor Type 1><Interleukin 8 Receptor Type A><Interleukin 8A Receptor><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Intravenous><K60><Leukemic progenitor and stem cell><Ligands><MDNCF Receptors><Malignant Hematopoietic Neoplasm><Marrow><Measures><Medication><Melanoma Metastasis><Metastatic Melanoma><Molecular Configuration><Molecular Conformation><Molecular Stereochemistry><Morphology><Myelodysplastic Disease><Myelodysplastic Syndromes><NAP-1 Receptor><Oral><Pancreas Ductal Adenocarcinoma><Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma><Patients><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Plasma><Plasma Serum><Preleukemia><Preparation><Progenitor Cells><Prognosis><Publishing><Receptor Protein><Refractory><Refractory Anemia with an Excess of Blasts><Refractory anaemia with excess blasts><Relapse><Remission><Resistance><Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma><Risk><SBIR><SCYB8><Sampling><Severities><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Site><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Smoldering Leukemia><Specific qualifier value><Specified><Symptoms><Syndrome><TSG-1><Testing><Time><Transfusion><acute granulocytic leukemia><acute myeloid leukemia><b-ENAP><biological signal transduction><blood cancer><blood cell formation><blood cell progenitor><blood progenitor><blood stem cell><blood-forming stem cell><cancer of blood><cancer of the blood><chemokine receptor><clinical research site><clinical site><clinical test><cohort><conformation><conformational><conformational state><conformationally><conformations><cytopenia><drug/agent><enroll><hematopoietic progenitor><hematopoietic stem progenitor cell><hemopoietic><hemopoietic progenitor><hemopoietic stem cell><high risk><immune drugs><immune-based therapeutics><immunologic therapeutics><immunotherapeutics><immunotherapy agent><improved outcome><inhibitor><ladakamycin><leukemia><leukemic progenitor><leukemic stem cell><manufacture><mutant><myelodysplasia><novel><participant enrollment><patient enrollment><pre-clinical><preclinical><preparations><progenitor><progenitor Cell growth><progenitor growth><receptor><recruit><research clinical testing><resistant><response><small molecule><stem><stem cell growth><stem cells><trial enrollment>",Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Hematology; Rare Diseases; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Human
Validation of a novel treatment for glioblastoma using oncolytic Zika virus,Validation of a novel treatment for glioblastoma using oncolytic Zika virus,"Project Summary / Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive and malignant brain tumor with no known cure. GBM is
projected to account for almost 14,500 new cases and approximately 10,000 deaths in the United States (U.S.)
in 2023. The prognosis for patients afflicted with GBM is incredibly poor, with a median survival of
approximately 8 months and less than 5% of patients surviving 5 years.
Although therapies for GBM exist, these poor outcomes are a direct testament to the treatment challenges.
The difficulty in treating GBM is due to several factors. 1) Treatments must cross the blood brain barrier (BBB)
- this constrains the molecular properties of prospective drug candidates. 2) Treatments must be agnostic to
cell type so GBM cells are preferentially targeted over healthy cells. 3) GBM tumors often contain a population
of glioma stem cells which are highly resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. 4) The immunoinhibitory tumor
microenvironment of GBM renders traditional immunotherapy approaches ineffective.
Due to these challenges GBM treatment has remained largely unchanged for almost 20 years; the current
standard of care is surgical resection followed by radiation and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. The
addition of TMZ to this therapeutic strategy only extended patient survival for a few months yet it is still in use
today since further developments have yet to show more dramatic survival improvements.
The most promising new treatment for GBM is a specialized form of immunotherapy that utilizes oncolytic
viruses (OVs). When the correct virus is chosen it can overcome the obstacles inhibiting other treatment
approaches. Neurotropic viruses are able to effectively cross the BBB, and the correct virus can specifically
and preferentially target GBM cells while avoiding killing healthy cells. Additionally, 50% of tumors are resistant
to TMZ treatment, but OVs remain effective in these tumors. The data suggests OVs can even overcome and
reverse immunosuppressive microenvironments in the tumors.
We have identified two strains of Zika virus (ZIKV) that demonstrate substantial oncolytic activity and the
potential for safe administration to humans. Our testing shows that these strains preferentially infect GBM cells,
and they effectively and dramatically reduce GBM tumors in a mouse model. We have data suggesting these

A Novel Synthetically Engineered Oral Immunotherapy for Treating Ulcerative Colitis,A Novel Synthetically Engineered Oral Immunotherapy for Treating Ulcerative Colitis,"Project Summary
The goal of this project is to develop a novel synthetic biology-based cellular medicine that leverages natural
microbiome pathways to inhibit gut inflammatory processes for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD). Over 3 million adults in the U.S. suffer from IBD, an umbrella term encompassing two chronic
inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract: Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)1. IBD is
typically diagnosed in the second or third decades of life, is life-long, and there is no cure. Current IBD
treatments can have serious side-effects, and patients become refractory. Novel therapies that are safe and
effective, particularly restoring the intestinal membrane barrier, are needed and would be life changing.
Intestinal immune regulatory signals tightly govern healthy gut homeostasis, and their breakdown may result in
IBD40. The human microbiome, harboring trillions of bacteria, is a critical regulator of these mechanisms.
Commensal bacteria function to maintain intestinal epithelial barrier integrity and regulate innate and adaptive
immune cell function41. Surface layer proteins (Slps), including SlpA, SlpB, SlpX, and lipoteichoic acid (LTA)
interact with pattern recognition receptors (PRR) expressed on innate immune intestinal cells to fine immunity
in steady state and diseased conditions42-45. Our research team demonstrated that SlpA is the predominant
anti-inflammatory Slp signal. SlpA binds to the C-type lectin Specific Intracellular adhesion molecule-3
Grabbing Non-integrin homolog-Related 3 (SIGNR3) receptor expressed on dendritic cells lining the gut
prevents experimentally induced colitis in multiple models15. Oral delivery of SlpA via L. lactis (also known as
R-3750 or R110) reduced inflammatory cytokines, strengthened the mucosal membrane barrier, and supported
a healthier microbiota make-up in animal models of gut inflammation20. Notably, the effects and protection
mediated by SlpA were not observed in Signr3-/- mice, suggesting that SlpA interaction with SIGNR3 plays a
key protective role in regulating the disease condition15. New data from our Phase 1 clinical trial in patients
suffering from ulcerative colitis (NCT05666960) showed that R-3750 was safe and yielded promising biomarker
data and clinical outcome results demonstrating clinical proof-of-concept.
Our goal is to develop R-3750, a synthetic biology engineered SlpA-expressing Lactococcus (L.) lactis strain,
as a novel, orally administered drug that functions as immune therapy to reduce gut inflammation, improve
gastrointestinal mucosal barrier function, and restore the natural microbiome make-up in IBD patients. This
CRP application is intended to build upon our prior product development success and advance R-3750 into
Phase 2 clinical testing. The specific aims are: 1) establish 250L scale GMP manufacturing infrastructure, 2)
develop 250L scale process for R-3750 clinical manufacturing, 3) perform clinical GMP manufacturing of R-
3750 Drug Substance, 4) prepare Drug Product for distribution to clinical sites, and 5) obtain FDA regulatory
approval to start a Phase 2 clinical trial.",<21+ years old><Adhesion Molecule><Adult><Adult Human><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Anti-Inflammatories><Anti-Inflammatory

Reducing racial disparities and achieving health equity in lung cancer treatment among the underserved,Reducing racial disparities and achieving health equity in lung cancer treatment among the underserved,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Lung cancer is the most lethal cancer and is responsible for 1.8 million deaths worldwide. Blacks are 15% less
likely to be diagnosed early, 10% more likely to not receive any treatment, and 12% less likely to survive 5
years compared to Whites. Overwhelmingly, there is enough proof that cancer treatments such as platinum-
based chemotherapy drugs, immunotherapy drugs, hormone treatment, anti-inflammatory drugs, combination
treatment, and anti-cancer agents, are effective in prolonging survival. In addition, delays, early termination of
treatments and early termination of treatment cycles occur among the elderly and increase mortality.
Furthermore, there may be important causal factors in relation to patient and provider characteristics that may
influence treatment success. However, we do not know how well it generalizes in terms of risks for survival to
Black non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, a population with higher rates of lung cancer-specific and
all-cause mortality compared to Whites. Our long-term goal is to study the disparities in inequitable cancer
treatments and survival by educating clinicians. Our short-term goal is to document and communicate racial
inequities discovered to clinicians. Our main objective is to determine whether Black NSCLC patients are
receiving comparable cancer treatment to White NSCLC patients that can lengthen their survival. Our central
hypothesis is that there are racial disparities in receiving cancer treatment and treatment combinations, such
as chemotherapy plus immunotherapy that may improve survival. We will use the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network oncologic guidelines for NSCLC to determine standard treatment. To address our specific
aims, we will use a retrospective cohort study design and analyze our data using logistic and survival mixed
models. Our specific aims are to: 1) Determine racial disparities for receipt of cancer treatments, time to
receiving first single cancer treatment/treatment combinations, number of cycles and dose given in NSCLC; 2)
Determine the impact of time on lung-specific survival and overall survival; and 3) Investigate the bidirectional
intersectionality of causal factors in receiving treatment, delays in receiving first treatment, number of cycles,
and dose that impact racial disparities by stage, including patient characteristics (toxicities from cancer
treatments, histology, symptom burden, comorbidities, age, sex, insurance, SES levels, urban/rural area) and
provider characteristics (type of facility, hospital ownership, teaching status, location, and number of hospital
beds). Future studies will be aimed at investigating these Specific Aims in other minority groups, other types of
cancers for which Blacks have decreased survival, and translating the qualitative aspects of treatment
management in NSCLC patients.","<65 and older><65 or older><65 years of age and older><65 years of age or more><65 years of age or older><65+ years><65+ years old><> 65 years><Address><Adenocarcinoma><Advanced Cancer><Advanced Malignant Neoplasm><Affect><Age><Aged 65 and Over><Anemia><Anti-Cancer Agents><Anti-Inflammatories><Anti-Inflammatory Agents><Anti-inflammatory><Antineoplastic Agents><Antineoplastic Drugs><Antineoplastics><Black><Black Populations><Black group><Black individual><Black people><Black race><Blacks><CBDCA><Cancer Cause><Cancer Drug><Cancer Etiology><Cancer Patient><Cancer Treatment><Cancers><Carboplatin><Carboplatino><Cessation of life><Characteristics><Combined Modality Therapy><Communication><Data><Data Bases><Databases><Death><Diagnosis><Disparities><Disparity><Dose><Drugs><Early Diagnosis><Educational process of instructing><Elderly><Endocrine Gland Secretion><Endocrine Therapy><Future><Geographic Area><Geographic Locations><Geographic Region><Geographical Location><Goals><Guidelines><Histology><Hormonal Therapy><Hormones><Hospitals><Immune mediated therapy><Immunologically Directed Therapy><Immunotherapy><Individuals from minority><Individuals of minority><Inequity><Insurance><Knowledge><Location><Logistics><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Malignant Adenoma><Malignant Neoplasm Therapy><Malignant Neoplasm Treatment><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Malignant Tumor of the Lung><Malignant neoplasm of lung><Measures><Mediation><Medication><Minority><Minority Groups><Minority People><Minority Population><Minority individual><Modeling><Multimodal Therapy><Multimodal Treatment><Multitargeted Antifolate><NCCN><NSCLC><NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer><National Comprehensive Cancer Network><Negotiating><Negotiation><Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents><Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer><Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma><Ownership><Patients><Pemetrexed><Performance Status><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Placebos><Platinum><Platinum Black><Population><Progression-Free Survivals><Provider><Pt element><Pulmonary Cancer><Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm><Reporting><Research Design><Retrospective cohort study><Risk><SEER Program><SEER-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results><Sham Treatment><Study Type><Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results><Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program><Survival Rate><Symptom Burden><Teaching><Therapeutic Hormone><Time><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Translating><Treatment Failure><Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents><above age 65><advanced age><after age 65><age 65 and greater><age 65 and older><age 65 or older><age > 65><age of 65 years onward><aged 65 and greater><aged 65+><aged ≥65><ages><aggressive therapy><aggressive treatment><anti-cancer drug><anti-cancer therapy><black patient><cancer survival><cancer therapy><cancer type><cancer-directed therapy><chemotherapy><co-morbid><co-morbidity><combination therapy><combined modality treatment><combined treatment><comorbidity><compare treatment><data base><disparities in race><disparity due to race><drug/agent><early detection><elderly patient><geographic site><geriatric><health equity><hormone therapy><hospital bed><human old age (65+)><immune therapeutic approach><immune therapeutic interventions><immune therapeutic regimens><immune therapeutic strategy><immune therapy><immune-based therapies><immune-based treatments><immuno therapy><improved><inequality due to race><inequity due to race><insight><intersectionalities><intersectionality><lung cancer><malignancy><mortality><multi-modal therapy><multi-modal treatment><neoplasm/cancer><old age><older patient><over 65 years><pulmonary><race based disparity><race based inequality><race based inequity><race disparity><race related disparity><race related inequality><race related inequity><racial disparity><racial inequality><racial inequity><racially unequal><respiratory><rural area><rural location><rural region><senior citizen><sex><sham therapy><standard care><standard treatment><study design><success><systematic review><therapy failure><treatment comparison><treatment guidelines><under served area><under served geographic area><under served location><under served region><underserved area><underserved geographic area><underserved location><underserved region><urban area><urban location><urban region><≥65 years>",Aging; Cancer; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Immunotherapy; Lung; Lung Cancer; Racial and Ethnic Minority Health Research; Rural Health; Social Determinants of Health
Big data and small molecules for Alzheimer's disease,Big data and small molecules for Alzheimer's disease,"ABSTRACT
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by progressive loss of synapses and neurons along with
amyloid and Tau pathologies. Although amyloid-β (Aβ)-reducing immunotherapy received full approval by the
FDA for patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild AD, developing future treatments against AD at all
stages is an urgent priority. One of our recent 12 publications described our cohorts of patients with MCI, mild,
moderate, or severe AD within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System. Using electronic
health records (EHRs), we reported a slower progression to AD among veterans on prescribed vasodilators,
including anti-hypertensive angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs). We compared a spectrum of anti-hypertension, anti-diabetic or anti-hypercholesterolemia medications
and reported a reduced risk of AD onset among vasodilator users (e.g., Valsartan, Carvedilol, Losartan) and an
increased risk of AD onset among vasoconstrictor users (e.g., Propranolol). We also reported that ACEIs reduced
phosphorylated Tau (pTau) in mouse brains. We further reported that Fasudil, a specific vasodilator and a Rho-
associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) 1/2 inhibitor, decreased pTau in human neuro-spheroids. We therefore
propose to perform data mining of 25 million veterans’ 76 billion medical records from the VA Corporate Data
Warehouse and to test the clinical effectiveness of more potent vasodilators, such as a selective ROCK2 inhibitor
Belumosudil, in delaying AD onset among veterans. We will also test if Belumosudil suppresses
neurodegeneration in AD mouse models. Our access to VA EHR as well as our expertise in development and
multidisciplinary analysis of Familial AD mouse models place us in a unique position to test the hypothesis that
vasodilation alleviates cognitive impairment in AD patients as well as memory deficits and neurodegeneration in
AD mouse models. In this competing continuation application, we propose to evaluate the effects of more potent
vasodilators on cognitive impairment of AD patients and AD mouse models (Aim 1). We will perform big data
analysis of EHR to collect vasodilators that are associated with delayed onset of AD, compared to the benchmark
ARB drug Valsartan. We will also test whether vasodilators, such as Belumosudil, alleviate neurodegeneration
and memory impairment in AD mouse models. We will also explore molecular mechanisms of vasodilators using
single nucleus RNAseq and proteomic analyses of AD postmortem brains and mouse models (Aim 2). The
significant impact of the current study is that these small molecules derived from big data mining and validated
in AD mouse models may be fast-tracked to next generation safe therapies of AD.",<ACE Inhibitors><AD dementia><Affect><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer beta-Protein><Alzheimer disease

Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Artificial Intelligence Coordinating Center (AI-CC),Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Artificial Intelligence Coordinating Center (AI-CC),"ABSTRACT
Please see the Volume 1. Technical Proposal.

1. Background and Purpose
The Women’s Health Research Initiative (WHRI) recognizes that women have historically been 
underrepresented in biomedical research, and as a result, there is a lack of understanding of sex 
and gender-related differences in risk factors and health outcomes. The Initiative rightly 
emphasizes a need for the application of novel analytical approaches to rich datasets to elucidate 
these differences, improve our understanding of Women’s Health issues, and inform more effective 
medical interventions.
Initiated in 2014, the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program is part of the 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI’s) broader precision medicine initiative which 
aims to improve the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) disorders 
through tailored and individualized disease treatments. The TOPMed program generates whole 
genome sequencing (WGS) and other –omics data and integrates them with molecular, behavioral, 
imaging, environmental, and clinical data to better understand the biological processes that 
underlie HLBS disorders. Petabytes of –omics, phenotypic and environmental exposure data 
generated by TOPMed from approximately 200,000 research subjects across 90+ studies are fed 
into NHLBI’s BioData Catalyst (BDC) ecosystem and the Database for Genotypes and Phenotypes 
(dbGaP) for use by scientific investigators.
Data collected as part of the TOPMed Program have significant potential to improve women’s 
health outcomes, however, due to the complexity and multi-factorial nature of the data, novel 
methods are needed to discover and measure –omics-level sex differences. Recent advances in 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods have shown significant promise to 
uncover previously unknown statistical associations across a range of therapeutic areas, 
particularly when combining different types of data, such as whole genome sequences, clinical 
measures, and medical imaging. By bringing together TOPMed data, experienced AI and ML 
researchers, and subject matter experts in Women’s Health, with the analytical infrastructure 
provided by the BDC, we will be able to address the long-standing sex-related disparities in 
biomedical research. 
The NHLBI is establishing the Artificial Intelligence – 
Coordinating Center (AI-CC) to serve as a central hub for 
coordinating research projects and bringing together AI 
and scientific experts to collaborate on innovative 
approaches to analyze and interpret TOPMed data. 
Additionally, the AI-CC may support other areas of 
NHLBI’s research interest such as the use of AI on 
imaging and –omics data in the areas of radiomics and 
radiogenomics to advance the understanding of chronic 
lung disease, especially idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
Westat is well-positioned to implement and operate the 
AI-CC due to the significant efficiencies that will be 
gained from our role as the TOPMed Administrative 
Coordinating Center (ACC). Our experience and 
capabilities include: (1) a strong team of staff that 
routinely collaborates with NHLBI, TOPMed investigators, and the BDC team; (2) established and 
effective processes, procedures, and systems that can easily and quickly be adapted and applied to 
the AI-CC; (3) familiarity with TOPMed data and associated analyses; (4) substantial experience 
and established processes for managing sub-Other Transaction Authority (OTA) awards; and 
(5) experience in AI and ML methods. Where feasible, to maximize synergy and to gain most 
efficiencies, we have selected the staff that currently support TOPMed, augmented with other

High frequency oscillations in Alzheimer's disease,High frequency oscillations in Alzheimer's disease,"ABSTRACT
 Electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities in Alzheimer’s disease are poorly understood and can
provide insight into network changes accompanying disease progression and serve as non-invasive
biomarkers. This proposal is based on a novel EEG abnormality that is common very early in life in mouse
models of Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology. The abnormality consists of high frequency oscillations
(HFOs), ultrafast (>250 Hz), and very brief (~30 ms) electrical events in the EEG. Notably, HFOs are known to
occur in epilepsy but their role in Alzheimer’s disease models remains unknown.
 The goals of the proposed project are: (i) to determine the role of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) as a
new type of abnormal Alzheimer’s disease-related electrical biomarker using electrode arrays, (ii) to
manipulate HFOs in real time as a method to boost or repress memory, since impaired memory is a major
symptom of Alzheimer’s disease and last (iii) to test an underlying mechanism contributing to HFOs in
Alzheimer’s disease.
 In Aim 1 we will address the novel hypothesis that HFOs start as a local phenomenon in the hippocampus
and progressively expand into more superficial areas as the mice get older. To this end, we will take advantage
of a novel neurotechnology that uses flexible electrode arrays and a mouse model of cerebral amyloid
overexpression that shows robust HFOs to record longitudinally. We will also test if HFOs precede other
epileptiform abnormalities and reduced gamma power, which are commonly seen in Alzheimer’s disease.
These experiments will tell us if HFOs can be considered an early biomarker. Furthermore, we will ask whether
and how HFOs relate to the other abnormalities.
 In Aim 2 we will address the role of HFOs in impaired memory and test an underlying mechanism. We will
use a novel closed-loop protocol we developed to detect and disrupt HFOs in real time to test whether
selective disruption of HFOs during sleep is beneficial to memory and Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology.
Importantly, our preliminary data suggest that the closed-loop approach improves memory in a mouse model of
Alzheimer’s disease. To address mechanism, we will test a gene therapy approach to reduce HFOs in vivo by
overexpressing a specific K+ channel and test if memory is improved. Notably, our pilot data suggest that
overexpression of this K+ channel reduces HFOs in vivo. Effects of the closed-loop approach or K+ channel
overexpression will be tested on HFOs and other epileptiform activity. Because HFOs occur during a sleep
stage where Aβ is being cleared, we will also stain for soluble Aβ and ask if it is reduced when HFOs are
disrupted.
 This project will address an unmet goal for new and improved biomarkers and two novel strategies to
disrupt them using state-of-the-art methods. It also aims to provide a solid foundation for future investigation of
HFOs in diverse models to address mechanisms and circuits that HFOs utilize in Alzheimer’s disease
pathophysiology. Lastly, we expect the findings and protocols developed in this project to be relevant for a
range of brain disorders affecting memory including epilepsy.",<AD dementia><AD model><Address><Affect><Age><Age Months><Algorithms><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer beta-Protein><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimer's amyloid><Alzheimer's biomarker><Alzheimer's disease biological marker><Alzheimer's disease model><Alzheimers Dementia><Alzheimer’s biological marker><Alzheimer’s disease biomarker><Ammon Horn><Amyloid><Amyloid (Aβ) plaques><Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein><Amyloid Beta-Peptide><Amyloid Plaques><Amyloid Protein A4><Amyloid Substance><Amyloid beta-Protein><Amyloid β><Amyloid β-Peptide><Amyloid β-Protein><Animals><Area><Aβ><Biological Markers><Blood><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Brain><Brain Diseases><Brain Disorders><Brain Nervous System><Cerebrum><Clinical><Cornu Ammonis><DNA Therapy><Data><Dentate Fascia><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Dysfunction><EEG><Electrodes><Electroencephalogram><Electroencephalography><Encephalon><Encephalon Diseases><Epilepsy><Epileptic Seizures><Epileptics><Event><Exhibits><Fascia Dentata><Foundations><Functional disorder><Future><Gene Transfer Clinical><Genetic Intervention><Goals><Gyrus Dentatus><High Frequency Oscillation><Hippocampus><Human><Image><Impairment><Implant><Intracranial CNS Disorders><Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders><Investigation><K channel><Life><Location><Memory><Memory Deficit><Memory impairment><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modeling><Modern Man><Murine><Mus><NREM><Neuritic Plaques><Performance><Physiopathology><Potassium Channel><Potassium Ion Channels><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Repressed Memory><Role><Seizure Disorder><Seizures><Senile Plaques><Sleep><Sleep Stages><Solid><Source><Staining method><Stains><Symptoms><Testing><Tg2576><Time><a beta peptide><abeta><ages><alzheimer model><amyloid beta><amyloid beta plaque><amyloid-b plaque><amyloid-b protein><aβ plaques><beta amyloid fibril><bio-markers><biologic marker><biomarker><brain electrical activity><cerebral><cored plaque><density><dentate gyrus><diffuse plaque><early biomarkers><early detection biomarkers><early detection markers><epilepsia><epileptiform><epileptogenic><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><flexibility><flexible><gene repair therapy><gene therapy><gene-based therapy><genetic therapy><genomic therapy><hippocampal><imaging><improved><improvement on sleep><in vivo><insight><memory consolidation><memory dysfunction><mouse model><multi-electrode arrays><multielectrode arrays><murine model><neuropathologic><neuropathological><neuropathology><neurotechnology><new approaches><new drug target><new druggable target><new pharmacotherapy target><new therapeutic target><new therapy target><non rapid eye movement><non-REM><non-rapid eye movement><nonREM><nonrapid eye movement><novel><novel approaches><novel drug target><novel druggable target><novel pharmacotherapy target><novel strategies><novel strategy><novel therapeutic target><novel therapy target><optogenetics><overexpress><overexpression><pathophysiology><postnatal><primary degenerative dementia><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><sleep improvement><social role><soluble amyloid precursor protein><spatiotemporal>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Brain Disorders; Dementia; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Sleep Research
"Relationship between sleep disturbances, vasomotor symptoms, and cognitive health in Black and Latina midlife women","Relationship between sleep disturbances, vasomotor symptoms, and cognitive health in Black and Latina midlife women","ABSTRACT
AD disproportionately affects women and people of color. With no cure for AD, it becomes important to identify
sex-specific modifiable risk factors at midlife, especially those that affect minority women. For women who reach
midlife, the menopause is a universal transition often accompanied by adverse symptoms that may affect their
later health. Sleep disturbance and vasomotor symptoms (VMS; hot flashes) are among the most common and
bothersome menopausal symptoms and have been associated with AD biomarkers and adverse brain and
cognitive outcomes, particularly verbal memory. Black and Hispanic women typically experience more severe
and persistent VMS, experience more sleep disturbance, and show more persistent memory declines across the
menopause transition compared to White women. Black women also exhibit weaker rest-wake activity rhythms
(RAR), which are associated with worse cognitive performance. Considering the increased burden of VMS, sleep
disturbance, and weakened RAR in black women, these modifiable symptoms may contribute to their more
persistent menopause-related declines in memory and potentially to the greater burden of AD experienced by
black women. The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that VMS, sleep disturbance, and RAR
contribute to worse memory performance in black midlife women and to understand the relative contribution of
each to memory dysfunction. Building on preliminary data from 20 women recruited to date, 70 black and/or
Hispanic peri- and postmenopausal women with moderate to severe VMS will undergo assessment with
wearable devices (VMS monitor and actigraphy watch) to objectively measure VMS, sleep disturbance and RAR
during three consecutive days/nights. Memory will be assessed with a test of verbal memory as well as pattern
separation, a test that yields behavioral indices that align with the function of specific hippocampal subregions.
This innovative study is the study to examine objectively measured menopause symptoms in relation to cognition
in black and Hispanic women with moderate to severe VMS. The study will yield new insights into modifiable risk
factors for memory declines in this understudied group.",<AD dementia><Address><Affect><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer beta-Protein><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer risk factor><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimer's amyloid><Alzheimer's biomarker><Alzheimer's disease biological marker><Alzheimer's disease risk><Alzheimers Dementia><Alzheimer’s biological marker><Alzheimer’s disease biomarker><Ambulatory Monitoring><Ammon Horn><Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein><Amyloid Beta-Peptide><Amyloid Protein A4><Amyloid beta-Protein><Amyloid β><Amyloid β-Peptide><Amyloid β-Protein><Aβ><Behavior assessment><Behavioral><Black><Black race><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Caucasian Females><Caucasian Women><Cognition><Cognitive><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive Manifestations><Cognitive Symptoms><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Communities><Cornu Ammonis><Data><Devices><Disproportionate number of females><Disproportionate number of women><Disproportionately affects females><Disproportionately affects women><Disproportionately impacts females><Disproportionately impacts women><Disproportionately in females><Disproportionately in women><Disturbance in cognition><Doctor of Philosophy><EEG><Electrodermal Response><Electroencephalogram><Electroencephalography><Encephalon><Episodic memory><Exhibits><Face><Female><Frequencies><Galvanic Skin Response><Goals><Health><Hippocampus><Hispanic><Hispanic Females><Hispanic Populations><Hispanic Women><Hispanic group><Hispanic individual><Hispanic people><Hispanics><Hormonal><Hot flushes><Impaired cognition><Individual><Investigation><Knowledge><Latina><Life Cycle><Life Cycle Stages><Link><Measures><Mediating><Mediator><Memory><Memory Deficit><Memory Loss><Memory impairment><Menopausal Symptom><Menopause><Midlife women><Minority Female><Minority Women><Monitor><Names><Neurobehavioral Manifestations><Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms><Night Sweating><Outcome><Outpatient Monitoring><Ovarian hormone><Pattern><Performance><Perimenopausal><Perimenopause><Ph.D.><PhD><Physiologic><Physiological><Play><Population><Post-Menopause><Post-menopausal Period><Postmenopausal Period><Postmenopause><Prevalence><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Psyche structure><Psychogalvanic Reflex><Reproducibility><Research><Rest><Risk><Risk Factors><Role><Rotation><Sampling><Skin Electric Conductance><Sleep><Sleep Architecture><Sleep Disorders><Sleep disturbances><Symptoms><Testing><Training><Wakefulness><White Females><White Matter Hyperintensity><White Women><Woman><Work><a beta peptide><aberrant sleep><abeta><actigraph><actigraphy><after menopause><alzheimer risk><amyloid beta><amyloid-b protein><behavioral assessment><beta amyloid fibril><black female><black women><brain health><circadian><cognitive ability><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive function><cognitive loss><cognitive neuroscience><cognitive performance><density><disrupted sleep><disturbed sleep><experience><faces><facial><female at midlife><female bias><female preponderance><following menopause><group of color><hippocampal><hippocampal subregions><hot flash><impaired sleep><improve symptom><indexing><individual of color><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><irregular sleep><life course><malleable risk><memory decline><memory dysfunction><men><menopause transition><mental><mid life><mid-life><mid-life female><middle age><middle aged><middle-aged female><middle-aged women><midlife><modifiable risk><name><named><naming><neurobehavioral symptom><past menopause><people of color><peri-menopausal><peri-menopause><person of color><population of color><post-menopausal><postmenopausal><postmenopausal status><primary degenerative dementia><processing speed><recruit><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><sex><skin conductance><sleep diseases><sleep disruption><sleep dysfunction><sleep dysregulation><sleep illness><sleep onset><sleep problem><social role><soluble amyloid precursor protein><symptom improvement><symptomatic improvement><transition to menopause><transitional menopause><vasomotor symptoms><verbal><wearable><wearable device><wearable electronics><wearable system><wearable technology><wearable tool><wearables><wireless><women at midlife><women in midlife><women's preponderance>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Dementia; Estrogen; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Menopause; Mental Health; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Prevention; Racial and Ethnic Minority Health Research; Sleep Research; Women's Health Research
Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Artificial Intelligence Coordinating Center (AI-CC),Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Artificial Intelligence Coordinating Center (AI-CC),"ABSTRACT
Please see the Volume 1. Technical Proposal.

1. Background and Purpose
The Women’s Health Research Initiative (WHRI) recognizes that women have historically been 
underrepresented in biomedical research, and as a result, there is a lack of understanding of sex 
and gender-related differences in risk factors and health outcomes. The Initiative rightly 
emphasizes a need for the application of novel analytical approaches to rich datasets to elucidate 
these differences, improve our understanding of Women’s Health issues, and inform more effective 
medical interventions.
Initiated in 2014, the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program is part of the 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI’s) broader precision medicine initiative which 
aims to improve the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) disorders 
through tailored and individualized disease treatments. The TOPMed program generates whole 
genome sequencing (WGS) and other –omics data and integrates them with molecular, behavioral, 
imaging, environmental, and clinical data to better understand the biological processes that 
underlie HLBS disorders. Petabytes of –omics, phenotypic and environmental exposure data 
generated by TOPMed from approximately 200,000 research subjects across 90+ studies are fed 
into NHLBI’s BioData Catalyst (BDC) ecosystem and the Database for Genotypes and Phenotypes 
(dbGaP) for use by scientific investigators.
Data collected as part of the TOPMed Program have significant potential to improve women’s 
health outcomes, however, due to the complexity and multi-factorial nature of the data, novel 
methods are needed to discover and measure –omics-level sex differences. Recent advances in 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods have shown significant promise to 
uncover previously unknown statistical associations across a range of therapeutic areas, 
particularly when combining different types of data, such as whole genome sequences, clinical 
measures, and medical imaging. By bringing together TOPMed data, experienced AI and ML 
researchers, and subject matter experts in Women’s Health, with the analytical infrastructure 
provided by the BDC, we will be able to address the long-standing sex-related disparities in 
biomedical research. 
The NHLBI is establishing the Artificial Intelligence – 
Coordinating Center (AI-CC) to serve as a central hub for 
coordinating research projects and bringing together AI 
and scientific experts to collaborate on innovative 
approaches to analyze and interpret TOPMed data. 
Additionally, the AI-CC may support other areas of 
NHLBI’s research interest such as the use of AI on 
imaging and –omics data in the areas of radiomics and 
radiogenomics to advance the understanding of chronic 
lung disease, especially idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
Westat is well-positioned to implement and operate the 
AI-CC due to the significant efficiencies that will be 
gained from our role as the TOPMed Administrative 
Coordinating Center (ACC). Our experience and 
capabilities include: (1) a strong team of staff that 
routinely collaborates with NHLBI, TOPMed investigators, and the BDC team; (2) established and 
effective processes, procedures, and systems that can easily and quickly be adapted and applied to 
the AI-CC; (3) familiarity with TOPMed data and associated analyses; (4) substantial experience 
and established processes for managing sub-Other Transaction Authority (OTA) awards; and 
(5) experience in AI and ML methods. Where feasible, to maximize synergy and to gain most 
efficiencies, we have selected the staff that currently support TOPMed, augmented with other 
relevant experts. Our approach will not only leverage the efficiencies afforded by the TOPMed 
program, but also provide an efficient and scalable mechanism to support additional research 
areas, beginning with a focus on lung disease.","<AI system><Address><Area><Artificial Intelligence><Award><Behavioral><Biological Function><Biological Process><Biomedical Research><Blood Diseases><Cardiac Diseases><Cardiac Disorders><Chronic lung disease><Clinical><Clinical Data><Collaborations><Computer Reasoning><Data><Data Set><Dedications><Differences between sexes><Differs between sexes><Disease><Disorder><Disparities><Disparity><Ecologic Systems><Ecological Systems><Ecosystem><Environmental Exposure><Exhibits><Familiarity><Female Health><Fibrosing Alveolitis><Gender><Health><Heart Diseases><Hematologic Diseases><Hematological Disease><Hematological Disorder><Image><Infrastructure><Internet><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Investigators><Lung Diseases><Machine Intelligence><Machine Learning><Measures><Medical><Medical Imaging><Methods><Molecular><NHLBI><National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute><Nature><Organization Charts><Outcome><Phenotype><Position><Positioning Attribute><Precision Medicine Initiative><Prevention><Procedures><Process><Progress Reports><Pulmonary Diseases><Pulmonary Disorder><R-Series Research Projects><R01 Mechanism><R01 Program><Radiogenomics><Research><Research Grants><Research Institute><Research Personnel><Research Project Grants><Research Projects><Research Proposals><Research Subjects><Researchers><Risk Factors><Role><Running><Sex Differences><Sexual differences><Sleep Disorders><Structure><System><TOPMed><Therapeutic><Time><Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine><Update><WWW><Woman><Women's Health><Work><authority><blood disorder><catalyst><chronic pulmonary disease><database of Genotypes and Phenotypes><dbGaP><diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis><disease of the lung><disorder of the lung><entire genome><experience><full genome><genome sequencing><heart disorder><idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis><imaging><improved><innovate><innovation><innovative><interest><interventional strategy><lung disorder><machine based learning><machine learning based method><machine learning method><machine learning methodologies><novel><operation><operations><organizational structure><petabyte><programs><radiomics><sex><sex based differences><sex-dependent differences><sex-related differences><sex-specific differences><sleep diseases><sleep dysfunction><sleep illness><sleep problem><social role><success><synergism><web><whole genome><world wide web>",Bioengineering; Lung; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Precision Medicine; Prevention; Women's Health Research
Mapping Synaptic Density in Prodromal and Manifest Lewy Body Dementia,Mapping Synaptic Density in Prodromal and Manifest Lewy Body Dementia,"Project Summary
Synaptic loss is theorized to occur early in the course of common neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as
Alzheimer disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). Until recently, the evaluation of synaptic loss in the
human brain depended on the availability of pathologic/autopsy material, which inevitably did not represent early
stages of disease. In the past few years, development of radiopharmaceuticals that target SV2A, a ubiquitous
synaptic protein, have made it possible to quantify synaptic density in the human brain in vivo. One long-term
goal of the collaborative neuroimaging programs at UW-Madison is to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to understand and detect preclinical stages of neurodegeneration in
AD and ADRD. The objective of this proposal is to use SV2A PET, acquired simultaneously with diffusion and
structural MRI, to evaluate the sequence and topography of synaptic, white matter microstructural, and
volumetric changes that correspond to prodromal and manifest stages of LBD. The central hypothesis is that
lower synaptic density in neocortex and hippocampus will be detectable at earlier disease stages than reductions
in white matter microstructural integrity and will correspond to or predict cognitive decline. The rationale for this
proposal is that participants selected and carefully characterized to represent the spectrum of disease stages
from healthy aging to prodromal LBD will provide a representative cohort from which to draw conclusions
regarding the sequence of brain changes that occur prior to clinical disease onset. For this project we will recruit
160 human research participants, 120 of whom have significant risk factors to develop LBD: Forty participants
with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and normal cognition (RBD-NC), 40 participants with early-
stage Parkinsonism and normal cognition (PD-NC), and 40 participants who meet research criteria for mild
cognitive impairment with Lewy body (MCI-LB), as well as 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We are
experienced in and will perform extensive motor and cognitive characterization of these individuals at baseline
and 2-year follow-up intervals. All participants will undergo structural and diffusion MRI as well as SV2A PET at
baseline; a subset of participants (~35) who show cognitive decline during the study will be re-imaged with SV2A
PET/MRI at follow-up. Using the SV2A PET and MRI data, the specific aims will be to (1) map differences in
synaptic density between control, RBD-NC, PD-NC, and MCI-LB at baseline, (2) determine the relationship
between synaptic density within prespecified neo and allocortical regions and cognitive decline, and (3)
determine the degree to which reduced synaptic density occurs independent of microstructural and structural
change prior to dementia. The significance of this project is that it evaluates important hypotheses regarding
the role of synaptic loss as an early event in and cause of cognitive change in LBD. This project is innovative
because few studies have evaluated SV2A in prodromal stages of LBD, including RBD and MCI-LB. The positive
impact of this work will be to develop biomarkers for the future evaluation of intervention therapies.","<AD dementia><AD pathology><Active Follow-up><Address><Age><Aging><Alzheimer Type

A Safety and Efficacy Study of AAV2-hAADC for AADC Deficiency,A Safety and Efficacy Study of AAV2-hAADC for AADC Deficiency,"The goal of this proposal is to further evaluate the safety and feasibility of gene transfer to provide aromatic L- amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme into the midbrain of patients with AADC deficiency and continue Biologics License Application (BLA)-enabling studies as per FDA recommendations. AADC deficiency is a devastating genetic neurometabolic disorder which causes hypotonia, dystonia, intense and long-lasting oculogyric crises (OGC), developmental delay and chronic and severe neurological dysfunction. A gene therapy based on delivering of a recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying the DDC human gene (AAV2-AADC) to the brain structures that physiologically AADC enzyme (midbrain) could be a most needed disease-modifying treatment for AADC deficiency. Eight (8) AADC deficient patients have been treated (160 µL) in our initial NIH- funded trial in the US under BB-IND-16127 and an additional 15 subjects under an ethics committee-approved compassionate use program (CUP) in Poland. The latter received a larger infusion volume (≤300 μL) and a shorter surgical procedure. Both approaches were safe and well-tolerated regardless of dose or volume of infusion. OGCs stopped a few weeks after the surgery and subjects’ sleep, mood and irritability improved. Most subjects are gaining head control and muscular tone, developing purposeful movements and some are even sitting up and starting to walk without support, regardless of their age. Encouraged by the safety and positive biomarker and clinical outcomes observed in those groups, we propose an extension of the BB-IND-16127 study to (i) determine the long-term (up to 5 years) safety and tolerability of the surgical infusion of already treated subjects (n=8) (ii) determine the safety and tolerability of a larger volume of Cohort 2 vector concentration into the SN/VTA administered via a surgical procedure optimized to increase safety by reducing surgical and anesthesia times (single-cannula insertion per hemisphere) in AADC deficient patients >4 years, and (iii) demonstrate effective restoration of AADC function by measuring CSF neurotransmitter metabolites and changes in brain FDOPA uptake on PET imaging. This will be a multi-center study with subjects to be treated at The Ohio State University and at the University of California San Francisco. As per our discussions with FDA, the study design includes a 12-month lead-in period that will serve as a natural history control group to explore potential efficacy of this novel treatment. Cohorts 3 (4-13 years, n≤12) and 4 (>13 years, n≤12) will then receive a larger infusion volume of AAV2-AADC at the same titer Cohort 2 received (2.6 x 1012 vg/mL; up to 300 μL/hemisphere). Renewal of funding for this trial will enable assessment of the safety and tolerability of an optimized dose and delivery procedure to enhance distribution of AADC expression within the midbrain, which we hypothesize may lead to further clinical improvement. Completion of this exploratory clinical trial will pave the way to registration of this disease-modifying AAV2-hAADC gene therapy for AADC deficiency and future gene therapies for other neurological disorders.","<4 year old><4 years of age><5-HT><5-HTPase><5-Hydroxytryptamine><5-Hydroxytryptophan Decarboxylase><5HT><AADC deficiency><Abnormal Movements><Adrenaline><Age><Amino

Technology-based Sleep Self-Management Intervention for Adults with Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,Technology-based Sleep Self-Management Intervention for Adults with Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for 27% of all stroke-related years of potential life lost before 65
years of age. Sleep disturbance (insufficient sleep, poor quality) and daytime sleepiness (falling asleep during
activities) are highly prevalent following SAH. These symptoms negatively impact overall daily function and
quality of life and increase healthcare use, yet often go undetected or untreated during clinical care. This
proposed study builds upon our prior research, where we found that SAH survivors use patient activation and
self-management strategies in an attempt to improve sleep (e.g., seek knowledge and skills, exercise or relax),
but become frustrated when there is no support or structure to aid their strategies. Our findings suggest that
targeted sleep self-management interventions focusing on patient activation improve sleep in this population.
However, effective interventions focusing on sleep disturbance tailored to SAH have not been reported in the
literature. In this study, we will integrate input from SAH survivors and their caregivers, employ an iterative
human-centered design using a mixed methods approach, and develop a technology-based intervention to
improve self-management skills (patient activation and engagement) for SAH survivors with sleep disturbance.
We will tailor the face-to-face Sleep BETTER 4-week intervention, effective in improving sleep in other chronic
illness populations, to meet the unique needs of SAH survivors, and convert it to a technology-based format
using responsive-design web technology to support deployment over web, tablet, and mobile devices. This
program includes six components: 1) bedroom environment, 2) exercise, 3) tension, 4) time in bed, 5) eating
and drinking, and 6) rhythm for sleep-wake routines. In this study we aim to: 1) Tailor the Sleep BETTER
intervention to meet the unique needs of SAH survivors (e.g., enhanced social support and self-management
skills) to improve sleep disturbance (i.e., self-report sleep quality and daytime sleepiness; actigraphy total
sleep time and sleep efficiency) with 32 SAH survivors and their caregivers, 2) Develop a technology-based
intervention, using an iterative human-centered design and qualitative methods (i.e., iterative cycles of semi-
structured audio-recorded sessions) with 24 SAH survivors and their caregivers, 3) Refine and test the usability
of a technology-based intervention, employing think-aloud observation sessions, the System Usability Scale,
and semi-structured interviews with 32 SAH survivors and their caregivers, and 4) Assess the overall feasibility
and acceptability of collecting primary (i.e., self-report sleep quality and daytime sleepiness; actigraphy total
sleep time and sleep efficiency) and secondary measures (i.e., patient activation, motor or cognitive
impairments, and social support) to refine the intervention protocol. A technology-based intervention to improve
sleep has the potential to reduce health disparities by providing an intervention for SAH survivors who are
typically geographically dispersed with limited access to sleep specialists. Our results will provide critical data
for further development of a large scale randomized controlled trial to improve sleep in this population.","<21+ years old><AIDS Virus><Accounting><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Age><Age Years><Apoplexy><Area><Beds><Behavior><Behavioral><Biological><Brain Vascular Accident><Care Givers><Caregivers><Caring><Cerebral Stroke><Cerebrovascular Apoplexy><Cerebrovascular Stroke><Chronic Disease><Chronic Illness><Clinic Visits><Clinical><Cognitive><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive deficits><Cognitive function abnormal><Data><Decrease health disparities><Development><Disturbance in cognition><Drowsiness><Eating><Economics><Employment><Enrollment><Environment><Event><Exercise><Fatigue><Food Intake><Friends><Frustration><Geography><HIV><Health><Health Care Providers><Health Personnel><Health Promotion><Health disparity mitigation><Health disparity reduction><Healthcare><Healthcare Providers><Healthcare worker><High Prevalence><Human><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Impaired cognition><Impairment><Internet><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Interview><Investigators><Knowledge><LAV-HTLV-III><Lack of Energy><Life><Life Style><Lifestyle><Literature><Lower health disparities><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><Measures><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Methods><Mitigate health disparities><Modern Man><Outcome><Participant><Patient Self-Report><Patients><Performance at work><Personal Satisfaction><Persons><Phase><Population><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Psychological Health><QOL><Qualitative Methods><Quality of life><R-Series Research Projects><R01 Mechanism><R01 Program><Randomized, Controlled Trials><Reduce health disparities><Relaxation><Reporting><Research><Research Grants><Research Personnel><Research Project Grants><Research Projects><Research Resources><Researchers><Resources><Salutogenesis><Self Management><Self-Report><Sleep><Sleep Deprivation><Sleep Disorders><Sleep disturbances><Social support><Somnolence><Specialist><Stroke><Structure><Subarachnoid Hemorrhage><Survivors><Symptoms><System><Tablet Computer><Techniques><Technology><Testing><Time><Training><Translating><United States><Virus-HIV><WWW><Work><aberrant sleep><acceptability and feasibility><actigraph><actigraphy><adult youth><adulthood><ages><annual screening><behavioral sleep health intervention><behavioral sleep health program><behavioral sleep intervention><behavioral sleep strategies><behavioral sleep therapy><behavioral sleep treatment><biologic><brain attack><cerebral vascular accident><cerebrovascular accident><chronic disorder><clinical care><clinical practice><clinical risk><cognitive defects><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive loss><cost effective intervention><cost estimate><cost estimation><daily functioning><deficient sleep><design><designing><developmental><digital><disrupted sleep><disturbed sleep><drinking><economic><effective intervention><enroll><exercise intensity><experience><falls><handheld mobile device><health care><health care personnel><health care worker><health provider><health training><health workforce><healthcare personnel><human centered design><impaired sleep><improved><improvement on sleep><inadequate sleep><innovate><innovation><innovative><insufficient sleep><intervention refinement><interventional strategy><irregular sleep><job performance><life year loss><medical personnel><mobile device><motor impairment><movement impairment><movement limitation><physical conditioning><physical health><programs><promoting health><qualitative reasoning><quality of sleep><randomized control trial><routine screening><skills><sleep debt><sleep deficiency><sleep deficit><sleep diseases><sleep disruption><sleep dysfunction><sleep dysregulation><sleep health><sleep hygiene><sleep illness><sleep improvement><sleep insufficiency><sleep loss><sleep problem><sleep quality><sleepiness><social support network><stroke survivor><stroked><strokes><success><successful intervention><tablet device><technology intervention><technology-based interventions><technology-enabled interventions><technology-focused interventions><treatment provider><usability><web><well-being><wellbeing><willingness><work performance><world wide web><years of life lost><young adult><young adulthood>",Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Cerebrovascular; Neurosciences; Prevention; Sleep Research; Stroke
Empowering Advanced Alzheimers Disease and Dementia Research Through Remote Patient Monitoring and Cloud-Connected Wearable Devices,Empowering Advanced Alzheimers Disease and Dementia Research Through Remote Patient Monitoring and Cloud-Connected Wearable Devices,"Project Summary
Last year, the care and treatment of roughly 6 million people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and related
dementias cost the U.S. approximately $593 billion dollars. The tremendous costs associated with Alzheimer's
disease include direct medical costs, such as doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription drugs, as well as
indirect costs such as lost wages and productivity for both the affected individuals and their caregivers. According
to the Alzheimer's Association, the total cost of care for the estimated 13 million individuals with Alzheimer's and
other dementias in the United States by 2050 is projected to reach $1.1 trillion. Emerging lifestyle intervention
research is testing whether changes in physical exercise, sleep, socialization, and sedentary behaviors have an
impact on disease onset and progression of symptoms throughout the lifespan. Unfortunately, obtaining real-
world patient-generated health and behavior information to support this research from aging populations is
challenging and often relies on unreliable self-reporting. After years of meetings with 70+ investigators and
scientists at the NIH, the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers,
numerous universities, and the Alzheimer's Association we determined and agreed that a consolidated database
of real-life, digital health information does not exist for Alzheimer's and dementia research. During Amissa's
SBIR Phase I, we created software to measure and collect physiological health data passively and unobtrusively
from non-stigmatizing smartwatches including the Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy watch. This SBIR Phase
II project is critical to expanding that R&D and improving remote health measurements, collecting and sharing
rich digital health datasets, and identifying potential digital biomarkers that correlate to disease detection,
progression, and prevention. Our two software innovations will enable scientific researchers across the world to
utilize consumer-grade smartwatches as passive remote patient monitoring solutions. Researchers, labs,
universities, and healthcare practitioners will be able to create accounts on our platform, enroll her/his volunteer
subjects/patients for a study, and use our free software to collect longitudinal information including health vitals
and behavior data. Specific Aim 1: Develop A Research Platform and Real-World Health Data Marketplace To
Support Academic Research and Enterprise Partnerships. During Phase II R&D, Amissa Health will collaborate
with experts from Wake Forest University, Harvard Medical School, the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease
Research Center, Atrium/Advocate Health, Edge Analytics, and Microsoft to develop the first shared research
platform that will apply longitudinal, real-world, wearable sensor measurements to advance research of
dementia-related digital biomarkers and behavioral interventions. Specific Aim 2: Working with Edge Analytics,
a healthcare-focused data science firm that develops prototypes to production-ready algorithms, we will fine-
tune edge computing algorithms and smartwatch sensor data collection and compression techniques to
maximize real-time health data measurement and collection areas with poor cellular and/or Wi-Fi networks.",<AD dementia><AD related dementia><ADRD><AI system><Academia><Academic support><Advocate><Affect><Aging><Agreement><Algorithms><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimer's and related dementias><Alzheimer's disease and related dementia><Alzheimer's disease and related disorders><Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia><Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder><Alzheimer's disease or related dementia><Alzheimer's disease related dementia><Alzheimers Dementia><Amentia><Apple><Apple watch><Area><Artificial Intelligence><Atrial><Award><Behavior><Behavior Conditioning Therapy><Behavior Modification><Behavior Therapy><Behavior Treatment><Behavioral Conditioning Therapy><Behavioral Modification><Behavioral Therapy><Behavioral Treatment><Cardiac Atrium><Care Givers><Caregivers><Caring><Cohort Studies><Collaborations><Collection><Computer Reasoning><Computer software><Computerized Medical Record><Concurrent Studies><Conditioning Therapy><Country><Data><Data Bases><Data Collection><Data Compression><Data Science><Data Security><Data Set><Data awareness><Databases><Decentralization><Decision Making><Dementia><Detection><Development and Research><Devices><Diagnosis><Digital biomarker><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Drug Prescribing><Drug Prescriptions><Electronic Health Record><Electronic Medical Record><Enrollment><FHIR><Facilities and Administrative Costs><Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources><Future><Galaxy><General Hospitals><Health><Health system><Healthcare><Heart Atrium><Hospitals><Indirect Costs><Individual><Industry><Industry Standard><Ingestion><Intervention Studies><Investigators><Length of Stay><Licensing><Life><Machine Intelligence><Malus domestica><Massachusetts><Measurement><Measures><Medical><Medical Care Costs><Metadata><Methods><Monitor><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Number of Days in Hospital><Onset of illness><Patient Care><Patient Care Delivery><Patient Data Confidentiality><Patient Data Privacy><Patient Self-Report><Patients><Performance><Persons><Pharmaceutical Agent><Pharmaceuticals><Pharmacologic Substance><Pharmacological Substance><Phase><Physical Exercise><Physiologic><Physiological><Population><Prevention><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Production><Productivity><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Provider><R & D><R&D><Research><Research Personnel><Research Support><Researchers><SBIR><Salaries><Schedule><Scientist><Secure><Sedentary behavior><Sedentary life-style><Self-Report><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Societies><Software><Specific qualifier value><Specified><Speed><Symptoms><System><Techniques><Testing><Time><Transmission><United States><United States National Institutes of Health><Universities><Validation><Visit><Wages><WiFi><World Health><analytical tool><applewatch><atrium><behavior intervention><behavioral intervention><body sensor><body worn sensor><care costs><care for patients><care giving><care of patients><caregiving><caring for patients><cloud based><compression algorithm><computerized data processing><cost><cost of dementia><data access><data base><data exchange><data interoperability><data processing><data transfer><data transmission><depository><design><designing><digital><digital health><digital marker><disease onset><disorder onset><electronic health care record><electronic health medical record><electronic health plan record><electronic health registry><electronic medical health record><empowerment><enroll><health care><health data><hospital days><hospital length of stay><hospital stay><improved><information security><ingest><innovate><innovation><innovative><internet portal><interoperability><intervention research><interventional research><interventional study><interventions research><large data sets><large datasets><life span><life style intervention><lifespan><lifestyle intervention><medical college><medical costs><medical expenses><medical schools><medication prescription><meeting><meetings><meta data><on-line portal><online portal><pharmaceutical><population health><prescribed medication><primary degenerative dementia><prototype><remote health monitoring><remote patient monitoring><repository><research and development><resilience><resilient><school of medicine><sedentary lifestyle><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><sensor><sleep behavior><sleep habit><smart watch><smartwatch><socialization behavior><success><telehealth><transmission process><validations><volunteer><wearable><wearable biosensor><wearable device><wearable electronics><wearable sensor><wearable sensor technology><wearable system><wearable technology><wearable tool><wearables><web portal><web-based portal><wi-fi><wireless fidelity>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment;

A novel closed-loop feedback neuromodulation system for improving slow wave sleep in Alzheimer's disease patients,A novel closed-loop feedback neuromodulation system for improving slow wave sleep in Alzheimer's disease patients,"Project Summary Abstract
 Sleep disturbances are a common facet of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affecting 20-40% of
patients in the mild to moderate stage of the illness. There is strong evidence that poor sleep
accelerates the progress of AD through the failure to clear brian toxins during sleep. Research
has shown that promoting healthy sleep, specifically slow wave sleep (SWS), reversed the
accelerating impacts of disrupted sleep in AD patients and reduced their annual increases in AD
biomarkers, reduced cognitive decline, stabilized depressive symptoms, and improved
psychopathological behavior. There is increasing evidence that promoting sleep, specifically
healthy sleep architecture, reduces the risk of poor sleep accelerating AD. However, there are
currently no approved therapies that are specifically designed to promote sleep and healthy
sleep architecture in AD patients and patients at high risk for AD. Thus, there is a significant
unmet clinical need to develop a sleep promoting device that is well tolerated by pre-AD and
early-stage AD patients.
 Our innovation is a device that promotes sleep onset, sleep duration, and the ideal sleep
stage architecture including SWS, to prevent the disease accelerating impacts of disrupted
sleep on AD patients. The goal of this Phase I project is to create a testable prototype that can
sense sleep architecture and provide peripheral neuromodulation stimulation to individuals over
the age of 65, a group with an elevated risk of AD. Successful completion of this Phase I effort
will position us to demonstrate in clinical studies that our device improves SWS in early-stage
AD patients and reduces AD biomarkers. Our final commercialized device will be a comfortable
low-profile medical device that promotes healthy sleep in high-risk and early-stage AD patients
and reverses the accelerating effects of disrupted sleep for millions of AD patients.",<21+ years old><65 and older><65 or older><65 years of age and older><65 years of age or more><65 years of age or older><65+ years><65+ years old><> 65 years><AD dementia><Acceleration><Accessory Sinuses><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><Age><Aged 65 and Over><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer beta-Protein><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer risk factor><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimer's amyloid><Alzheimer's biomarker><Alzheimer's disease biological marker><Alzheimer's disease patient><Alzheimer's disease risk><Alzheimer's patient><Alzheimers Dementia><Alzheimer’s biological marker><Alzheimer’s disease biomarker><Amentia><American><Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein><Amyloid Beta-Peptide><Amyloid Protein A4><Amyloid beta-Protein><Amyloid β><Amyloid β-Peptide><Amyloid β-Protein><Apertura Sinus Maxillaris><Architecture><Area><Autonomic nervous system><Aβ><Behavior><Cause of Death><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Clinical Trials><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Data><Delta Wave><Delta Wave sleep><Dementia><Deposit><Deposition><Detection><Devices><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Disturbance in cognition><EEG><Economic Burden><Electroencephalogram><Electroencephalography><Emotional Depression><Engineering / Architecture><Eye><Eyeball><Face><Failure><Feedback><Forehead><Future><Goals><Hand><Health Care Costs><Health Care Systems><Health Costs><Healthcare Costs><Healthcare Systems><Heating><Human><Impaired cognition><In Vitro><Individual><Investigators><Liquid substance><MT-bound tau><Masks><Maxillary Antrum><Maxillary Sinus><Medical><Medical Device><Minor><Modern Man><NREM><Nasal Sinuses><Nasal cavity/Paranasal><Nasal cavity/Paranasal sinuses><Onset of illness><Paranasal Sinuses><Participant><Pathogenicity><Patients><Peripheral><Phase><Phase 2 Clinical Trials><Phase II Clinical Trials><Position><Positioning Attribute><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Prospective Studies><Proteins><Questionnaires><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Risk><Risk Reduction><Sinus><Skin><Skin Temperature><Sleep><Sleep Architecture><Sleep Disorders><Sleep Stages><Sleep disturbances><Slow-Wave Sleep><Surface><System><Temperature><Testing><Time><Toxin><Treatment Efficacy><United States><Validation><Variant><Variation><a beta peptide><aberrant sleep><abeta><above age 65><adulthood><after age 65><age 65 and greater><age 65 and older><age 65 or older><age > 65><age of 65 years onward><aged 65 and greater><aged 65+><aged ≥65><ages><alzheimer risk><amyloid beta><amyloid-b protein><beta amyloid fibril><burden of disease><burden of illness><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive loss><commercialization><cost estimate><cost estimation><dementia risk><depression symptom><depressive><depressive symptoms><design><designing><disease burden><disease onset><disorder onset><disrupted sleep><disturbed sleep><efficacy testing><experience><faces><facial><fluid><foot><hands><high risk><highmore antrum><highmori antrum><human old age (65+)><impaired sleep><improved><improvement on sleep><in vitro testing><innovate><innovation><innovative><intervention efficacy><irregular sleep><liquid><microtubule bound tau><microtubule-bound tau><neural control><neural regulation><neuromodulation><neuromodulatory><neuroregulation><new approaches><non rapid eye movement><non-REM><non-rapid eye movement><nonREM><nonrapid eye movement><novel><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><old age><over 65 years><patient living with Alzheimer's disease><patient suffering from Alzheimer's disease><patient with Alzheimer's><patient with Alzheimer's disease><personalization of treatment><personalized medicine><personalized therapy><personalized treatment><phase II protocol><poor sleep><prevent><preventing><primary degenerative dementia><product development><prototype><quality of sleep><reduce risk><reduce risks><reduce that risk><reduce the risk><reduce these risks><reduces risk><reduces the risk><reducing risk><reducing the risk><risk factor for dementia><risk for dementia><risk-reducing><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><sensor><sleep diseases><sleep disruption><sleep dysfunction><sleep dysregulation><sleep illness><sleep improvement><sleep onset><sleep problem><sleep quality><soluble amyloid precursor protein><tau><tau Proteins><tau factor><therapeutic efficacy><therapy efficacy><usability><validations><voltage><wearable><wearable device><wearable electronics><wearable system><wearable technology><wearable tool><wearables><τ Proteins><≥65 years>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment;

Circumventing the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic limitations of antioxidant therapy for Parkinson's Disease by nose to brain delivery of N-acetylcysteine,Circumventing the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic limitations of antioxidant therapy for Parkinson's Disease by nose to brain delivery of N-acetylcysteine,"Abstract
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects over 1 million U.S. citizens. PD is most
often diagnosed in people over the age of 60, while only 4% of cases of PD are diagnosed before age 50, making
age the biggest risk factor for the development of PD. The four cardinal features of PD include tremor, rigidity,
bradykinesia, and postural instability, often associated with non-motor symptoms including depression, anxiety,
sleep behavior disorders, constipation, loss of sense of smell, and cognitive impairment. The most prominent
PD pathology is degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the ventrolateral tier of the pars compacta of the
substantia nigra in the midbrain and the formation of α-synuclein cytoplasmic inclusions throughout the brain.
While current medical therapies for PD significantly improve the quality of life of PD patients, none of these
therapies has been convincingly shown to slow or prevent the progression of PD, requiring the development of
treatments that can provide greater neuroprotection. To address these issues, Entobee Therapeutics
proposes to repurpose N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a well-studied, safe, FDA-approved drug, to manage PD.
Given the pathogenetic role of oxidative damage in PD, Entobee hypothesizes that targeted antioxidant
intervention with NAC may reduce or halt the progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration associated with
PD. However, the administration of NAC has limitations in both intravenous and oral forms. Thus, Entobee
proposes the creation of a novel intranasal (IN) nose-to-brain (N2B) treatment option to bypass first-pass hepatic
gastrointestinal metabolism and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for faster outpatient and simple chronic care. The
overall objective of this Phase I project is to identify a safe IN N2B dose of NAC with equivalent or better brain
bioavailability compared to the 50 mg/kg i.v. NAC dose associated with dopaminergic improvement in PD
patients using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure NAC-derived GSH in disease-relevant regions of
the brain. This will be accomplished through the following aims: 1) Establish the regional (striatum, midbrain, and
cortex) and temporal (1–6 h and 24 h) single-dose bioavailability profile of 50 mg/kg i.v. NAC in PD patients, 2)
Compare the single-dose bioavailability and safety profiles of 200 mg and 400 mg IN N2B NAC versus 50 mg/kg
i.v. NAC bioavailability profile in PD patients, 3) Confirm the single-dose safety and tolerability of an equally
bioavailable IN N2B NAC dose in PD patients.","<Acetylcysteine><Acetylin><Address><Affect><Age><Airbron><American><Antioxidants><Anxiety><Basal Ganglia><Basal Nuclei><Behavior Disorders><Benchmarking><Best Practice Analysis><Bioavailability><Biological Availability><Blinded><Blood - brain barrier anatomy><Blood-Brain Barrier><Bradykinesia><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Brain region><Broncholysin><Brunac><Bypass><Chronic><Chronic Care><Clinical><Clinical Investigator><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Clinical Trials><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Collaborations><Constipation><Corpus Striatum><Corpus striatum structure><Cranial Nerve V><Cysteine><Cytoplasmic Inclusion><DA Neuron><DAT dopamine transporter><Deacetylation><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Development><Diagnosis><Disease><Disorder><Disturbance in cognition><Dopamine neuron><Dose><Drug Kinetics><Drug Precursors><Drugs><Encephalon><Exhibits><FDA approved><Fabrol><Fifth Cranial Nerve><Fluatox><Fluimucetin><Fluimucil><Fluprowit><Genetic><Glutathione><Goals><H+ element><Half-Cystine><Hemato-Encephalic Barrier><Hepatic><Human><Human Volunteers><Hydrogen Ions><IV Infusion><Impaired cognition><In Situ><Intermediary Metabolism><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Intravenous><Intravenous infusion procedures><L-Cysteine><MR Spectroscopy><Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy><Measures><Medical><Medication><Membrane Transport Proteins><Membrane Transporters><Mental Depression><Mercapturic Acid><Mesencephalon><Metabolic Processes><Metabolism><Mid-brain><Midbrain><Midbrain structure><Modern Man><Mole the mammal><Moles><Muco Sanigen><Mucocedyl><Mucolator><Mucolyticum><Mucomyst><Mucosolvin><Mucret><N-Acetylcysteine><NAC Zambon><NAC precursor><Nasal><Nasal Passages Nose><Neo-Fluimucil><Nerve Degeneration><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Nervus Trigeminus><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neuromodulator><Neuron Degeneration><Nose><Nose Diseases><Occipital lobe><Olfaction><Oral><Out-patients><Outpatients><PARK1 protein><PARK4 protein><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Parvolex><Pathology><Patients><Persons><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Pharmacodynamics><Pharmacokinetics><Pharmacological Treatment><Phase><Physiologic Availability><Placebo Control><Prefrontal Cortex><Primary Parkinsonism><Pro-Drugs><Process><Prodrugs><Protons><Publishing><QOL><Quality of life><Randomized><Reporting><Research><Respaire><Respiratory System, Nose, Nasal Passages><Risk Factors><Role><SNCA><SNCA protein><Safety><Smell><Smell Perception><Stream><Striate Body><Striatum><Substantia Nigra><Substantia nigra structure><Therapeutic><Tixair><Tremor><Trigeminal Nerve><Trigeminal nerve structure><Universities><Work><a-syn><a-synuclein><ages><alpha synuclein><alpha synuclein gene><alphaSP22><antioxidant therapy><asyn><behavioral disorder><benchmark><bloodbrain barrier><clinical applicability><clinical application><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive loss><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><depression><design><designing><develop therapy><developmental><disease diagnosis><dopamine transporter><dopaminergic neuron><drug/agent><effective therapy><effective treatment><gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly><gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine><gastrointestinal><improved><interest><intervention development><interventional strategy><intravenous infusion><nasal disorder><neural degeneration><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neurodegenerative illness><neurological degeneration><neuronal degeneration><neuroprotection><neuroprotective><neurorestoration><neurorestorative><neurotoxic><non A-beta component of AD amyloid><non A4 component of amyloid precursor><non-motor symptom><nonmotor symptom><nose disorder><novel><occipital cortex><odor perception><olfactory perception><oxidative damage><oxidative injury><pars compacta><placebo controlled><posture instability><preservation><prevent><preventing><randomisation><randomization><randomly assigned><sleep behavior><sleep habit><social role><striatal><therapy development><treatment development><α synuclein gene><α-syn><α-synuclein>",Aging; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Complementary and Integrative Health; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease
"Housing, Environment, And Living Conditions for Transformed Health (HEALTHe Birmingham)","Housing, Environment, And Living Conditions for Transformed Health (HEALTHe Birmingham)","Abstract
Disparities in lung disease and other chronic conditions between poor, mostly Black residents of public housing
communities and the general population are profound, leading to an extraordinary human and economic
burden. Rooted in structural inequalities, these disparities are exacerbated by the conditions of daily life,
including housing and neighborhood physical (built) and social environment. Together, adverse housing and
neighborhood conditions increase disease risk through multiple pathways, including behavioral and biological.
Despite compelling evidence of the health effects of neighborhoods, few interventions have examined the
extent to which specific modifications of housing and neighborhood conditions improve health outcomes. The
proposed study, Housing, Environment, And Living Conditions for Transformed Health (HEALTHe
Birmingham), aims to fill this research gap. Taking advantage of a major investment by federal and local
government, businesses, and organizations, we will evaluate, in a natural experiment, the health effects of a
comprehensive intervention that addresses multiple social determinants of health (SDoH): public housing
quality and features of the neighborhood built and social environments (Aim 1). Recognizing that major
community revitalization efforts are not always possible, to generate solutions that are potentially more feasible
and have wider reach, we also will conduct a prospective trial to determine whether less-expensive
improvements, such as indoor air purification, can positively impact lung health in public housing sites not
undergoing housing renovation, comparing a site exposed to industrial pollution vs one less contaminated
(Aim 2). To bolster the public health and policy implications of this research, we will conduct cost-effectiveness
analyses from economic and societal perspectives and use implementation science to prioritize intervention
strategies, recommend scale-up efforts across communities and contexts, and inform policy on federal and
local levels. We also will assess the extent to which specific components impact health equity between
intervention and control communities (Aim 3). Study findings will facilitate translation of SDoH interventions
into practice, inform public policy across locations and contexts, and contribute to the evidence base of
reducing health inequity through action on SDoH.",<Address><Affect><Area><Award><Behavioral><Biological><Black><Black race><Businesses><Cardiac Diseases><Cardiac Disorders><Censuses><Chronic><Chronic Disease><Chronic Illness><Cities><Communities><Computerized Medical Record><Cost Analyses><Cost Analysis><Cost Effectiveness Analysis><Crime><Data><Decrease health disparities><Diabetes Mellitus><Diet><Disease><Disorder><Disparities><Disparity><Economic Burden><Education><Educational aspects><Electronic Medical Record><Environment><Environmental Exposure><Environmental Pollution><Evaluation><Exposure to><Federal Government><Focus Groups><General Population><General Public><Generations><Grant><Green space><Health><Health Inequity><Health Promotion><Health behavior><Health disparity mitigation><Health disparity reduction><Heart Diseases><Housing><Housing and Urban Development><Human><Indoor Air Quality><Industrialization><Inequalities in Health><Inequality><Inequities in Health><Inflammation><Instruction><Internet><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Interview><Investigators><Investments><Knowledge><Learning><Libraries><Life><Local Government><Location><Lower health disparities><Lung Diseases><Mitigate health disparities><Modern Man><Modification><Motivation><National Government><Natural experiment><Neighborhoods><Outcome><Pathway interactions><Physical activity><Physical environment><Physiologic><Physiological><Policies><Pollution><Privatization><Program Development><Public Health><Public Housing><Public Policy><Pulmonary Diseases><Pulmonary Disorder><Recommendation><Reduce health disparities><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Salutogenesis><Site><Sleep><Social Environment><Social Service><Social Work><Survey Instrument><Surveys><Technology><Time><Translations><U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development><WWW><Workforce Development><assess cost><assess effectiveness><authority><biologic><built environment><chronic disorder><college><collegiate><comparative cost effectiveness><compare cost effectiveness><compare to control><comparison control><cost assessment><cost effectiveness><cost efficient analysis><cost evaluation><cost-effective analysis><determine effectiveness><diabetes><diets><disease of the lung><disease risk><disorder of the lung><disorder risk><disparity in health><economic analysis><economic assessment><economic evaluation><effectiveness assessment><effectiveness evaluation><endothelial dysfunction><environmental contamination><evaluate cost><evaluate effectiveness><evidence base><examine cost><examine effectiveness><greenspace><health disparity><health equity><health inequalities><health related behavior><heart disorder><implementation efforts><implementation science><improved><indoor air><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><interventional strategy><lung disorder><lung health><multiple data types><pathway><physical conditioning><physical health><policy implication><promoting health><prospective><pulmonary health><scale up><social><social climate><social cohesion><social context><social culture><social health determinants><socio-cultural><sociocultural><socioenvironment><socioenvironmental><stress reactivity><translation><translational opportunities><translational potential><web><world wide web>,Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Cost Effectiveness Research; Dissemination and Implementation Research; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Health Effects of Indoor Air Pollution; Lung; Physical Activity; Prevention; Social Determinants of Health
Ring wearable sensor use for diagnosis and monitoring of Parkinson's disease in underserved rural populations,Ring wearable sensor use for diagnosis and monitoring of Parkinson's disease in underserved rural populations,"Abstract
The objective of this project is to develop an innovative ring sensor system, to be worn on the finger, for the
diagnosis and monitoring of Parkinson's disease (PD) in underserved rural populations. Rural regions of the US
have been observed to be disproportionately impacted by PD due to higher rates of diagnosis, while also lacking
access to neurologists and other allied health professionals, who are overconcentrated in urban areas with
academic medical centers. As a result, rural PwPD may be diagnosed later in the disease process and have
fewer specialty care visits which leads to increased hospitalizations, morbidity and decreased quality of life. The
proposed inexpensive, easy-to-use ring can be worn daily, adjustable to any finger and used to support both
early diagnosis and ongoing symptom management. This ring could be used as a screening tool to detect PD
and alert primary care physicians (PCP) much earlier than typical. It could also be used as a tool to aid in the
remote management of PD as movement disorder specialists could use the data to assess medication timing
and management or deep brain stimulation (DBS) programming settings. The proposed system is designed with
a rural low-income user in mind. No Internet connection or smartphone/computer technology is required.
Wearable sensors for medical use in PD patients are plagued with usability concerns, many focused on the
stigma associated with wearing them in prominent locations. They also typically require a smartphone, app
and/or Internet connectivity which may limit their applicability for rural populations. There is therefore a need for
a discreet device without the need for Internet connectivity to be useful for rural PwPD. Newly available
ultraminiature high-capacity curved battery and IMU technologies make the proposed ring technically feasible at
this time.",<65 and older><65 or older><65 years of age and older><65 years of age or more><65 years of age or older><65+ years><65+ years old><> 65 years><Academic Medical Centers><Accelerometer><Affect><Aged 65 and Over><American><Back><Benign Essential Tremor><Body System><Bradykinesia><Calibration><Caring><Cell Phone><Cellular Phone><Cellular Telephone><Clinical Evaluation><Clinical Testing><Cognition><Complex><Computer software><Computers><Data><Deep Brain Stimulation><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Development><Development and Research><Devices><Diagnosis><Disease><Disorder><Distal><Dorsum><Drugs><Dysfunction><Dyskinesia Syndromes><Early Diagnosis><Electrical Engineering><Electrodermal Response><Engineering><Equilibrium><Essential Tremor><Farm><Fingers><Forearm><Functional disorder><Gait><Galvanic Skin Response><Hand><Hearing Aids><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Internet><Location><Low income><Measurement><Medical><Medical Electronics><Medication><Minnesota><Mobile Phones><Monitor><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Motion><Motor><Movement><Movement Disorder Syndromes><Movement Disorders><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neurologist><Neurosurgeon><Occupational Therapist><Onset of illness><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Organ System><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Patients><Performance><Persons><Pesticides><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phase><Physiopathology><Primary Care Physician><Primary Parkinsonism><Process><Pronation><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Psychogalvanic Reflex><QOL><Quality of life><R & D><R&D><Radio><Records><Remote management><Rest><Rest Tremor><Rural><Rural Population><Rural group><Rural people><Screening procedure><Secure><Skin Electric Conductance><Sleep><Software><Specialist><Specialty><Speech><Supination><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><System><Technology><Time><Training><Tremor><Universities><University Medical Centers><Visit><WWW><Work><Wrist><above age 65><absorption><accelerometry><activity monitor><activity tracker><after age 65><age 65 and greater><age 65 and older><age 65 or older><age > 65><age of 65 years onward><aged 65 and greater><aged 65+><aged ≥65><alleviate symptom><allied health professional><ameliorating symptom><arm><assistive hearing device><assistive listening device><balance><balance function><body movement><body sensor><body worn sensor><clinical test><decrease symptom><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><design><designing><developmental><disease onset><disorder onset><drug/agent><early detection><experience><fewer symptoms><glucose sensor><hands><hearing amplification><hearing assistance><hearing assistive device><hearing device><human old age (65+)><iPhone><improved><innovate><innovation><innovative><instrumentation><manage symptom><medical specialties><neuro-surgeon><neurodegenerative illness><old age><over 65 years><pathophysiology><profession allied to medicine><reduce symptoms><relieves symptoms><research and development><research clinical testing><rural area><rural environment><rural individual><rural location><rural region><rural under served><rural underserved><screening tools><sensor><skin conductance><smart phone><smartphone><social stigma><stigma><surgery><symptom alleviation><symptom management><symptom reduction><symptom relief><tool><urban area><urban location><urban region><usability><wearable><wearable biosensor><wearable device><wearable electronics><wearable sensor><wearable sensor technology><wearable system><wearable technology><wearable tool><wearables><web><wireless><world wide web><≥65 years>,Aging; Assistive Technology; Behavioral and Social Science; Bioengineering; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease; Prevention; Rehabilitation; Rural Health; Social Determinants of Health
Leveraging social networks to improve sleep and mindfulness among older adults in low-income housing,Leveraging social networks to improve sleep and mindfulness among older adults in low-income housing,"Poor sleep health (e.g., insufficient sleep duration, fragmented sleep, untreated sleep disorders) is associated
with increased risk of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Poor sleep health also increases soluble Amyloid βeta and
tau concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid suggesting a potential mechanism for sleep disturbance to promote
AD pathogenesis. All of these could increase the risk for AD, meaning that poor sleep health and untreated
sleep disorders are potential catalysts for AD risk, and that improving sleep may be a modifiable target for AD
prevention among older adults. Sleep difficulties remain unaddressed among many older adults, especially
those in low resource settings, such as among residents of low-income housing facilities. Our team (the Sleep
Matters Initiative) has an established, effective Sleep Health and Wellness (SHAW) program, comprised of
sleep and sleep disorders education. We propose to expand the SHAW program to include mindfulness, the
Eastern practice of focused concertation in the present moment, which has been shown to improve sleep,
reduce stress, and strengthen cognitive function in older adults. Guided by User Centered Design, we will
conduct iterative stages of feedback from older adults and prototyping, that will ensure the sleep and
mindfulness messages and materials are accessible, usable, and feasible for cognitively unimpaired older
adults (age 55 years and above) in low-income housing in Boston. Given that networks of trusted other seniors
are essential sources of information and influence, we propose a novel social network approach, that will
identify opinion leaders in low-income housing facilities and engage these individuals as Sleep Health
Champions (SHCs) to aid in diffusing the adapted SHAW materials and resources through interpersonal
communication and small group sessions. Our objective in this R34 is to culturally adapt the SHAW and
mindfulness modules to the needs of cognitively unimpaired older adults in low-income housing facilities, then
conduct a feasibility and acceptability pilot study of the proposed social network approach to deliver the
adapted SHAW program to cognitively unimpaired older adults in low-income housing in Boston with the aim of
improving sleep, quality of life (QoL), and cognitive function. We will conduct the proposed planning activities
and feasibility study in close collaboration with our longtime partner, the City of Boston Age Strong
Commission. The culturally adapted SHAW and mindfulness program will be evaluated in a planned cluster
randomized controlled trial in cognitively unimpaired seniors in low-income housing in Boston on sleep health
behaviors, QoL, and cognitive function in a planned R01 that will be submitted in Year 3 of this award. It is
hypothesized that exposure to the adapted, SHC-deployed SHAW and mindfulness intervention in the planned
R01 will be associated with improved sleep, QoL, and markers of cognitive decline.","<AD dementia><AD prevention><Age><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer disease prevention><Alzheimer prevention><Alzheimer risk factor><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimer's disease risk><Alzheimers Dementia><Amyloid><Amyloid Substance><Award><Back><Boston><Cerebrospinal Fluid><Characteristics><Cities><Cognition><Cognitive><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Collaborations><Communication><Critiques><Data><Diffuse><Diffusion><Disturbance in cognition><Dorsum><Education><Educational aspects><Educational process of instructing><Ensure><Evaluation><Exposure to><Feasibility Studies><Feedback><Goals><Health behavior><Housing><Impaired cognition><Individual><Instruction><Interpersonal Communication><Interview><Investigators><Leadership><Length><Low income><Low-resource area><Low-resource community><Low-resource environment><Low-resource region><Low-resource setting><MT-bound tau><Pathogenesis><Personal Communication><Pilot Projects><Polysomnography><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Protocol><Protocols documentation><QOL><Qualifying><Quality of life><Randomized, Controlled Trials><Research><Research Design><Research Personnel><Research Resources><Researchers><Resource-constrained area><Resource-constrained community><Resource-constrained environment><Resource-constrained region><Resource-constrained setting><Resource-limited area><Resource-limited community><Resource-limited environment><Resource-limited region><Resource-limited setting><Resource-poor area><Resource-poor community><Resource-poor environment><Resource-poor region><Resource-poor setting><Resources><Sleep><Sleep Deprivation><Sleep Disorders><Sleep Fragmentations><Sleep Monitoring><Sleep disturbances><Social Network><Somnography><Source><Study Type><Survey Instrument><Surveys><System><Teaching><Testing><Thinking><Time><Trainers Training><Training><Trust><Wellness Program><aberrant sleep><acceptability and feasibility><ages><alzheimer risk><behavior change><behavioral health><catalyst><cerebral spinal fluid><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive function><cognitive loss><cohesion><deficient sleep><design><designing><diffused><diffuses><diffusing><diffusions><disrupted sleep><disturbed sleep><experience><health related behavior><impaired sleep><improvement on sleep><inadequate sleep><instructor><insufficient sleep><interventions leveraging social networks><irregular sleep><member><microtubule bound tau><microtubule-bound tau><mindfulness><mindfulness intervention><mindfulness-based intervention><multidisciplinary><novel><older adult><older adulthood><pilot study><pilot test><polysomnographic><poor sleep><primary degenerative dementia><programs><prototype><randomized control trial><recruit><residence><residential building><residential site><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><sleep debt><sleep deficiency><sleep deficit><sleep difficulty><sleep diseases><sleep disruption><sleep dysfunction><sleep dysregulation><sleep health><sleep hygiene><sleep illness><sleep improvement><sleep insufficiency><sleep loss><sleep measurement><sleep polysomnography><sleep problem><social><social network based intervention><social network intervention><spinal fluid><stress reduction><study design><tau><tau Proteins><tau factor><thoughts><usability><user centered design><wearable><wearable device><wearable electronics><wearable system><wearable technology><wearable tool><wearables><τ Proteins>",Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Complementary and Integrative Health; Dementia; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Prevention; Sleep Research; Social Determinants of Health
Informatics-enhanced Social Networks and Affiliation Processes (ISNAP) to promote risk reduction and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's and Related Dementias.,Informatics-enhanced Social Networks and Affiliation Processes (ISNAP) to promote risk reduction and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's and Related Dementias.,"Abstract:
 Modification of risky health behaviors to improve brain health and early detection of the disease are
pivotal components to alleviate the societal burden of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD).
Both these components are heavily influenced by individuals' in-person and online social ties. Social media has
become predominant as a source of information for many individuals as they seek health-related information and
care. However, our understanding of the ways through which we can effectively harness these social
mechanisms to support individuals' care-seeking behaviors and behavior change efforts is quite limited. In the
proposed research, we will seek to develop a methodological framework that enables us to (a) examine
individual- and group-level dynamics associated with information-seeking and care-seeking behaviors in in-
person and digital contexts for risk reduction and early detection of ADRD, and (b) model population-level
network diffusion characteristics and their relationship with individuals' behavioral state/stage, resistance to
misinformation, manifestation of sociobehavioral processes. Grounded in theories of human behavior, cognitive
psychology, and network sciences, we will employ mixed-methods approach to analyze social dynamics using
data collected through surveys and interviews in in-person settings and ADRD-related peer interactions in online
social media platforms. Specifically, we will employ theories (e.g., Integrated Behaviora Model, Transtheoretical
Model of Change, Case seeking delay model) and methods that facilitate granular (e.g., grounded theory
analysis), high-throughput (e.g., natural language processing, deep learning), and collective (e.g., ego-centered
networks, affiliation networks) modeling of information seeking and care seeking behaviors as self-reported in
surveys and as manifested in online social media. While generally applicable, the methods will be developed
based on communications among individuals engaging in social intercourse related to risk reduction and early
detection of ADRD. This research proposal will result in 1) novel methods to incorporate behavioral/care seeking
stages and processes into network models of social influence and 2) new proposals for the development of
network interventions that harness social ties and behavioral constructs to support individuals engaging in
modification of risky health behaviors and care seeking behaviors within and beyond ADRD domain.",<21+ years old><65 and older><65 or older><65 years of age and older><65 years of age or more><65 years of age or older><65+ years><65+ years old><> 65 years><AD related dementia><ADRD><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><Aged 65 and Over><Alzheimer's and related dementias><Alzheimer's disease and related dementia><Alzheimer's disease and related disorders><Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia><Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder><Alzheimer's disease or related dementia><Alzheimer's disease related dementia><Archives><Attitude><Avitaminosis><Behavior><Behavior Conditioning Therapy><Behavior Modification><Behavior Therapy><Behavior Treatment><Behavioral><Behavioral Conditioning Therapy><Behavioral Modification><Behavioral Therapy><Behavioral Treatment><Bleeding><Caring><Causality><Characteristics><Chronic Disease><Chronic Illness><Code><Coding System><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive Science><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Communicable Diseases><Communication><Communities><Computer Assisted><Conditioning Therapy><Consultations><Data><Data Analyses><Data Analysis><Data Science><Death Rate><Delirium><Detection><Development><Diagnosis><Diffusion><Disease><Disorder><Disturbance in cognition><Early Diagnosis><Ego><Etiology><Family member><Goals><Guidelines><Health><Health Care Providers><Health Care Seeking Behavior><Health Personnel><Health Promotion><Health behavior><Healthcare Providers><Healthcare worker><Hemorrhage><Human><Impaired cognition><Individual><Infectious Disease Pathway><Infectious Diseases><Infectious Disorder><Informatics><Information Resources><Interpersonal Interaction><Interpersonal Relations><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Interview><Knowledge><Lifestyle Risk Reduction><Link><Major Depressive Disorder><Manuals><Maps><Measures><Methodology><Methods><Misinformation><Modeling><Modern Man><Modification><Natural Language Processing><Nature><Network Analysis><Parents><Pathology><Pathway Analysis><Pathway interactions><Patient Care><Patient Care Delivery><Patient Self-Report><Patients><Persons><Physical activity><Play><Population><Process><Public Health><Research><Research Methodology><Research Methods><Research Proposals><Resistance><Risk><Risk Behaviors><Risk Reduction><Risk Reduction Behavior><Risky Behavior><Role><Salutogenesis><Science><Self-Report><Services><Shapes><Social Behavior><Social Network><Social Processes><Source><Structure><Survey Instrument><Surveys><Symptoms><Texas><Theoretic Models><Theoretical model><United States><Vitamin Deficiency><Vitamin Deficiency Disorder><Work><above age 65><adulthood><after age 65><age 65 and greater><age 65 and older><age 65 or older><age > 65><age of 65 years onward><aged 65 and greater><aged 65+><aged ≥65><at risk behavior><behavior change><behavior construct><behavior influence><behavior intervention><behavioral construct><behavioral influence><behavioral intervention><blood loss><brain health><care for patients><care of patients><care providers><care seeking><caring for patients><causation><chronic disorder><clinical depression><co-morbid><co-morbidity><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive loss><cognitive psychology><comorbidity><computer aided><consultation><data interpretation><deep learning><deep learning method><deep learning strategy><delirious><density><developmental><diabetes management><diabetes mellitus management><diabetic management><diffused><diffuses><diffusing><diffusions><digital><digital communication><digital platform><disease causation><early detection><experience><health care personnel><health care worker><health provider><health related behavior><health workforce><healthcare personnel><healthcare seeking behavior><human old age (65+)><hypovitaminosis><improved><information model><information resource><information seeking behavior><insight><interpersonal relationship><interventional strategy><knowledge resource><knowledge resources><life-style risk reduction><major depression><major depression disorder><medical personnel><mid life><mid-life><middle age><middle aged><midlife><mortality rate><mortality ratio><natural language understanding><network models><novel><old age><on-line community><online community><over 65 years><parent><pathway><peer><peer influence><pressure><promoting health><quality of sleep><reduce risk><reduce risks><reduce that risk><reduce the risk><reduce these risks><reduces risk><reduces the risk><reducing risk><reducing the risk><research and methods><resistant><risk-reducing><self reported behavior><sleep quality><social><social capital><social influence><social media><social norm><social relationships><social role><social structural><social structure><socio-structural><sociobehavior><sociobehavioral><sociostructural><theories><treatment provider><virtual community><≥65 years>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment;

"Feasibility, Acceptability, and Pilot Testing of a Behavioral Intervention for Chronic Migraine","Feasibility, Acceptability, and Pilot Testing of a Behavioral Intervention for Chronic Migraine","Project Summary: This K01 NINDS Award will provide Dr. Yohannes Woldeamanuel with intensive, supervised
training to help him become an independent research scientist focusing on headache medicine, more specifically
on managing migraine using health-promoting lifestyle behaviors (e.g. regular exercise). Using this K01 Award,
Dr. Woldeamanuel will get the support necessary to complete the following goals: (a) become skilled in clinical
trials involving behavioral interventions to manage migraine, (b) train in statistical and bioinformatics methods,
(c) to gain proficiency in mass spectrometry, assays, and quantification, (d) develop activities and scholarship
aimed at career development goals to become an independent investigator. To achieve these goals, Dr.
Woldeamanuel has assembled a team of mentors: Drs. Robert Cowan (Primary Mentor), Oxana Palesh (Co-
Mentor), Jamie Zeitzer (Co-Mentor), Michael Snyder (Co-Mentor), Ying Lu (Advisor), Allis Chien (Advisor).
Research: Increasingly, migraine patients prefer non-drug treatment options and often discontinue drug
treatment due to adverse effects, poor compliance, and cost issues. Currently, there is no direct evidence
demonstrating the utility of regular lifestyle behavior (RLB i.e. regular sleep, exercise, mealtime) to manage
chronic migraine. This proposal is the first to conduct a feasibility and pilot testing study of RLB in managing
chronic migraine using the following specific aims. Primary Aim: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of
RLB in chronic migraine patients. Secondary Aim: To examine the preliminary efficacy of RLB in managing
chronic migraine as measured by reduction in monthly migraine days. Mechanistic Exploratory Aim: To examine
candidate biomarkers that predict chronic migraine patients who are RLB-responders. The development, pilot
testing, and validation RLB-based migraine therapy will have a positive impact in the headache field by providing
a framework for development of efficacious lifestyle-based self-management protocols. By demonstrating it to
be equipotent to daily medications, lifestyle medicine can have the added value of obviating medication risks
and unwanted side-effects common among chronic migraine sufferers. The proposed research is innovative
because its successful completion will pilot test a novel method by utilizing RLB as a self-management tool in
managing migraine. In addition, this proposed research will use multi-omics to elucidate underlying biological
mechanisms of RLB therapy. Application of system biology technology will create a paradigm shift from current
headache research concentrating on single molecule. This approach will be the first of its kind in the headache
field in providing proof-of-principle that personalized lifestyle-based protocols can be used to manage migraine.
This research will form the basis for an R01 application of a full-scale clinical trial before the end of the K award.","<Adverse effects><Assay><Attention><Attenuated><Award><Behavior><Behavior Conditioning Therapy><Behavior Modification><Behavior Therapy><Behavior Treatment><Behavioral Conditioning Therapy><Behavioral Modification><Behavioral Therapy><Behavioral Treatment><Bio-Informatics><Bioassay><Bioinformatics><Biological><Biological Assay><Blood Serum><CD44 Adhesion Receptor><CD44 Antigens><CD44 molecule><Career Development Awards><Career Development Awards and Programs><Career Development Programs K-Series><Cephalalgia><Cephalgia><Cephalodynia><Chronic><Clinical><Clinical Trials><CoA><Coenzyme A><Conditioning Therapy><Cranial Pain><Cross Sectional Analysis><Cross-Sectional Analyses><Cross-Sectional Studies><Cross-Sectional Survey><Development><Disease Frequency Surveys><Disease Management><Disorder Management><Drug Therapy><Drugs><Endowment><Exercise><Frequencies><Future><Glutathione><Goals><HUTCH-1><Head Pain><Headache><Health Promotion><Hermes Antigen><Hyaluronan Receptors><Hyaluronan-Binding Protein><Hyaluronic Acid Binding Protein><Informal Social Control><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Intervention Studies><Investigators><K-Awards><K-Series Research Career Programs><K01 Award><K01 Mechanism><K01 Program><Life Style><Lifestyle><Lifestyle Therapy><Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis><Mass Spectrometry><Mass Spectroscopy><Mass Spectrum><Mass Spectrum Analyses><Mass Spectrum Analysis><Measures><Medication><Medicine><Mentored Research Scientist Development Award><Mentored Training Award><Mentors><Methods><Migraine><Migraine Headache><NINDS><National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke><National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke><Nerve Impulse Transmission><Nerve Transmission><Neuronal Transmission><Non-pharmacologic Therapy><Nonpharmacologic Intervention><Nonpharmacologic Therapy><Nonpharmacologic approach><Nonpharmacologic treatment><Outcome><Oxidative Stress><Participant><Patients><Perception><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Pharmacotherapy><Phenotype><Pilot Projects><Placebo Control><Proteomics><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Provider><Randomized><Randomized, Controlled Trials><Recommendation><Regimen><Research><Research Career Program><Research Design><Research Personnel><Research Scientist Development Award><Researchers><Risk><Role><Salutogenesis><Scholarship><Scientist><Self Efficacy><Self Management><Self Regulation><Serum><Severities><Sleep><Study Type><Systems Biology><Technology><Testing><Training><Validation><Vascular Permeabilities><acceptability and feasibility><adherence rate><allostatic load><arm><attenuate><attenuates><axon signaling><axon-glial signaling><axonal signaling><base><bases><behavior adherence><behavior intervention><behavioral adherence><behavioral clinical trial><behavioral intervention><biobehavior><biobehavioral><biologic><candidate biomarker><candidate marker><care as usual><career development><co-morbid depression><co-morbid with depression><co-morbidity with depression><cognitive control><comorbid depression><comorbid with depression><comorbidity with depression><compare to control><comparison control><compliance behavior><coping><cost><depression co-morbidity><depression comorbidity><design><designing><developmental><drug adherence><drug compliance><drug treatment><drug/agent><efficacy testing><empowerment><feasibility testing><gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly><gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine><glia signaling><glial signaling><gp85><head ache><innovate><innovation><innovative><intervention research><interventional research><interventional strategy><interventional study><interventions research><medication adherence><medication compliance><metabolism measurement><metabolomics><metabonomics><migraine therapy><migraine treatment><multiomics><multiple omics><nerve signaling><neural inflammation><neural signaling><neuroinflammation><neuroinflammatory><neuronal signaling><neurotransmission><non-drug><non-drug therapy><non-drug treatment><nondrug><nondrug therapy><nondrug treatment><novel><panomics><participant engagement><patient engagement><pilot study><pilot test><placebo controlled><predictive biomarkers><predictive marker><predictive molecular biomarker><prevent><preventing><promoting health><prospective><randomisation><randomization><randomized control trial><randomly assigned><recruit><satisfaction><side effect><single molecule><skills><social role><study design><tool><treatment as usual><usual care><validations>",Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Chronic Pain; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Complementary and Integrative Health; Headaches; Migraine; Neurosciences; Pain Research; Prevention
Night- to-Night Variability in Sleep Disordered Breathing: Sex and Gender-Related Predictors and Impact on Obstructive Sleep Apnea Clinical Heterogeneity,Night- to-Night Variability in Sleep Disordered Breathing: Sex and Gender-Related Predictors and Impact on Obstructive Sleep Apnea Clinical Heterogeneity,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The current standard measure of OSA, the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) underestimates women’s OSA
severity compared to men, which may lead to missed diagnoses, thus increasing women’s risk for
cardiovascular disease, metabolic and mood disorders, and poor daytime functioning. Most of the early
evidence to support the use of AHI as a measure of OSA severity has been validated in men. There is a
pressing need to identify a reliable biomarker of OSA severity in order to minimize sex and gender inequities in
in diagnosis and management of OSA. We propose to assess night-to-night variability in novel OSA severity
metrics and assess their impact on day-to-day sleepiness, fatigue, mood, and stress towards characterization
of reliable biomarkers of disease severity. The proposed study will leverage cutting-edge sleep monitoring
technology (Cerebra Sleep System) supporting the data collection in the participant’s home over 7 nights. The
study will also collect daytime functioning information several times per day via ecological momentary
assessments (EMA). We will enroll participants from two Sleep Medicine Centers associated with the
University of Pittsburgh and the University of Kansas Medical Center which will allow for a robust recruitment of
300 participants, 100 men, and 200 women balanced by menopausal status. Using available multiple night
recordings, we will assess the within- and between-subject variability of key sleep-disordered breathing
physiological traits (total and sleep stage-specific AHI, hypoxic burden, and pulse rate responses to respiratory
events and to arousals) and determine the role of sex as a potential contributor of between-subject variability in
these traits (Aim 1). Next, we will assess the temporal relationship between novel OSA severity parameters,
sleep traits and daytime function using key objective (sleep duration, architecture, depth, microstructure) and
self-reported sleep traits, as well as EMA of daytime sleepiness, fatigue, mood, and stress (Aim 2). We will
assess the temporal effects of OSA severity parameters on daytime function, determine whether these effects
are mediated by objective sleep traits, and establish whether sex and gender moderate these associations.
Our central hypothesis is that men and women require distinct definitions of OSA severity, because the
mechanisms explaining how sleep disordered breathing impact daytime functioning will be different between
sexes. This study has the potential to create a new paradigm in OSA research that will lead to novel
approaches to OSA severity definitions and improve long term health outcomes for women and men.","<Affect><Affective Disorders><Age><Apnea><Architecture><Arousal><Attitude><Behavior><Biological Markers><Clinical><Data Collection><Diagnosis><Differences between sexes><Differs between sexes><Dimensions><Disease><Disorder><Disparities><Disparity><Drowsiness><Dysfunction><Ecological momentary assessment><Engineering / Architecture><Enrollment><Event><Exclusion><Fatigue><Functional disorder><Gender><Goals><Guidelines><Health><Home><Hypoxia><Hypoxic><Impairment><Individual><Inequity><Kansas><Lack of Energy><Life><Literature><Long-Term Care><Measures><Mediating><Medical center><Medicine><Menopausal Status><Metabolic Diseases><Metabolic Disorder><Mood Disorders><Moods><Obstructive Sleep Apnea><Outcome><Oxygen Deficiency><Participant><Patient Self-Report><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiopathology><Polysomnography><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Pulse Rates><Research><Respiratory physiology><Role><Sampling><Self-Report><Severities><Severity of illness><Sex Differences><Sexual differences><Sleep><Sleep Apnea><Sleep Apnea Syndromes><Sleep Architecture><Sleep Hypopnea><Sleep Monitoring><Sleep Stages><Sleep-Disordered Breathing><Somnography><Somnolence><Source><Stress><Structure><Symptoms><Syndrome, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive><System><Technology><Testing><Thesaurismosis><Universities><Woman><accurate diagnosis><ages><bio-markers><biologic marker><biomarker><cardiovascular disease risk><cardiovascular disorder risk><clinical heterogeneity><disease heterogeneity><disease severity><disparities in sex><effective therapy><effective treatment><enroll><evidence base><expectation><extended care><female outcomes><gender disparity><homes><improved><indexing><longterm care><male><men><metabolism disorder><new approaches><new marker><novel><novel approaches><novel biomarker><novel marker><novel strategies><novel strategy><outcomes among females><outcomes among women><outcomes in females><outcomes in women><participant enrollment><pathophysiology><patient enrollment><polysomnographic><recruit><research study><respiratory><respiratory function><response><sex><sex based differences><sex disparity><sex-dependent differences><sex-related differences><sex-specific differences><sleep measurement><sleep physiology><sleep polysomnography><sleep-related breathing disorder><sleepiness><social culture><social role><socio-cultural><sociocultural><standard measure><trait><women's outcomes>",Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Lung; Sleep Research; Women's Health Research
"Natural History of Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency (SSADHD), a Heritable Disorder of GABA Metabolism","Natural History of Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency (SSADHD), a Heritable Disorder of GABA Metabolism","SUMMARY – Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADHD) is a rare genetic disease caused by
impaired γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission. Since SSADHD was first identified in 1983, research
has focused on identifying the spectrum of pathogenic ALDH5A1 mutations, understanding the molecular and
biochemical bases of disease presentation, and testing promising therapeutics. To date, however, there remain
significant knowledge gaps that are barriers to early detection and prognosis of the disease, and to the
assessment of the efficacy of novel promising therapeutics. These gaps include a comprehensive description of
the natural course of the clinical severity of the disease, an in-depth assessment of the neurophysiology of the
disease, and the prognostic value of biochemical markers. We began to address these knowledge gaps four
years ago with our currently funded natural history study (NHS) of SSADHD and have already demonstrated
significant correlations between age of the patients, severity of the disease, blood biomarkers, and
neurophysiological parameters. However, the 4-5 year span of the current study and varying age and clinical
severity of the study participants has mostly afforded a cross-sectional perspective on disease progression and
the prognostic value of biomarkers. In order to gain the longitudinal insight needed to assess the predictive power
of disease markers at study intake on prognosis, a longer follow-up of the participants is needed. The purpose
of this application is to extend this natural history study for five years. We propose the following aims: 1) to
determine patient-specific changes over time in the clinical severity of SSADHD, 2) to determine patient-specific
changes over time in neurophysiological markers known to be dependent on GABA homeostasis, and 3) to
determine patient-specific changes over time in biochemical markers known to be abnormal in SSADHD. To
accomplish these aims, the study will follow ~70 patients representing ~30% of all known cases worldwide. The
project will be led by research teams at three academic institutions and is supported by patient advocacy groups
and families from all over the world. The research will provide the clinical and biochemical information needed
to predict the natural course of the disease, monitor the success of future therapeutic trials, and provide a strong
rationale for adding SSADHD screening to existing NBS panels.","<21+ years old><4-Aminobutanoic Acid><4-Aminobutyric Acid><4-Hydroxybutyric aciduria><4-amino-butanoic acid><Active Follow-up><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Age><Aminalon><Aminalone><Autoregulation><Biochemical><Biochemical Markers><Biological Markers><Blood><Blood Plasma><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Boston><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cerebrovascular Circulation><Children's Hospital><Clinical><Clinical Data><Clinical Trials><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Cohort Studies><Collection><Communication Disorders><Communication impairment><Communicative Disorders><Concurrent Studies><Control Groups><Data><Data Analyses><Data Analysis><Development><Diagnostic><Disease><Disease Marker><Disease Progression><Disorder><Disturbance in cognition><Early Diagnosis><Encephalon><Enrollment><Epilepsy><Epileptic Seizures><Epileptics><Evaluation><Family><Foundations><Functional MRI><Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Funding><Future><GABA><GABA metabolic defect><GABAuria><Gamma-hydroxybutyric acidemia><Genes><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic Diseases><Genetic defect><Germany><Hereditary Disease><Homeostasis><Impaired cognition><Impairment><Inborn Genetic Diseases><Individual><Inherited disorder><Institution><Intake><Intermediary Metabolism><International><Knowledge><Laboratories><MR Spectroscopy><Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy><Measurement><Measures><Messenger RNA><Metabolic><Metabolic Diseases><Metabolic Disorder><Metabolic Processes><Metabolism><Methods><Molecular><Monitor><Motor><Mutation><Natural History><Neonatal Screening><Nerve Impulse Transmission><Nerve Transmission><Nerve Transmitter Substances><Neurologic><Neurological><Neuronal Transmission><Neuropsychologies><Neuropsychology><Neurotransmitters><Newborn Infant Screening><Norway><Older Population><Orphan Disease><Participant><Pathogenicity><Patients><Pediatric Hospitals><Physiological Homeostasis><Plasma><Plasma Serum><Prognosis><Rare Diseases><Rare Disorder><Research><Research Design><Rest><Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma><Seizure Disorder><Seizures><Severities><Severity of illness><Site><Spain><Specialist><Standardization><Statistical Data Analyses><Statistical Data Analysis><Statistical Data Interpretation><Study Type><Succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency><Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency><Teen><Teenagers><Testing><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Trials><Thesaurismosis><Time><Transcranial magnetic stimulation><Urine><Validation><Visit><active followup><adulthood><age associated alterations><age associated changes><age correlated alterations><age correlated changes><age dependent alterations><age dependent changes><age related alterations><age related changes><age specific alterations><age specific changes><ages><alterations with age><axon signaling><axon-glial signaling><axonal signaling><base><bases><behavioral impairment><bio-markers><biologic marker><biomarker><blood flow in brain><brain blood circulation><brain blood flow><cerebral blood flow><cerebral circulation><cerebrocirculation><cerebrovascular blood flow><changes with age><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive loss><data interpretation><determine efficacy><developmental><disease prognosis><disease prognostication><disease severity><early detection><efficacy analysis><efficacy assessment><efficacy determination><efficacy evaluation><efficacy examination><enroll><epilepsia><epileptogenic><evaluate efficacy><examine efficacy><fMRI><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><gamma-Aminobutyric Acid><gamma-Hydroxybutyric aciduria><genetic condition><genetic disorder><genome mutation><glia signaling><glial signaling><hereditary disorder><heritable disorder><impaired behavior><improved><inborn error><indexing><inherited diseases><inherited genetic disease><inherited genetic disorder><insight><mRNA><metabolism disorder><motor impairment><movement impairment><movement limitation><nerve signaling><neural signaling><neuronal signaling><neurophysiological><neurophysiology><neuropsychologic><neurotransmission><newborn screening><novel><older groups><older individuals><older person><orphan disorder><participant enrollment><patient advocacy group><patient enrollment><prognostic ability><prognostic power><prognostic utility><prognostic value><rare genetic disease><rare genetic disorder><recruit><screening><screening panel><screenings><sex><sleep control><sleep regulation><standard of care><statistical analysis><study design><success><teen years><teenage><tool><validations><work group><working group><γ-Aminobutyric Acid><γ-hydroxybutyrate>",Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Genetics; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD); Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Prevention; Rare Diseases
BMAL1 Circadian Clock Complexes from Mammalian Brain,BMAL1 Circadian Clock Complexes from Mammalian Brain,"Project Summary
 The circadian clock is an endogenous ~24-hour oscillator that drives daily rhythms of biological
processes. In mammals, circadian clocks are found in the brain and peripheral tissues. Together, the
distributed clocks constitute the basic timing system regulating behavior, physiology, and metabolism.
 The mammalian circadian clock is built on a transcriptional negative feedback loop that generates
circadian rhythms at the molecular level. The transcription factor BMAL1 is at the heart of this feedback
loop, acting as the positive element activating circadian clock transcription. Long-standing evidence
suggests that peripheral clocks and brain clocks differ with respect to BMAL1. In the periphery, BMAL1
transcriptional action (and clock function) requires the heterodimeric partner CLOCK, whereas in the brain
either CLOCK or NPAS2, a protein related to CLOCK, suffices to sustain the role of BMAL1 in clock
function. Circadian clocks in the brain thus possess a redundancy not found in peripheral clocks.
 We recently developed procedures for purifying native BMAL1 activator complexes from bovine
cerebral cortex, making large-scale purification for biochemical and structural studies of brain circadian
clock complexes practical. We find that BMAL1 activator complexes from brain are exclusively ~750 kDa
in mass, much larger than a free heterodimer and similar to what we previously observed in the periphery.
The complexes can be purified into two populations, one including BMAL1 and CLOCK (as in the
periphery), the other BMAL1 and NPAS2 (not found in the periphery). Electron microscopy revealed the
complexes to be discreet particles of ~20 nm in diameter, consistent with the estimated mass.
 The composition of these complexes is unknown; as expected of activator complexes, they do not
appear to include circadian negative feedback proteins. Their mass is sufficient for roughly 10-12 proteins
of average size. The full molecular identity and structure of the circadian clock transcriptional activators
are thus not yet known, a fundamental gap in our understanding. The goal of this application is to analyze
the composition of the two BMAL1 complexes purified from brain and develop procedures for determining
their three-dimensional structures by cryo-electron microscopy. If successful, the project offers to deepen
our knowledge of circadian clock transcription, provide potential new drug targets for circadian
therapeutics, and reveal differences between brain and peripheral clocks.
 Advances in understanding the circadian clock are important for our knowledge of behavior and
physiology, as well as for human health and disease. Clock defects produce disrupted sleep-wake cycles,
metabolic syndrome, and increased cancer incidence and are linked to bipolar disorder. The proposed
investigation aims to provide fundamental insights into the biological timing system essential for health.",<2-dimensional><3-D><3-D modeling><3-D structure><3-Dimensional><3-dimensional structure><3D><3D modeling><3D structure><ARNTL><ARNTL gene><Affective Disorders><BMAL1><Basal Transcription Factor><Basal transcription factor genes><Behavior><Biochemical><Biologic Oscillator><Biologic Pacemakers><Biological><Biological Function><Biological Oscillators><Biological Pacemakers><Biological Process><Biological Rhythm><Bipolar Affective Psychosis><Bipolar Disorder><Body Tissues><Bovine Species><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cancers><Cattle><Cell Body><Cells><Cerebral cortex><Circadian Rhythms><Collaborations><Complex><Cryo-electron Microscopy><Cryoelectron Microscopy><DNA Binding><DNA Binding Domain><DNA Binding Interaction><DNA bound><DNA-Binding Protein Motifs><Defect><Diabetes Mellitus><Diagnosis><Diameter><Disease><Disorder><Electron Cryomicroscopy><Electron Microscopy><Elements><Encephalon><Endogenous Oscillators><Feedback><Feeding behaviors><Freezing><Gene Transcription><General Transcription Factor Gene><General Transcription Factors><Genetic Transcription><Goals><Health><Health Hazards><Heart><Hour><Human><Incidence><Ingestive Behavior><Intermediary Metabolism><Investigation><Knowledge><Laboratories><Letters><Link><Macromolecular Protein Complexes><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Mammalia><Mammals><Manic-Depressive Psychosis><Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis><Mass Spectrometry><Mass Spectroscopy><Mass Spectrum><Mass Spectrum Analyses><Mass Spectrum Analysis><Metabolic Processes><Metabolic syndrome><Metabolism><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Molecular><Mood Disorders><Multiprotein Complexes><Murine><Mus><Negative Staining><Nuclear Extract><Nyctohemeral Rhythm><Obesity><Peripheral><Physiology><Play><Population><Preparation><Procedures><Proteins><RNA Expression><Resolution><Role><Sampling><Sleep Disorders><Sleep Wake Cycle><Sleep disturbances><Source><Structure><System><Testing><Therapeutic><Tissues><Transcription><Transcription Activator><Transcription Coactivator><Transcription Factor Coactivator><Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene><Transcription factor genes><Transcriptional Activator><Transcriptional Activator/Coactivator><Transcriptional Coactivator><Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm><Work><aberrant sleep><adiposity><aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like><biologic><bipolar affective disorder><bipolar disease><bipolar illness><bipolar mood disorder><bovid><bovine><circadian><circadian clock><circadian pacemaker><circadian process><corpulence><cow><cryo-EM><cryoEM><cryogenic electron microscopy><daily biorhythm><diabetes><disrupted sleep><disturbed sleep><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><feeding-related behaviors><global health><impaired sleep><improved><in vivo><insight><irregular sleep><malignancy><manic depressive disorder><manic depressive illness><neoplasm/cancer><new drug target><new druggable target><new pharmacotherapy target><new therapeutic target><new therapy target><novel drug target><novel druggable target><novel pharmacotherapy target><novel therapeutic target><novel therapy target><nutrient intake activity><particle><preparations><protein complex><resolutions><screening><screenings><sleep control><sleep diseases><sleep disruption><sleep dysfunction><sleep dysregulation><sleep health><sleep hygiene><sleep illness><sleep problem><sleep regulation><social role><success><three dimensional><three dimensional structure><three-dimensional modeling><transcription co-activator><transcription factor><transcriptional co-activator><two-dimensional>,Neurosciences; Sleep Research
Commercialization of a Behavioral Digital Health Program for Individuals with Chronic Pain,Commercialization of a Behavioral Digital Health Program for Individuals with Chronic Pain,"2Morrow, Inc. CRP Grant Application – Project Summary:
Chronic pain affects roughly 1 in 5 adults. Managing chronic pain is complex, and the reality for most patients
is that living a life free of pain is unlikely. Over 50% of patients with chronic pain also experience depression or
anxiety, and medical providers often lack the time, training or resources to address these emotional challenges.
This can leave patients feeling uncared about and providers feeling frustrated. Despite national guidelines that
recommend incorporating scalable behavioral interventions when managing pain, there continues to be an
overreliance on addictive pain medications. Given the need for HEAL-aligned pain management options such
as behavioral-based treatments, 2Morrow set out to design, develop, and test a novel evidence-based digital
behavioral therapeutic for individuals living with chronic pain with FAST-TRACK SBIR HEAL grant funding (#1
R44 AT 11593) aimed at reducing the negative impact of pain on daily life with educational content, skill
development, pain awareness tools, and coaching. Our SBIR feasibility RCT study is nearing completion
(August 2024) and shows strong engagement, positive feedback, and a decrease in pain interference. Our
focus is now shifting to dissemination and commercialization. The landscape for digital therapeutics presents
unique challenges, notably in the realms of investment expectations and the absence of established payment
and commercialization models. This complexity is compounded by the fact that, typically, it takes about 17
years for evidence-based practices to gain widespread adoption in the medical community. To counter this
trend and expedite the integration of our digital therapeutic, we need to validate commercial traction. Thus we
are applying for this HEAL Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) Program: Embedded Entrepreneurs for
Small Businesses in Pain Management (SB1 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) that will fund the hiring of a Chief
Commercial Officer (CCO) to accelerate the dissemination and commercialization of this product by focusing
on partner development.
Specific Aim 1: Hire a fractional (50% effort) CCO or equivalent experienced professional. Specific Aim 2:
During the first 90 days, the CCO will review, validate, and update 2Morrow’s commercialization plan. To do
this they will meet with the 2Morrow team, and at least 10 stakeholders or industry experts to 1) understand the
landscape and current business models, 2) understand current options and workflow, and 3) validate/refine
2Morrow’s go-to-market strategy. Specific Aim 3: The CCO will execute the commercialization/partnership
plan with a focus on advancing a business development pipeline that leads to key milestones such as a signed
partnership agreement or strategic investment.",<21+ years old><Acceleration><Address><Adoption><Adult><Adult Human><Advisory Committees><Affect><Agreement><Analgesic Agents><Analgesic Drugs><Analgesic Preparation><Analgesics><Anodynes><Antinociceptive Agents><Antinociceptive Drugs><Anxiety><Anxiety Disorders><Applications Grants><Awareness><Behavior Conditioning Therapy><Behavior Modification><Behavior Therapy><Behavior Treatment><Behavioral><Behavioral Conditioning Therapy><Behavioral Modification><Behavioral Therapy><Behavioral Treatment><Businesses><Caring><Client><Clinical><Clinical Trials><Communities><Complex><Conditioning Therapy><Coping Skills><Country><Development><Drug Prescribing><Drug Prescriptions><Economic Burden><Education><Educational aspects><Emotional><Evidence based practice><Feedback><Feeling><Frustration><Funding><Goals><Grant><Grant Proposals><Guidelines><Health behavior><Healthcare><Individual><Industry><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Investments><Lead><Leadership><Licensing><Life><Marketing><Medical><Mental Depression><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Modeling><Pain><Pain Control><Pain Free><Pain Therapy><Pain interference><Pain management><Painful><Participant><Patients><Pb element><Persons><Phase><Position><Positioning Attribute><Process><Provider><Psychological Health><Randomized><Recommendation><Research Resources><Resources><Role><SBIR><Sales><Sleep><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Stress><System><Task Forces><Technology><Testing><Therapeutic><Time><Tobacco Consumption><Tobacco use><Traction><Training><Update><Weight><Wellness Program><Woman><adulthood><advisory team><anxiety reduction><behavior intervention><behavioral health><behavioral intervention><chronic pain><chronic pain control><chronic pain intervention><chronic pain management><chronic pain patient><chronic pain therapy><chronic pain treatment><commercialization><commercialization readiness><coping strategy><cost><depression><design><designing><developmental><digital><digital health><digital therapeutics><digital therapy><digital treatment><evidence base><expectation><experience><feasibility trial><feelings><healing><health care><health related behavior><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><innovate><innovation><innovative><interventional strategy><medication prescription><meeting><meetings><novel><opiate crisis><opioid crisis><opioid epidemic><pain killer><pain medication><pain reliever><pain treatment><painkiller><patient with chronic pain><payment><prescribed medication><programs><psychosocial><randomisation><randomization><randomly assigned><skill acquisition><skill development><social role><social stigma><stigma><timeline><tobacco product use><tool><treat chronic pain><trend><weights>,Behavioral and Social Science; Chronic Pain; Complementary and Integrative Health; Mental Health; Neurosciences; Pain Research; Prevention; Telehealth
Vulnerability of the ascending arousal network to alpha-synuclein pathology,Vulnerability of the ascending arousal network to alpha-synuclein pathology,"Cognitive fluctuations –termed “the Lewy Body Roller Coaster” by some families – are a debilitating symptom
of Lewy body disorders (LBD), an Alzheimer’s disease related disorder that includes Parkinson’s Disease
dementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies. These unpredictable cognitive changes often lead to the loss of
independence in patients that could otherwise function. They are characterized by dramatic changes in two key
domains: attention (ability to focus/think) and arousal (ability to stay alert/awake). Presence of fluctuations are
a key feature used to diagnose LBD. Despite this, a basic understanding of fluctuations is lacking.
Our long-term goal is to determine the underlying mechanisms responsible for cognitive fluctuations in LBD
such that targeted, effective treatments can be developed. Animal models allow induction of pathology in
restricted brain circuits, providing the opportunity to address key basic and translational questions regarding
the origin of variability in attention and arousal. In this proposal, we will use injection of the fibrillar form of
alpha-synuclein, the protein associated with LBD, into one hub of the brainstem ascending arousal network
which is highly affected in patients with this disease. We will use mouse models to test the overarching
hypothesis that alpha-synuclein differentially impacts large projecting neurons in the brainstem that orchestrate
brain-wide networks necessary for attention and maintenance of arousal. In Aim 1 we will evaluate which cells
are vulnerable to pathology. We will focus on one brainstem region, the Locus Coeruleus, which shows
pathology in almost all patients with LBD. We will count cells and use live imaging to directly track changes in
axons from this arousal hub. Then, in Aim 2 and 3 we will determine how alpha-synuclein inclusions affect
arousal and attention, respectively. In Aim 2 we will evaluate arousal using continuous EEG in the context of
time-of-day, as well as after exposure to novelty in the home cage. In Aim 3, we will evaluate cognitive
variability using a repeatable timing-task combined with pupillometry and imaging at the single-cell level.
This proposal uses a combination of translatable non-invasive techniques (EEG, pupillometry) with powerful
laboratory methods able to probe individual neuronal activity. The findings will help us better explain findings
seen in human patients. Understanding the processes occurring during cognitive fluctuations is key to
eventually developing treatment targets, including non-invasive neuromodulation of abnormal neuronal activity
and pharmacological modulation of identified neuronal populations.",<2-photon><AD related dementia><ADRD><Acute><Address><Adrenergic Receptor><Adrenoceptors><Affect><Alzheimer's and related dementias><Alzheimer's diagnosis><Alzheimer's disease and related dementia><Alzheimer's disease and related disorders><Alzheimer's disease diagnosis><Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia><Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder><Alzheimer's disease or related dementia><Alzheimer's disease related dementia><Amentia><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Arousal><Attention><Autopsy><Axon><Brain><Brain Diseases><Brain Disorders><Brain Nervous System><Brain Stem><Brainstem><Cell Body><Cell Count><Cell Nucleus><Cell Number><Cells><Cellular Morphology><Cephalic><Chronic><Cognition><Cognitive><Coma><Comatose><Cranial><Data><Dementia><Dementia with Lewy Bodies><Development><Diagnosis><Diagnostic><Disease><Disorder><Dorsal><Dose><EEG><Electrodes><Electroencephalogram><Electroencephalography><Encephalon><Encephalon Diseases><Epinephrine Receptors><Excessive Daytime Sleepiness><Excessive daytime somnolence><Exposure to><Family><Frequencies><Goals><Guanfacine><Head><Home><Hour><Human><Image><Impairment><Individual><Injections><Intracranial CNS Disorders><Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders><Knowledge><LB dementia><LB disease><LB disorder><Laboratories><Lesion><Lewy Bodies><Lewy Body Dementia><Lewy Body Disease><Lewy Body Type Senile Dementia><Lewy body disorder><Lewy dementia><Lewy disease><Lewy disorder><Literature><Locus Coeruleus><Maintenance><Measures><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Microdialysis><Modeling><Modern Man><Murine><Mus><NAC precursor><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neuromodulator><Neurons><Nucleus><Nucleus Pigmentosus Pontis><Outcome><PARK1 protein><PARK4 protein><PD with dementia><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Parkinson Disease dementia><Parkinson's Dementia><Parkinson's disease with dementia><Pathology><Patients><Persons><Population><Prefrontal Cortex><Primary Parkinsonism><Process><Proteins><Publishing><Research><SNCA><SNCA protein><Sleep><Sleep Architecture><Speed><Stimulus><Surrogate Markers><Symptoms><System><Techniques><Testing><Time><Toxin><Transgenic Organisms><United States><Ventral Tegmental Area><Wakefulness><Work><a-syn><a-synuclein><adenoreceptor><alpha synuclein><alpha synuclein gene><alphaSP22><asyn><awake><blue nucleus><cell morphology><circadian><cognitive change><debilitating symptom><dementia in PD><dementia in Parkinson disease><developmental><effective therapy><effective treatment><flexibility><flexible><high risk><homes><imaging><improved><in vivo><insight><locus ceruleus structure><model of animal><mouse model><murine model><necropsy><neural control><neural regulation><neuromodulation><neuromodulatory><neuronal><neuroregulation><neurotransmitter release><non A-beta component of AD amyloid><non A4 component of amyloid precursor><novel><overexpress><overexpression><parabrachial nucleus><pharmacologic><postmortem><pre-formed fibril><recruit><response><surrogate bio-markers><surrogate biomarkers><transgenic><two-photon><ventral tegmentum><vigilance><α synuclein gene><α-syn><α-synuclein>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD); Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Dementia; Lewy Body Dementia; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease
"Determining the Feasibility of Virtual Tailored, Music-Based Relaxation for Anxiety Among Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Survivors.","Determining the Feasibility of Virtual Tailored, Music-Based Relaxation for Anxiety Among Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Survivors.","Clinical Problem: Up to 48.5% of adolescent and young adult (AYA, 15 – 39 years old) cancer survivors
experience clinically relevant anxiety. Anxiety disrupts the successful achievement of normative developmental
tasks and is associated with fear of cancer recurrence and decreased quality of life. Cognitive behavioral
therapy is a guideline-based recommendation for anxiety, but only 40% of AYAs seek out such treatments, and
stigma regarding psychotherapy is high, particularly among individuals of diverse backgrounds.
Overall Objective: Music-based interventions offer an evidence-based treatment for anxiety in adults with
cancer. Despite the growth of studies, approximately 8% of trials have included AYA/pediatric cancer patients.
The overall objective is to determine the feasibility of conducting an eight-week, (45 min/week), virtually-
delivered, tailored music-based relaxation (TiMBRe) intervention to decrease anxiety in AYA cancer survivors.
TiMBRe uses tailored music experiences, delivered by a board-certified music therapist, to develop greater
self-awareness and use of music-based relaxation to increase self-efficacy to cope and manage anxiety.
Need for Planning Study: The primary aim of our future, phase II, multicenter randomized controlled trial is to
determine the efficacy of a virtual, TiMBRe intervention to reduce anxiety in AYA cancer survivors with
clinically relevant anxiety. Our preliminary data (N=37) demonstrate that the implementation of a four-session
(45 min each), virtual TiMBRe intervention for AYAs with cancer is feasible and well accepted by AYAs, with a
majority (13/21, [67%]) of AYAs with anxiety reporting clinically significant changes in their anxiety pre-to post-
intervention. However, we must first address several planning issues that will prepare the protocol for
successful implementation and completion in a randomized controlled trial.
R34 Specific Aims: The primary aim is to determine the feasibility of implementing a randomized controlled
trial of an eight-week, virtual, TiMBRe intervention in post-treatment AYA cancer survivors with clinically
relevant anxiety. Secondarily, we will determine the credibility of an attention control condition for virtual
TiMBRe and develop fidelity measures to ensure standardized delivery of virtual TiMBRe across therapists.
Methods: Using an explanatory-sequential mixed methods design, we will first randomize 50 AYA cancer
survivors with clinically relevant anxiety from the University of Michigan to the eight-week TiMBRe intervention
or attention-control (i.e., study staff calls + cancer survivorship resources). Participants will complete patient-
reported outcome measures (e.g., PROMIS Anxiety 4a) at baseline, four, eight, and twenty weeks. TiMBRe
group participants will participate in semi-structured interviews to evaluate intervention acceptability.
Expected Outcomes: The expected outcome is the demonstration that virtual TiMBRe intervention delivery is
feasible within a randomized-controlled trial, with further data supporting a credible attention control and
effective intervention fidelity methods. Results will inform a phase II efficacy trial.","<21+ years old><Achievement><Achievement Attainment><Active Follow-up><Address><Adherence><Adolescent and Young Adult><Adolescent and young adult cancer patients><Adolescent and young adult cancer population><Adolescent and young adult oncology patients><Adolescent and young adults with cancer><Adult><Adult Human><After Care><After-Treatment><Aftercare><Anxiety><Anxiety Disorders><Board Certification><Cancer Patient><Cancer Survivor><Cancer Survivorship><Cancer Treatment><Cancers><Childhood Cancers><Clinical><Cognition Therapy><Cognitive Psychotherapy><Cognitive Therapy><Cognitive treatment><Control Groups><Data><Development><Diagnosis><Distress><Dose><Eligibility><Eligibility Determination><Ensure><Evidence based treatment><Fatigue><Fear><Fright><Future><Generalized Growth><Growth><Guidelines><Healthcare><Individual><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Intervention Trial><Interventional trial><Interview><Knowledge><Lack of Energy><Malignant Childhood Neoplasm><Malignant Childhood Tumor><Malignant Neoplasm Therapy><Malignant Neoplasm Treatment><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm><Malignant Pediatric Tumor><Malignant Tumor><Malignant childhood cancer><Measures><Mental disorders><Mental health disorders><Methods><Michigan><Music><Music Intervention><Music Therapy><Outcome><Outcome Measure><Participant><Patient Outcomes Assessments><Patient Reported Measures><Patient Reported Outcomes><Personal awareness><Phase><Phase 2 Clinical Trials><Phase II Clinical Trials><Pilot Projects><Protocol><Protocol Screening><Protocols documentation><Psychiatric Disease><Psychiatric Disorder><Psychosocial Assessment and Care><Psychotherapy><Public Health><QOL><Quality of life><Randomized><Randomized, Controlled Trials><Recommendation><Recurrent Malignant Neoplasm><Recurrent Malignant Tumor><Relaxation><Reporting><Research><Research Resources><Resources><Schools><Self Efficacy><Self Perception><Self image><Self view><Sleep Disorders><Specificity><Standardization><Structure><Testing><Tissue Growth><Treatment Efficacy><Universities><Work><active followup><adulthood><anti-cancer therapy><anxiety management><anxiety reduction><anxiety treatment><arm><attentional control><cancer among adolescent and young adults><cancer in a child><cancer in children><cancer initiation><cancer recurrence><cancer therapy><cancer-directed therapy><child with cancer><childhood malignancy><clinical relevance><clinical significance><clinically relevant><clinically significant><cognitive behavior intervention><cognitive behavior modification><cognitive behavior therapy><cognitive behavioral intervention><cognitive behavioral modification><cognitive behavioral therapy><cognitive behavioral treatment><comparator group><comparison group><coping><delivered virtually><design><designing><determine efficacy><developmental><effective intervention><efficacy analysis><efficacy assessment><efficacy determination><efficacy evaluation><efficacy examination><efficacy trial><evaluate efficacy><examine efficacy><experience><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><health care><improved><intervention delivery><intervention efficacy><interventional strategy><malignancy><measurable outcome><mental illness><neoplasm/cancer><ontogeny><outcome measurement><pediatric cancer><pediatric malignancy><phase 2 trial><phase II protocol><phase II trial><pilot study><post intervention><post treatment><psychiatric illness><psychological disorder><psychosocial><psychosocial assessment><psychosocial care><psychosocial studies><psychosocial support><quality assurance><randomisation><randomization><randomized control trial><randomly assigned><recruit><self awareness><self knowledge><side effect><sleep diseases><sleep dysfunction><sleep illness><sleep problem><social media><social stigma><stigma><theories><therapeutic efficacy><therapy efficacy><virtual><virtual delivery>",Anxiety Disorders; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Complementary and Integrative Health; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Pediatric; Pediatric Cancer; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Rehabilitation
Novel Statistical Models for Intensive Longitudinal Analyses of Cancer Control Behaviors,Novel Statistical Models for Intensive Longitudinal Analyses of Cancer Control Behaviors,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project will develop, test, apply, and disseminate multilevel statistical models and software for estimating
effects of intraindividual means, variances, slopes generated from multi-burst and continuous ILD designs to
predict cancer control behaviors and outcomes. Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality. Approximately
42% of new cancer cases in the U.S. are viewed as potentially avoidable including 19% caused by smoking and
18% caused by excess body weight, physical inactivity, excess alcohol consumption, and poor nutrition.
Intensive Longitudinal Data (ILD) methods, which collect many assessments captured at high density on a micro-
timescale (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours) using real-time data capture methodologies (e.g., Ecological
Momentary Assessment [EMA] and accelerometry), offer enormous opportunities for insight into the dynamic
nature of cancer control behaviors and outcomes. In ILD studies, it is common to have hundreds to thousands
of observations per subject, and this allows us to model intraindividual parameters comprised of time-varying
variables such as means (e.g., how unhappy is a subject, on average, across occasions?), variances (e.g., how
erratic is a subject’s mood across occasions?), and slopes (e.g., is a subject’s mood related to feelings of energy
across occasions?). In our prior work, we developed a software, called MixWILD, consisting of a series of two-
stage multilevel statistical models testing the effects of intraindividual means, variances, and slopes on time-
varying and subject-level outcomes. The next generation of ILD studies has begun to use multi-burst (e.g.,
multiple day EMA periods interspersed with days with no assessment) and continuous (e.g., 24-hour/days per
week smartwatch accelerometry) measurement designs, allowing the entire study to extend across months or
years. However, available data analysis techniques cannot address common substantive questions that arise
with multi-burst and continuous ILD designs such as does momentary mood variability increase across a year?
Also, do month-to-month increases in momentary mood variability predict declines in sleep duration over a year?
To address these gaps, we will develop multilevel models capable of (Aim 1) jointly estimating how within-burst
means, variability, and slopes differ between bursts and/or subjects, (Aim 2) testing predictors (either occasion,
burst-, person-level) of how within-burst means, variability, and slopes differ between bursts and/or subjects, and
(Aim 3) testing whether random effects from Aim 1 predict subject- and burst-level cancer control outcomes. We
will test and apply these statistical features by conducting secondary analyses of data from a multi-burst ILD
study of cancer control behaviors and outcome, which conducted mobile sensing, EMA, and accelerometry from
246 emerging adults (ages 18-29) across 12 months. We will also develop, test, and disseminate a stand-alone

"Sleep, pain, and recovery in kids after pediatric intensive care (SPARK-PICU)","Sleep, pain, and recovery in kids after pediatric intensive care (SPARK-PICU)","Project Summary
More than 250,000 children survive pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) hospitalization each year in the United
States, yet we have an incomplete understanding of recovery trajectory and modifiable factors to optimize
survivorship. PICU survivors have multisystem diseases and suffer multisystem morbidities many years after
hospital discharge in physical, cognitive, and psychosocial health domains. Our preliminary data indicate
presence of clinically significant pain among 1 in 3 children and sleep disturbances in over 50% of children
months to years after PICU hospitalization, placing them at risk for poorer long-term health outcomes.
However, key knowledge gaps remain in understanding risk factors and mechanisms for persistent pain and
sleep disturbances in PICU survivors, limiting potential interventions that could have broad implications for
long-term recovery. For example, PICU survivors are known to suffer substantial cognitive impairments,
particularly within the executive function construct, crucial to long-term academic achievement, quality of life,
and psychosocial well-being. Chronic pain and sleep disturbances are potentially modifiable, and linked to
worse executive function in other pediatric populations. However, we have an incomplete understanding of the
impact of pain and sleep on executive function outcomes in PICU survivors. The central hypothesis of this
proposal is that pain and sleep disturbances are important post-PICU morbidities that are key mediators
between acute illness factors, psychosocial vulnerabilities and executive function outcomes in children after
critical illness.
We will conduct a longitudinal outcomes study of PICU survivors aged 8-18 years with the following objectives:
1) Identify pain trajectories and biopsychosocial risk factors for chronic pain in PICU survivors; 2) Elucidate
longitudinal sleep disturbances in PICU survivors and sleep-pain associations over 12 months; 3) Test the
impact of sleep and pain on EF outcomes in PICU survivors over 12-months. The study will utilize objective
measures of acute illness severity, novel metrics of psychosocial vulnerabilities, and a mix of objective
assessment and subjective report of pain, sleep, and executive function outcomes to comprehensively
evaluate temporal and mediating relationships 3, 6, and 12-months after PICU hospitalization. This proposal is
significant because it addresses the common and debilitating morbidities of chronic pain and sleep
disturbances that affect thousands of PICU survivors annually. Our data will identify risk factors across a
biopsychosocial framework to improve identification and treatment of pain and sleep disturbances, and aligns
with the National Institutes of Health Sleep Disorders Research Plan and Federal Pain Research Strategy. This
research will provide a greater understanding of sleep, pain, and executive function in PICU survivors key for
designing and implementing interventions aimed at optimizing recovery.",<0-11 years old><21+ years old><Academic achievement><Acute><Acute Pain><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><Area><Attention><Behavior><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Care Givers><Caregivers><Cessation of life><Child><Child Youth><Childhood><Children (0-21)><Cognitive><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Collaborations><Critical Illness><Critically Ill><Data><Death><Development><Diagnosis><Disease><Disorder><Disturbance in cognition><Dysfunction><Emotional well being><Encephalon><Enrollment><Feels well><Functional disorder><Future><Health><History><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Hospitals><Hyperalgesia><Hyperalgesic Sensations><Immediate Memory><Impaired cognition><Injury><Intensive Care><Interdisciplinary Research><Interdisciplinary Study><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Knowledge><Link><Long-term cohort study><Longitudinal Studies><Longitudinal cohort study><Longterm cohort study><Maintenance><Measures><Mediating><Mediator><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Multidisciplinary Collaboration><Multidisciplinary Research><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Neurologic Dysfunctions><Normal mental condition><Normal mental state><Normal psyche><Outcome><Outcomes Research><Pain><Pain Control><Pain Research><Pain Therapy><Pain intensity><Pain management><Painful><Patients><Pediatric Intensive Care Units><Performance><Persistent pain><Personal Satisfaction><Persons><Physiopathology><Population><Prevalence><Prevention><Process><Psychological Well Being><Psychosocial Factor><QOL><Quality of life><Recording of previous events><Recovery><Reporting><Research><Research Priority><Risk><Risk Factors><Sense of well-being><Severity of illness><Short-Term Memory><Shortterm Memory><Sleep><Sleep Disorders><Sleep disturbances><Survey Instrument><Surveys><Survivors><System><Testing><Time><United States><United States National Institutes of Health><Well in self><Work><Youth><Youth 10-21><aberrant sleep><actigraph><actigraphy><adulthood><aged><biopsychosocial><chronic pain><chronic pain patient><clinical significance><clinically significant><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive loss><cognitive process><cognitive reappraisal><cognitive regulation><constant pain><design><designing><developmental><disability><disabling pain><disease severity><disrupted sleep><disturbed sleep><emotion regulation><emotional regulation><emotional wellbeing><emotional wellness><enroll><executive control><executive function><experience><flexibility><flexible><functional disability><histories><hyperalgia><impaired sleep><improved><injuries><interventional strategy><irregular sleep><kids><lasting pain><long term recovery><long-term study><longitudinal outcome studies><longterm study><malleable risk><meeting><meetings><mental well-being><mental wellbeing><mental wellness><modifiable risk><neurological dysfunction><non-medical opioid use><nonmedical opioid use><novel><on-going pain><ongoing pain><opiate misuse><opioid misuse><pain treatment><pain-related disability><pathophysiology><patient with chronic pain><pediatric><psychologic><psychological><psychological wellbeing><psychological wellness><psychosocial><psychosocial variables><psychosocial well-being><psychosocial wellbeing><psychosocial wellness><self wellness><sense of wellbeing><sleep diseases><sleep disruption><sleep dysfunction><sleep dysregulation><sleep illness><sleep problem><social engagement><social involvement><social participation><social vulnerability><survivorship><well-being><wellbeing><working memory><youngster>,Behavioral and Social Science; Chronic Pain; Clinical Research; Disability Research; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Mental Health; Neurosciences; Pain Research; Pediatric; Prevention; Rehabilitation; Sleep Research; Social Determinants of Health
Neural basis underlying the impact of stress on sleep,Neural basis underlying the impact of stress on sleep,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stress is associated with insufficient sleep and poor quality sleep. In particular, fragmented non-rapid eye
movement sleep (NREMs) due to frequent brief arousals (microarousals, MAs) disrupts sleep continuity, and
rapid eye movement sleep (REMs) abnormalities are often observed in patients with insomnia and depression.
Insufficient sleep and alterations in sleep microarchitecture caused by stress may in turn worsen the stress
symptoms, such as cognitive impairment, and have been shown to increase the risk of developing psychiatric
disorders. Nevertheless, the identity of the involved stress- and sleep-regulatory circuits, and the mechanisms
by which stress perturbs distinct features of the sleep architecture and negatively impacts cognitive behaviors
are still largely unclear. We have recently shown that acute psychosocial stress in mice decreases the amount
of sleep and disrupts sleep quality by causing frequent MAs and suppressing REMs. We propose that the
stress-induced decrease in the amount of sleep and changes in sleep microarchitecture are mediated by
different circuit mechanisms. The preoptic area of the hypothalamus (POA), a crucial center regulating macro-
and microarchitecture of sleep and wakefulness, is densely innervated by stress-regulatory noradrenergic
neurons in the locus coeruleus (NELC) and corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular
nucleus (CRHPVN). The goal of this proposal is to investigate to what extent the NELC and CRHPVN neurons
cause stress-induced sleep disturbances and memory impairment via projections to distinct POA
subpopulations. Our central hypothesis is that stress-induced MAs and REMs dysregulation are mediated by
inputs from NELC neurons to the POA (NELC→POA), while the overall decrease in sleep is mediated by inputs
from CRHPVN neurons (CRHPVN→POA) and that reversing sleep disturbances attenuates stress-induced memory
deficits. Aim 1 will determine the role of NELC→POA projections in stress-induced MAs and REMs dysregulation
as well as related memory deficits. Aim 2 will determine the role of CRHPVN→POA projections in stress-induced
wakefulness and related memory deficits. Accomplishing these aims will provide important insights into the
neural basis of stress-induced sleep disturbances and the benefits of good quality and quantity sleep in
reversing stress symptoms, with potential relevance to understand and develop novel therapeutic interventions
for stress-related sleep disorders.",<ACTH-Releasing Factor><Acute><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Arousal><Attenuated><Axon><Behavior><CCK><CRF-41><Cholecystokinin><Cognition><Cognitive><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive Manifestations><Cognitive Symptoms><Cognitive decline><Cognitive deficits><Cognitive function abnormal><Corticoliberin><Corticotropin-Releasing Factor><Corticotropin-Releasing Factor-41><Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone><Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone-41><Cyclicity><Deterioration><Dimensions><Disturbance in cognition><EEG><Electroencephalogram><Electroencephalography><Exhibits><Fast-Wave Sleep><Goals><Human><Hypothalamic structure><Hypothalamus><Image><Impaired cognition><Impairment><Insomnia><Insomnia Disorder><Locus Coeruleus><Mediating><Memory Deficit><Memory impairment><Mental Depression><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Mental disorders><Mental health disorders><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Murine><Mus><NREM><Nature><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neurobehavioral Manifestations><Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms><Neurocyte><Neurons><Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions><Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences><Nucleus Pigmentosus Pontis><Optics><Pancreozymin><Paradoxical Sleep><Paraventricular Hypothalamic Nucleus><Pathway interactions><Patients><Periodicity><Personal Satisfaction><Physiologic><Physiological><Preoptic Areas><Psychiatric Disease><Psychiatric Disorder><Psychological Health><Psychosocial Stress><REM Sleep><Regulatory Regions><Rhombencephalic Sleep><Rhythmicity><Risk><Role><Sleep><Sleep Architecture><Sleep Deprivation><Sleep Disorders><Sleep disturbances><Sleeplessness><Stress><Therapeutic><Uropancreozymin><Wakefulness><aberrant sleep><attenuate><attenuates><blue nucleus><cognitive ability><cognitive defects><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive loss><corticotropin releasing hormone><deficient sleep><depression><disrupted sleep><disturbed sleep><dreaming sleep><endomicrosope><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><genetic regulatory element><hypothalamic><imaging><impaired sleep><improved><improvement on sleep><inadequate sleep><insight><insufficient sleep><irregular sleep><locus ceruleus structure><memory dysfunction><mental illness><microendoscope><model of animal><neural><neural circuit><neural circuitry><neurobehavioral symptom><neurocircuitry><neuronal><new therapeutic approach><new therapeutic intervention><new therapeutic strategies><new therapy approaches><new treatment approach><new treatment strategy><non rapid eye movement><non-REM><non-rapid eye movement><nonREM><nonrapid eye movement><noradrenergic><novel><novel therapeutic approach><novel therapeutic intervention><novel therapeutic strategies><novel therapy approach><object recognition><optical><optogenetics><paraventricular nucleus><patch clamp><pathway><physical conditioning><physical health><preoptic region><presynaptic><psychiatric illness><psychological disorder><quality of sleep><rapid eye movement sleep><sleep abnormalities><sleep control><sleep debt><sleep deficiency><sleep deficit><sleep diseases><sleep disruption><sleep dysfunction><sleep dysregulation><sleep illness><sleep improvement><sleep insufficiency><sleep loss><sleep problem><sleep quality><sleep quantity><sleep regulation><social defeat><social role><stress symptom><synaptic circuit><synaptic circuitry><well-being><wellbeing>,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Mental Health; Neurosciences; Sleep Research
Family-centered integration of social and medical care to promote health equity among children with asthma,Family-centered integration of social and medical care to promote health equity among children with asthma,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Asthma inequitably impacts under-resourced, Black, and Hispanic youth who experience higher asthma
morbidity. These disparities are partially explained by social adversity experienced at multiple levels (child,
family, community). Yet, these critical associations between social adversity and pediatric asthma are not fully
incorporated into strategies to address morbidity among children which may exacerbate existing inequities,
meaning such at-risk children experience decreased quality of life, higher school absenteeism, and decreased
educational and employment achievement in late childhood and adulthood. In this proposal, Dr. Tyris’ objective
is to advance the existing knowledge on social adversity and asthma morbidity with diverse methodologies that
seek to better integrate social care (activities mitigating health-related adverse social factors) into medical care
for children. She will pursue this overall objective through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Predict risk of
hospitalization among DC children with asthma using multi-level social adversity indicators. A population-based
machine learning model using the DC Pediatric Asthma Registry (n= >19,000) and social adversity, clinical,
and demographic data will be developed to predict risk of asthma-related hospitalization and to identify which
variables are most predictive of children at highest risk for hospitalization. Aim 2: Characterize caregiver
perspectives of mechanisms to address modifiable family-level variables that impact child asthma morbidity. A
community advisory board will be established to conduct longitudinal focus groups and engage with caregivers
of children frequently hospitalized for asthma to refine family-level approaches to address social adversity and
enhance recruitment and retention issues for a pilot RCT. Aim 3: Determine feasibility and acceptability of an
integrated social care intervention of individualized assistance and adjustment strategies among caregivers of
children with asthma. Dr. Tyris will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to determine if using addressing
social adversity in routine asthma care with assistance (helping resolve social adversity) and adjustment
(modifying health care to overcome social barriers) will be acceptable to caregivers and feasible to implement.
The outlined career development plan, including the proposed aims, will enable Dr. Tyris to gain advanced
training and knowledge in four key areas: machine learning methods for risk prediction, stakeholder-engaged
intervention design, clinical trial design and execution, and integrated social and medical care interventions.
She will leverage the expertise of Dr. Tyris’ mentors (Drs. Teach and Parikh) and advisors (Drs. Trujillo Rivera,
Hinds, and Gottlieb) and the robust, supportive research environment at Children’s National Hospital and
George Washington University. Successful completion of this career development and research proposal will
facilitate Dr. Tyris’ overarching career goal to become an independent and federally funded investigator who
creates, implements, evaluates, and effectively translates stakeholder-engaged solutions designed to mitigate
social adversity, promote health equity, and improve care and outcomes for children with asthma.","<0-11 years old><21+ years old><Absenteeism><Access to Care><Accounting><Achievement><Achievement Attainment><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><Area><Asthma><Asthma in Children><Black><Black race><Blood Diseases><Bronchial Asthma><Calibration><Cardiac Diseases><Cardiac Disorders><Care Givers><Caregivers><Caring><Child><Child Care><Child Health><Child Youth><Childhood><Childhood Asthma><Children (0-21)><Chronic><Clinic Visits><Clinical><Clinical Trials Design><Communities><Complex><D.C.

Harnessing implementation science to study stress management for correctional officers in jail settings,Harnessing implementation science to study stress management for correctional officers in jail settings,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The purpose of this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Career Development award is to support Dr.
Margaret Gorvine's current trajectory toward independent investigator status—via achieving the study aims
and training goals to extend innovative research in the arenas of implementation science, integrative health,
and criminal justice. Dr. Gorvine is an Instructor/ Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Health Behavior and
Health Education in the College of Public Health, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS).
 Jail incarceration rates in the United States have tripled since the 1980s. More than 3,100 jails
nationwide serviced 10.8 million jail admissions in 2018. Jail correctional officers (COs) are responsible for
maintaining security and supervising detainees in facilities that are often low-resourced (e.g. funding, staffing
shortages), are overcrowded, and replete with health risk exposures (e.g. Covid-19). Therefore, COs
experience high levels of stress due to violence and low autonomy. The high risk of adverse mental health
outcomes and health disparities among COs necessitates addressing CO stress management in jail settings.
 The study will use an evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) method to achieve the first 2 aims
including: 1) identifying barriers and facilitators to implementing a stress management intervention for
correctional officers in a jail setting through formative evaluation (e.g. in-depth qualitative interviews with key
jail stakeholders); 2) developing an implementation strategy package and intervention modifications. Thirdly,
conduct a pilot hybrid type II effectiveness-implementation trial of the stress management intervention for
correctional officers at the jail, measuring implementation outcomes of acceptability, appropriateness,
feasibility, and fidelity of the intervention and the implementation strategy package.
 The training goals of the K01 Mentored Research Scientist Career Development award include: 1)
developing expertise in implementation research methods related to intervention delivery in jails; 2) enhance
skills in community-engaged research with partners within criminal justice settings; 3) learning how to build
community-engaged partnerships in the jail; 4) developing expertise in evidence-based mind-body intervention
delivery and research; and 5) Increase biostatistics expertise to be fully informed for in-depth collaboration with
biostatisticians.",<Address><Administrator><Admission><Admission activity><Affect><African American group><African American individual><African American people><African American population><African Americans><Anxiety><Arkansas><Armed Forces Personnel><Assess implementation><Biometrics><Biometry><Biostatistics><COVID-19><CV-19><Career Development Awards><Career Development Awards and Programs><Career Development Programs K-Series><Chronic><Clinical Trials><Collaborations><Competence><Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research><Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science><Consolidated Framework for Implementing Change><Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019><Criminal Justice><Crowding><Data><Dose><Education for Intervention><Educational Intervention><Effectiveness><Environment><Evidence based practice><Feeling suicidal><Funding><General Population><General Public><Goals><Health><Health Instruction><Health Tutoring><Health behavior><Health behavior and outcomes><Health education><Home><Hour><Hybrids><Implementation assessment><Imprisonment><Instruction Intervention><Integrative Medicine><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Intervention Studies><Intervention Trial><Interventional trial><Interview><Investigators><Jail><Job Location><Job Place><Job Setting><Job Site><Jobs><K-Awards><K-Series Research Career Programs><Learning><Life Expectancy><Measures><Medical><Mental Depression><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Mentors><Methods><Military><Military Personnel><Mind-Body Intervention><Mind-Body Medicine><Mindfulness Approach><Mindfulness Therapy><Mindfulness Training><Mindfulness Treatment><Mindfulness-based Approach><Mindfulness-based Therapy><Mindfulness-based Training><Mindfulness-based Treatment><Modification><NCCAM><NCCIH><National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health><National Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine><Nurses><Occupations><Outcome><PTSD><Participant><Police><Population><Post-Traumatic Neuroses><Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders><Postdoc><Postdoctoral Fellow><Posttraumatic Neuroses><Prisons><Process><Professional Positions><Psychological Health><Public Health><Relaxation><Reporting><Research><Research Associate><Research Career Program><Research Methodology><Research Methods><Research Personnel><Research Resources><Researchers><Resources><Risk><Safety><Science><Scientist><Security><Services><Site><Sleep disturbances><Stress><Suicidal thoughts><Testing><Training><Training Intervention><Translating><United States><Universities><Violence><Work><Work Location><Work Place><Work-Site><Workplace><Worksite><aberrant sleep><burden of chronic disease><burden of chronic illness><burn-out><burnout><cohort><college><collegiate><community building><community engaged participatory research><community engaged research><community partnered research><community-engaged study><community-partnered study><coronavirus disease 2019><coronavirus disease-19><coronavirus infectious disease-19><depression><disparity in health><disrupted sleep><disturbed sleep><effectiveness and implementation trial><effectiveness measure><effectiveness testing><effectiveness/implementation hybrid trial><effectiveness/implementation trial><evaluate implementation><evaluation of implementation><evidence base><experience><first responder><formative assessment><formative evaluation><health assessment><health disparity><health outcome disparity><health outcome inequality><health outcome inequity><health related behavior><high risk><homes><impaired sleep><implementation evaluation><implementation measures><implementation outcomes><implementation research><implementation science><implementation strategy><improved><improvement on sleep><incarcerated><incarceration><inequitable health outcome><innovate><innovation><innovative><instructional intervention><instructor><integrative healing><integrative health><intervention delivery><intervention research><interventional research><interventional strategy><interventional study><interventions research><irregular sleep><military population><mind body approach><mind body medicine skills><mind body techniques><mind body therapy><mind body treatments><mind body wellness><mind/body><mindfulness><negative affect><negative affectivity><novel><nurse><perceived stress><perception of stress><pilot test><post-doc><post-doctoral><post-doctoral trainee><post-trauma stress disorder><posttrauma stress disorder><primary outcome><quality of sleep><racial disparities in health><racial health disparity><research and methods><research associates><resilience><resilient><self-reported stress><skills><sleep disruption><sleep dysregulation><sleep improvement><sleep quality><strategies for implementation><stress buffering><stress management><stress perception><stress reactivity><suicidal ideation><suicidal thinking><suicide ideation><thoughts about suicide><traumatic neurosis><unequal health outcome><uptake><violent><violent behavior><work setting>,Behavioral and Social Science;

Cincinnati Children's Summer Medical Student Respiratory Research Fellowship,Cincinnati Children's Summer Medical Student Respiratory Research Fellowship,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a shortage of well-trained research-oriented physicians who are prepared to develop new
approaches to prevent, diagnose and treat childhood respiratory diseases. This limited pool of well-
established investigators is further threatened by a decreasing number of young physician scientists who
choose to specialize in pediatric respiratory disciplines. Training at all levels is an important priority at
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital which has established extensive programs for developing MD, PHD and
MD/PhD fellows and faculty into independent clinical and basic science investigators.
The Pediatric Pulmonary Division at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is uniquely
positioned to interest students in careers focused on pediatric respiratory disorders. Pulmonary research at
CCHMC has very strong and diverse clinical and basic science research programs and the Sleep Disorder
Center is one of the few pediatric programs in the United States that has a certified pediatric sleep fellowship
program with an extensive research focus.
This proposal will provide a 10 week summer research fellowship for 12 medical
students following their first year of medical school. The program has a well-organized method of selection of
trainees from a competitive pool of medical students with outstanding academic qualifications. A faculty of
over 35 MDs, PhDs and MD/PhDs from multiple departments with a proven record of success in research
and mentoring are available to the trainees. All investigators are well-funded in NHLBI-focused research
areas focused on pediatric respiratory disorders. Included within the program are opportunities to pursue
basic and clinical research projects with weekly meetings at which instruction in responsible conduct of
research and specific clinical and research topics in pulmonary and sleep medicine are provided.
Students present their projects to peers and mentors at the end of summer symposium. Past trainees
rate the program highly on research education received and report a very high interest in pursuing careers
in research at the end of the summer. Past trainees have been consistently successful in publishing
manuscripts and winning awards for their research at national meetings.
The strengths of our research programs in the areas of pediatric pulmonary and sleep medicine combined
with an enthusiastic faculty and a well-organized summer program provides an excellent opportunity to
attract physician trainees at early and critical stages in their careers and increase the likelihood they will
want to further pursue research as physician- scientists.","<0-11 years old><Area><Award><Basic Research><Basic Science><Certification><Child><Child Youth><Childhood><Children (0-21)><Children's Hospital><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Sciences><Clinical Study><Diagnosis><Discipline><Doctor of Philosophy><Faculty><Fellowship><Fellowship Program><Funding><Instruction><Investigators><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><MD students><Manuscripts><Medical Students><Medical center><Medicine><Mentors><Methods><NHLBI><National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute><Pediatric Hospitals><Ph.D.><PhD><Physicians><Position><Positioning Attribute><Publishing><Qualifying><R-Series Research Projects><R01 Mechanism><R01 Program><Reporting><Research><Research Grants><Research Personnel><Research Project Grants><Research Projects><Research Training><Researchers><Respiration Disorders><Respiratory Disease><Respiratory Disorder><Respiratory System Disease><Respiratory System Disorder><Scientist><Sleep><Sleep Disorders><Students><Training><United States><breathing disorder><career><conference><convention><education research><interest><kids><medical college><medical school students><medical schools><meeting><meetings><new approaches><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><pediatric><peer><prevent><preventing><programs><pulmonary><respiratory><respiratory dysfunction><responsible research conduct><school of medicine><sleep diseases><sleep dysfunction><sleep illness><sleep problem><success><summer program><summer research><summer session><summit><symposia><symposium><youngster>",Lung; Pediatric; Sleep Research
Longitudinal changes in vascular and autonomic function in premenopausal women with PTSD,Longitudinal changes in vascular and autonomic function in premenopausal women with PTSD,"Project Summary
The ultimate objective of this R03 proposal is to enable Dr. Ida Fonkoue to launch her independent research
career by 1) expanding her current K01 research objectives; 2) providing additional support in her transition to
a future NIH R01 grant; and 3) generating sufficient preliminary results to support that R01 application. The
candidate’s long-term goal is to build an NIH-funded research program in clinical and translational research in
women’s health, studying longitudinal derangements of vascular, neural and hormonal control, that contribute
to the high rates of hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women living with chronic stress
exposure such as those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder or panic
disorder. Over 7 million U.S. adults have PTSD, a disorder associated with a greater risk for hypertension and
CVD. While healthy premenopausal women are relatively protected from CVD compared to men, a diagnosis
of PTSD increases CVD risk in women by up to 3-fold. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, over 60 million women in the United States are living with some form of heart disease.
Understanding the mechanisms underlying long-term CVD risk in women with PTSD is of paramount
importance to develop intervention strategies aiming at protecting the future health of this vulnerable
population. Based on our preliminary data, the working hypothesis of this project is that: Over time, PTSD
significantly inhibits nitric oxide bioavailability, resulting in accelerated autonomic and vascular dysfunctions in
premenopausal women; and that these changes are exacerbated by low estradiol (E2) levels and sleep
disturbances. Aim 1 will measure longitudinal alterations in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity in
premenopausal women with PTSD and determine the extent to which these alterations are a function of low E2
levels and low sleep efficiency at two years follow-up. Aim 2 will measure longitudinal alterations in vascular
function in premenopausal women with PTSD and determine the extent to which these alterations are a
function of low E2 levels and low sleep efficiency at two years follow-up. We will use gold-standard in vivo
measures of sympathetic nerve activity (microneurography), endothelial (FMD) and vascular (applanation
tonometry) function to study young, traumatized women with and without PTSD. The university of Minnesota
University, where the project will be completed, boasts an intellectually rich research environment whose
resources will be used to carry out the proposed research, including an NIH-funded Clinical and Translational
Science Institute (CTSI). During this R03 award, the PI will devote 75% effort to this project and her current
K01 project. She recently achieved an important career-development milestone for her transition to full
independence by completing her Master of Science in Clinical Research. This research project, combined with
findings from her K01 and ongoing multidisciplinary mentorship, will help Dr. Fonkoue launch and sustain a
meritorious R01-funded independent research program.","<21+ years old><Acceleration><Active Follow-up><Adult><Adult Human><Age><Aquadiol><Autonomic Dysfunction><Award><BMI><BMI percentile><BMI

"Untangling the bidirectional relationship between the spread of pathological protein aggregates, sleep, and circadian clock disruption in neurodegenerative disease","Untangling the bidirectional relationship between the spread of pathological protein aggregates, sleep, and circadian clock disruption in neurodegenerative disease","PROJECT SUMMARY
 Over 7 million Americans currently suffer from a neurodegenerative disease (NDD), including
Alzheimer’s disease and multiple system atrophy. In these disorders, intrinsically disordered proteins, including
tau and α-synuclein (α-syn), misfold into a prion-like conformation capable of self-templating and spreading
throughout the brain, causing progressive degeneration. Although age is the greatest known risk factor for the
onset of NDDs, we urgently need to understand the mechanisms by which treatable risk factors contribute to
disease, including sleep and circadian clock disruption. It is well established that sleep disruption impairs
autophagy, whereas promoting autophagy via small molecules, such as rapamycin, delays disease onset in
animal models of NDD. Given the growing literature identifying poor sleep quality and sleep disorders as both a
preclinical sign and a symptom of NDDs, there is an increasing need to determine if protein misfolding leads to
sleep and circadian desynchronization, if environmental circadian desynchronization (ECD) leads to protein
misfolding, or if both occur in a positive feedback loop that is mediated via impaired autophagic activity. The
long-term goal of our research is to understand the shared molecular mechanisms that contribute to the onset
and progression of NDD. Our objective is to establish the mechanism(s) by which disrupted sleep and
circadian timing contribute to the formation and spread of pathogenic tau and α-syn in the brain. We
hypothesize that the effects of circadian clock disruption on tau and α-syn spreading in NDD are mediated by
altered autophagic activity in the brain. Rather than a linear signaling pathway, we anticipate that ECD sits atop
a positive feedback loop exacerbated by the presence of pathogenic protein in the brain. Our approach will
investigate the bidirectional nature of this relationship. In Aim 1, we will investigate the effect of tau and α-syn
propagation on sleep and circadian rhythms, and will determine if enhancing autophagy can slow these effects.
In Aim 2, we will interrogate the effect of circadian clock manipulation on the onset and progression of NDD.
We will also determine if ECD impairs autophagic activity to accelerate protein misfolding in the brain. While
epidemiological and experimental studies have shown a clear interaction between circadian rhythms and
NDDs, the nature of that relationship remains unclear. Successful completion of the proposed studies will
determine if NDD drives circadian and sleep disruption, if ECD can drive NDD, and/or if the two exacerbate
one another through a positive feedback loop. Notably, because this proposal draws on Dr. Woerman’s
expertise in tau and α-syn misfolding in NDD and Dr. Karatsoreos’ expertise in circadian clock regulation of
brain function, we are uniquely positioned as a multi-PI team to address this important question.",<AD dementia><Acceleration><Address><Age><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><Amentia><American><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Autophagocytosis><Biological Rhythm><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Circadian Dysregulation><Circadian Rhythms><Circadian desynchrony><Clinical><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Dementia><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Dysautonomia-Orthostatic Hypotension Syndrome><Dysautonomic Orthostatic Hypotension><Encephalon><Epidemiologic Research><Epidemiologic Studies><Epidemiological Studies><Epidemiology Research><Feedback><Future><Goals><Hour><Impairment><Individual><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Knowledge><Literature><MT-bound tau><Measures><Mediating><Methods><Modeling><Molecular><Molecular Configuration><Molecular Conformation><Molecular Stereochemistry><Multiple System Atrophy><Multiple System Atrophy Syndrome><Multisystem Atrophy><Multisystemic Atrophy><NAC precursor><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Nature><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Nyctohemeral Rhythm><Onset of illness><PARK1 protein><PARK4 protein><Pathogenicity><Pathologic><Patients><Position><Positioning Attribute><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Progressive Autonomic Failure><Proteins><Rapamune><Rapamycin><Regulation><Research><Risk Factors><Role><SNCA><SNCA protein><Shy-Drager Syndrome><Shy-Drager Type Idiopathic Orthostatic Hypotension><Signal Pathway><Sirolimus><Sleep><Sleep Disorders><Sleep disturbances><Sorting><Symptoms><Time-restricted eating><Time-restricted feeding><Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm><United States National Institutes of Health><Work><a-syn><a-synuclein><aberrant protein folding><aberrant sleep><abnormal protein folding><abnormal tau><ages><alpha synuclein><alpha synuclein gene><alphaSP22><asyn><autophagy><circadian><circadian abnormality><circadian clock><circadian desynchronization><circadian disruption><circadian disturbance><circadian dysfunction><circadian impairment><circadian misalignment><circadian pacemaker><circadian process><conformation><conformational><conformational state><conformationally><conformations><daily biorhythm><day shift><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><disease onset><disorder onset><disrupted sleep><disturbed sleep><epidemiologic investigation><epidemiology study><experience><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><impaired sleep><insoluble aggregate><interventional strategy><irregular sleep><microtubule associated protein tau mutation><microtubule bound tau><microtubule-associated protein tau mutation><microtubule-bound tau><model of animal><mouse model><murine model><mutant tau><mutation in microtubule associated protein tau><mutation in microtubule-associated protein tau><neurodegenerative illness><night shift><night work><non A-beta component of AD amyloid><non A4 component of amyloid precursor><novel><pathogenic tau><pathogenic tau gene mutation><pathologic protein folding><pathological change in tau><poor sleep><pre-clinical><preclinical><primary degenerative dementia><prion-like><protein aggregate><protein aggregation><protein misfolding><quality of sleep><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><shift work><shiftwork><sleep diseases><sleep disruption><sleep dysfunction><sleep dysregulation><sleep illness><sleep problem><sleep quality><small molecule><social role><tau><tau Proteins><tau abnormality><tau factor><tau intronic mutation><tau mutation><tau pathological change><time use><α synuclein gene><α-syn><α-synuclein><τ Proteins><τ mutation>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Dementia; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Sleep Research
Physiological and Behavioral Basis of Circadian Rhythm Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder,Physiological and Behavioral Basis of Circadian Rhythm Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Delayed Sleep Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD) is a common circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder that is
characterized by difficulty in initiating sleep at night and subsequent difficulty in waking at times required for work
or school. Consequently, DSWPD is often associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, reduced academic and
work performance, mood disturbances and reduced quality of life. Considering the significant negative impact of
DSWPD on sleep quality, performance, mental and physical health and well-being, the physiological basis of the
disorder surprisingly remains unclear. Classically, DSWPD is assumed to stem from a delay of central circadian
timing. However, recent evidence shows that those clinically diagnosed with DSWPD fall into at least two distinct
phenotypes: those with delayed circadian timing and sleep (DSWPD1) and those with typical circadian timing
but delayed sleep (DSWPD2). Using pupillometry, our group has shown differences in light sensitivity between
the DSWPD1 and DSWPD2 subtypes, as well as within the DSWPD1 group (high (HLS) and low sensitivity to
light (LLS)), indicating that clinically diagnosed DSWPD likely represents a complex interplay between underlying
physiological differences and behaviors that can affect sleep timing. However, current diagnostic criteria do not
consider these distinct phenotypes, which can limit diagnostic accuracy and hinder the development of
personalized treatments that target the underlying alterations in physiology and behavior of these DSWPD
subtypes. The overall goal of the proposed research is to identify the physiological basis of DSWPD subtypes,
and to use these findings to inform development of mechanistically based approaches in circadian medicine.
This project will enroll 220 patients with DSWPD who will undergo circadian physiological and behavioral
phenotyping by actigraphy, dim light melatonin sampling, pupillary light sensitivity, as well as assessment of
mood, alertness and meal timing using questionnaires. In addition, we will evaluate light sensitivity in LLS
DSWPD1, as measured by the suppression of melatonin, and test whether the SSRI citalopram can enhance
light sensitivity. Finally, mathematical modeling will be used to integrate physiological (pupillometry) and
behavioral assessments to identify DSWPD subtypes. The proposed research will form the basis for the
development of light sensitivity-based tools and algorithms that integrate physiological and behavioral
biomarkers which can lead to a personalized multimodal approach for the care of patients with circadian rhythm
disorders.",<21+ years old><Accuracy of Diagnosis><Acute><Adolescent and Young Adult><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><Algorithms><Anxiety><Behavior><Behavior assessment><Behavioral><Biological Markers><Cardiometabolic Disease><Cardiometabolic Disorder><Categories><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Circadian Rhythm Disorder><Circadian Rhythms><Citalopram><Clinical><Clinical Treatment><Clinical Trials><Complex><Cytalopram><Data><Development><Diagnostic tests><Disease><Disorder><Double-Blind Method><Double-Blind Study><Double-Blinded><Double-Masked Method><Double-Masked Study><Dysfunction><Ecological momentary assessment><Enrollment><Environment><Excessive Daytime Sleepiness><Excessive daytime somnolence><Exhibits><Functional disorder><Future><Goals><Health><Illumination><Individual><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Label><Light><Light Sensitivity><Lighting><Math Models><Measurement><Measures><Medicine><Melatonin><Mental Depression><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Methods><Modeling><Moods><Nyctohemeral Rhythm><Outcome><Participant><Patient Care><Patient Care Delivery><Patients><Pattern><Performance><Performance at work><Personal Satisfaction><Persons><Phase><Phenotype><Photophobia><Photoradiation><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiology><Physiopathology><Placebo Control><Placebos><Population><Precision care><Predisposition><Prevalence><Prevention><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Psychological Health><Pupil><Pupil light reflex><QOL><Quality of life><Questionnaires><Randomized><Reporting><Research><Rest><SSRI><SSRIs><Salivary><Sampling><Schools><Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor><Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor><Sham Treatment><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Sleep><Susceptibility><Testing><Treatment Effectiveness><Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm><Work><accurate diagnostics><actigraph><actigraphy><adulthood><affective disturbance><alertness><behavior phenotype><behavioral assessment><behavioral phenotyping><bio-markers><biologic marker><biological signal transduction><biomarker><care for patients><care of patients><caring for patients><circadian><circadian process><clinical diagnosis><compare to control><comparison control><customized therapy><customized treatment><daily biorhythm><depression><design><designing><developmental><diagnostic accuracy><diagnostic approach><diagnostic criteria><diagnostic strategy><disease risk><disease subgroups><disease subtype><disorder risk><disorder subtype><disturbance in affect><effective therapy><effective treatment><enroll><falls><improved><individualized care><individualized medicine><individualized patient care><individualized patient treatment><individualized strategies><individualized therapeutic strategy><individualized therapy><individualized treatment><job performance><mathematic model><mathematical model><mathematical modeling><mood alteration><mood and affect disturbance><mood disturbance><mood dysfunction><multi-modality><multimodality><pathophysiology><patient specific therapies><patient specific treatment><personalization of treatment><personalized care><personalized medicine><personalized patient care><personalized strategies><personalized therapy><personalized treatment><phenotypic biomarker><phenotypic marker><physical conditioning><physical health><placebo controlled><pupillary light reflex><pupillary reflex><quality of sleep><randomisation><randomization><randomly assigned><response><serotonin reuptake inhibitor><sham therapy><sleep quality><stem><suprachiasmatic nucleus><tailored medical treatment><tailored therapy><tailored treatment><time use><tool><treatment strategy><trial regimen><trial treatment><unique treatment><well-being><wellbeing><work performance>,Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Neurosciences; Precision Medicine; Sleep Research
UroMarker Test Panel for Obstructive Sleep Apnea,UroMarker Test Panel for Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 PGXL Technologies is developing a patented, non-invasive urine-based assay for obstructive sleep
apnea (OSA) in children. OSA occurs in up to 3% of children and as much as 10% of the pediatric orthodontic
population. OSA can lead to disturbed sleep, neurobehavioral problems, neurocognitive impairments, and
hypertension in children. Diagnosis is primarily limited to in-clinic sleep studies because patient history and
physical examinations are not adequately able to differentiate OSA from primary snoring (PS), i.e., snoring
without associated sleep apnea or underlying sleep disorder. Polysomnography (PSG) tests are the gold
standard for diagnosis, but they are highly expensive, require an overnight stay in a supervised sleep clinic, are
difficult for children, and do not meet the need for screening OSA. There are several home sleep tests (HSTs)
that have been cleared for use in children that use similar sensors and methods as PSG studies in the home,
but the Academy of Sleep Medicine currently does not recommend the use of HSTs for diagnosis of OSA in
children due to the lack of physician supervision and a lack of sufficient evidence of efficacy. There is an unmet
need for a rapid and sensitive test for OSA that can be used for potential diagnosis, patient monitoring as they
undergo treatment, and screening of broader populations. PGXL Technologies is advancing development of a
urine-based, multiplexed immunoassay for screening children for OSA. The four biomarkers urocortin-3
(UCN3), kallikrein-1, orosomucoid-1, and uromodulin are present in urine and have previously shown high
sensitivity and specificity for detection of OSA in children using ELISA assays. Prior to this project, PGXL has
adapted two of the four biomarkers to the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform, a clinical diagnostic platform
based on a highly sensitive electrochemiluminescent detection approach. PGXL has demonstrated initial
clinically relevant detection for two biomarkers, and acquired a retrospective set of pediatric urine samples that
can be used to determine reference ranges. The goal of this Fast-Track proposal will be to advance
development through initial clinical validation. In Phase I, of this Fast-Track project, PGXL will integrate
immunoassays for the remaining biomarkers and optimize the analytical range for each of the assays in the
UroMarker panel using pediatric urine specimens. In Phase II, PGXL will complete analytical validation
required to meet CLIA requirements and conduct a prospective study to establish clinical cutoffs for an
algorithm that includes all four biomarkers. PGXL will also develop a prototype urine collection kit that can be
used for urine collection at home and mailed to a CLIA lab for analysis. Success with these goals will also
inform a larger multi-site clinical study that is expected in Phase IIb and will support FDA clearance of the test.
These milestones provide a path toward the commercial deployment of a high-throughput, multiplex test for
rapid OSA screening through simple home-based sample collection to improve patient outcomes.","<0-11 years old><A(1)-Acid Seromucoid><Academy><Acid Seromucoid><Adenoidectomy><Advanced Development><Affect><Algorithms><Antibodies><Apnea><Assay><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Biological Markers><CLIA accredited><CLIA approved><CLIA certified><CLIA compliant><CLIA licensed><Child><Child Youth><Childhood><Children (0-21)><Clinic><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Clinical Trials><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Collection><Detection><Diagnosis><Diagnostic Device><Diagnostic Equipment><Diagnostic Method><Diagnostic Procedure><Diagnostic Technique><Disturbance in cognition><ELISA><Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay><Frequencies><Future><Glandular Kallikrein-1><Goals><Health><History><Home><Hypertension><Hypoxia><Hypoxic><IQ Deficit><IRB><IRBs><Immunoassay><Impaired cognition><Institutional Review Boards><Investments><Kallikrein 1><Laboratories><Legal patent><Literature><Measures><Medical Inspection><Medicine><Methods><Multi-center clinical study><Multi-site clinical study><Multicenter clinical study><Multisite clinical study><Myocardial depression><Myocardial dysfunction><Neurocognitive Deficit><Obstructive Sleep Apnea><Orosomucoid><Orthodontic><Oxygen Deficiency><Pancreatic Kallikrein><Patents><Patient Monitoring><Patient outcome><Patient-Centered Outcomes><Patient-Focused Outcomes><Patients><Phase><Physical Examination><Physicians><Polysomnography><Population><Prevalence><Prospective Studies><Proteins><Recording of previous events><Reference Ranges><Reference Values><Research Specimen><Sampling><Sensitivity and Specificity><Seromucoid><Serum Sialomucin><Severities><Shipping><Site><Sleep><Sleep Apnea><Sleep Apnea Syndromes><Sleep Disorders><Sleep Hypopnea><Sleep Monitoring><Sleep disturbances><Sleep-Disordered Breathing><Snoring><Somnography><Specific qualifier value><Specificity><Specified><Specimen><Stress><Supervision><Syndrome, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive><System><THGP><THP gene><THP protein><Technology><Testing><Time><Tonsillectomy><UMOD><UMOD gene><Urinary Kallikrein><Urine><Validation><Vascular Hypertensive Disease><Vascular Hypertensive Disorder><aberrant sleep><alpha 1-Acid Glycoprotein><alpha 1-Acid Seromucoid><bio-markers><biologic marker><biomarker><biomarker array><biomarker panel><cardiac dysfunction><clinical diagnostics><clinical relevance><clinically relevant><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive loss><commercialization><cost><cost effective><design><designing><detection test><detection tests><diagnosis standard><diagnostic algorithm><diagnostic development><diagnostic platform><diagnostic system><disrupted sleep><disturbed sleep><enzyme linked immunoassay><experience><heart dysfunction><high blood pressure><histories><homes><hyperpiesia><hyperpiesis><hypertensive disease><hypertensive disorder><impaired sleep><improved><improved outcome><in-vitro diagnostics><indexing><intelligence quotient deficit><irregular sleep><kids><marker panel><medical diagnostic><multiplex assay><neurobehavioral><neurocognitive decline><neurocognitive impairment><novel><patient oriented outcomes><pediatric><physical examinations><polysomnographic><prospective><prototype><rapid assay><rapid test><rapid tests><sample collection><screening><screenings><sensor><sleep diseases><sleep disruption><sleep dysfunction><sleep dysregulation><sleep illness><sleep measurement><sleep polysomnography><sleep problem><sleep-related breathing disorder><specimen collection><standard care><standard treatment><success><systemic inflammation><systemic inflammatory response><urocortin><urocortin I><uromodulin><validations><youngster>",Behavioral and Social Science; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Lung; Pediatric; Sleep Research
BREATH: Breakthrough Research in Electromyography for the Assessment of Sleep-disordered BreaTHing,BREATH: Breakthrough Research in Electromyography for the Assessment of Sleep-disordered BreaTHing,"Project Summary Abstract
Objectives and Specific Aims: The overarching objective is to develop and validate a diagnostic tool for
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), Deep Learning-enhanced Transmembranous Electromyography (DL-tmEMG),
to enable convenient point-of-care, and accurate detection of OSA for widespread use by any practitioner
evaluating patients for OSA. In phase 1, this proposal aims to establish feasibility of tmEMG to diagnose OSA
patients with good accuracy and to optimize the DL algorithm. Phase 2 aims to demonstrate generalizability
and accuracy of DL-tmEMG in a diverse population, identifying differences in important subpopulations and the
benefits of multimodal data integration, while progressing regulatory approval.
Health-relatedness: This project addresses the urgent need for efficient and accurate diagnostics for OSA, a
widespread and serious disorder impacting an estimated 1 billion people worldwide, while undiagnosed OSA
costs the U.S. approximately $149.6 billion annually. Successful development of DL-tmEMG will enhance
personalized OSA management and improve healthcare accessibility. Efficient screening for OSA in under-
resourced areas and for patients pre-surgically and perinatally are relevant to this proposal.
Design: Phase 1 Study#1 (9 months) is a case-control observational feasibility study of 60 adult patients.
Phase 2 Study #2 (18 months) involves a large single center prospective observational cohort study of 200
adult patients referred for PSG testing at the UCSD Sleep Center.
Methods: DL-tmEMG is a new diagnostic that incorporates two novel technologies: 1) a non-invasive
transmembranous sensor of muscle activity (tmEMG), and 2) deep learning algorithms applied to EMG signal
to provide an automatic interpretation (EMGNet). The combination of these two innovations obviates the need
for an expert electromyographer, key to allowing for widespread use to fulfill the unmet need for improved
diagnostics in OSA. In Phase 1 Study #1, 30 healthy and 30 patients with moderate to severe OSA will
undergo DL-tmEMG within 30 days of polysomnography. We will compare DL-tmEMG classification results
with PSG results and calculate performance metrics. Phase 2 Study #2 utilizes a similar methodology as
Study #1 but differs in size as well as population pretest probabilities, being a cohort study design. Patients will
undergo DL-tmEMG within 30 days of PSG, which will classify patients as OSA (AHI>5) or non-OSA (AHI<5).
The performance of DL-tmEMG will again be compared with PSG results. Recruitment will be adjusted to allow
performance to be evaluated in important sub-populations.
Results of this prospective study will provide strong evidence for validity and reliability of DL-tmEMG as a novel
diagnostic tool for OSA and will be used to support a multicenter study (a phase IIB proposal) that will further
evaluate the performance of DL-tmEMG across sites and diverse patient populations to meet FDA submission
requirements, as part of a 510(k) premarket notification or a premarket approval (PMA) process.","<21+ years old><Accuracy of Diagnosis><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Age><Algorithms><Area><Buccal Cavity><Buccal Cavity Head and Neck><California><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Cavitas Oris><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Characteristics><Classification><Clinic><Clinical><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Cohort Studies><Collaborations><Concurrent Studies><Country><Dangerousness><Detection><Development><Devices><Diagnosis><Diagnostic><Diagnostic tests><Disease><Disorder><Disturbance in cognition><Early Intervention><Electromyography><Ethnic Origin><Ethnicity><Evaluation><Feasibility Studies><Gender><Goals><HIPAA><Health><Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act><Heart Vascular><Human><Impaired cognition><Individual><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investments><Kennedy Kassebaum Act><Legal patent><Marketing><Measures><Methodology><Methods><Modality><Modern Man><Mouth><Multi-center studies><Multicenter Studies><Muscle><Muscle Tissue><Needles><Notification><Obstructive Sleep Apnea><Oral><Oral cavity><PL 104-191><PL104-191><Pain><Painful><Painless><Patents><Patient Triage><Patients><Pattern><Perception><Performance><Perinatal><Peripartum><Peripheral nerve injury><Persons><Pharyngeal structure><Pharynx><Phase><Phase I Study><Pilot Projects><Play><Polysomnography><Population><Population Heterogeneity><Probability><Process><Prospective Studies><Prospective, cohort study><Public Law 104-191><QOL><Quality of life><Race><Races><Reporting><Research><Research Design><Research Resources><Resources><Risk><STTR><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Site><Sleep><Sleep Apnea><Sleep Apnea Syndromes><Sleep Disorders><Sleep Hypopnea><Sleep Monitoring><Sleep-Disordered Breathing><Small Business Technology Transfer Research><Somnography><Study Type><Syndrome, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive><System><Systematics><Technology><Testing><Throat><Time><Touch><Touch sensation><Translations><United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act><Universities><Validity and Reliability><Work><access to health care><access to healthcare><accessibility of health care><accessibility to health care><accessibility to healthcare><accurate diagnosis><accurate diagnostics><adulthood><ages><biological signal transduction><case control><case-controlled><circulatory system><clinical exam><clinical examination><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive loss><cohort><computerized data processing><cost><cost effective><data acquisition><data acquisitions><data integration><data processing><deep learning><deep learning algorithm><deep learning method><deep learning strategy><design><designing><developmental><diagnostic accuracy><diagnostic profile><diagnostic signature><diagnostic tool><disparity in care><disparity in healthcare><diverse populations><health care access><health care availability><health care disparity><health care inequality><health care inequity><health care service access><health care service availability><health care settings><health record><healthcare access><healthcare accessibility><healthcare availability><healthcare disparity><healthcare inequality><healthcare inequity><healthcare service access><healthcare service availability><healthcare settings><heterogeneous population><improved><indexing><innovate><innovation><innovative><innovative technologies><machine learning based model><machine learning model><meeting><meetings><motor control><multi-modal data><multi-modal datasets><multimodal data><multimodal datasets><muscular><neuromuscular><neuromuscular function><new diagnostics><new technology><next generation diagnostics><non-painful><nonpainful><not painful><novel><novel diagnostics><novel technologies><observational cohort study><patient population><peripheral nerve crush injuries><personalization of treatment><personalized medicine><personalized therapy><personalized treatment><phase 1 study><phase 2 study><phase II study><pilot study><point of care><point-of-care diagnostics><polysomnographic><population diversity><prospective><prototype><racial><racial background><racial origin><recruit><response><screening><screenings><sensor><sleep diseases><sleep dysfunction><sleep illness><sleep measurement><sleep polysomnography><sleep problem><sleep-related breathing disorder><study design><tactile sensation><translation><trial readiness><uptake>",Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Lung; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Neurosciences; Sleep Research
Real-time and randomized tests of social media and mental health interplay in early adolescence,Real-time and randomized tests of social media and mental health interplay in early adolescence,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adolescent mental health has worsened over the last decade and increased time spent on social media is often
cited as a contributing factor. Parents, policymakers, and educators are being told to curb social media use.
However, whether restricting or changing exposure to social media use will impact mental health is largely
unknown. This research builds on our previous prospective, longitudinal, and intensive study of a population
representative sample of young adolescents. Mental health symptoms and social media use will be captured at
the daily, weekly, and yearly levels via ecological momentary assessment (EMA), passive sensing, wearable
technologies, and a new youth co-created open application program interface (API) toolkit. Social media
engagement will be captured via real time assessments alongside the extraction of social media histories via a
youth co-created API toolkit. A large representative sample of 2500 11- to 15-year-olds will be followed over four
years, with a subset of 750 adolescents followed intensively via EMA to experimentally test whether social media
restriction versus scaffolding (a) modifies social media engagement and (b) impacts mental health symptoms in
the moment, across days, and over years. Early adolescence is a key period for testing bi-directional associations
between social media use and mental health given the onset of common and costly mental disorders like anxiety
and depression, evidence of heightened response to interventions, and the fact that young people begin to
navigate online spaces independently at this time. The study is positioned to impact on science, practice, and
policy by (1) advancing discovery related to differential bi-directional influences between social media and mental
health, (2) testing whether experimental modifications to social media-engagement impact same day and future

Validation of a novel cortical biomarker signature for pain,Validation of a novel cortical biomarker signature for pain,"Summary
Chronic pain is a major health burden associated with immense economic and social costs. Predictive
biomarkers that can identify individuals at risk of developing severe and persistent pain, which is associated with
worse disability and greater reliance on opioids, would promote aggressive, early intervention that could halt the
transition to chronic pain. Our team has uncovered evidence of a unique cortical biomarker signature that predicts
pain susceptibility (severity and duration). The biomarker signature combines resting state sensorimotor peak
alpha frequency (PAF) measured using electroencephalograph (EEG) and corticomotor excitability (CME)
measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This PAF/CME biomarker signature could be capable
of predicting the severity of pain experienced by an individual minutes to months in the future, as well as the
duration of pain (time to recovery). In the R61 phase of the current proposal, we aim to undertake analytical
validation of this biomarker in healthy participants using a standardized model of the transition to sustained
myofascial temporomandibular pain (masseter intramuscular injection of nerve growth factor, n=150). We will
record PAF/CME at multiple time points before and during the development of pain and use online diaries and
in-laboratory assessments of pain, sleep, stress, and other psychosocial variables. Specifically, we will test if the
biomarker signature predicts an individual's pain sensitivity (high- or low-pain sensitive) with at least 75%
accuracy. We will also test whether the biomarker signature predicts pain severity (on a 0-10 scale) and pain
duration (number of days until pain resolves). We will use multiple statistical approaches to optimize and test the
performance of the predictive biomarker. In the R33 phase we then aim to perform initial clinical validation to
determine whether the optimized PAF/CME biomarker signature predicts pain severity and duration in patients
with new onset myofascial temporomandibular disorder (TMD; n=30). We expect our work to result in the delivery
of a candidate biomarker signature ready for advanced prospective clinical validation studies.",<Acute><Affective><Analgesia Tests><Automation><Biological Markers><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cancers><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Clinical><Data><Detection><Development><Disabling condition><Disabling health condition><Disease Outcome><EEG><Early Intervention><Economic Burden><Economics><Electroencephalogram><Electroencephalography><Encephalon><Frequencies><Future><Health><Human><Individual><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Intramuscular Injections><Investigation><Laboratories><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Measures><Methods><Modeling><Modern Man><Musculoskeletal Pain><Musculoskeletal Pain Disorder><Nerve Growth Factors><Neuronotrophic Factors><Neurosciences><Neurotrophic Proteins><Nociception Tests><Opiates><Opioid><Pain><Pain Assessment><Pain Measurement><Pain measure><Painful><Participant><Patients><Persistent pain><Phase><Predisposition><Prevalence><Prevention><Psychosocial Factor><Recovery><Recurrence><Recurrent><Rest><Rheumatic Diseases><Rheumatism><Rheumatologic Diseases><Rheumatologic Disorder><Risk><Severities><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Sleep><Specificity><Standardization><Stress><Susceptibility><TMJ Diseases><TMJ Disorders><TMJD><Techniques><Temporomandibular Disorders><Temporomandibular Joint Diseases><Temporomandibular Joint Disorders><Temporomandibular Joint and Muscle Disorder><Test Result><Testing><Time><Transcranial magnetic stimulation><Validation><Vulnerable Populations><Work><acute to chronic pain transition><bio-markers><biologic marker><biological signal transduction><biomarker><biomarker development><biomarker signature><biomarker validation><candidate biomarker><candidate marker><chronic MSK pain><chronic musculoskeletal pain><chronic pain><chronic pain control><chronic pain intervention><chronic pain management><chronic pain therapy><chronic pain transition><chronic pain treatment><clinical applicability><clinical application><constant pain><cost><developmental><diaries><disability><economic><effective therapy><effective treatment><experience><high risk><high risk group><high risk individual><high risk people><high risk population><human model><interest><intramuscular drug administration><lasting pain><malignancy><marker validation><model of human><neoplasm/cancer><neural imaging><neuro-imaging><neuroimaging><neurological imaging><non-narcotic analgesic><non-opiate analgesic><non-opioid><non-opioid analgesic><non-opioid therapeutics><nonnarcotic analgesics><nonopiate analgesic><nonopioid><nonopioid analgesics><novel><on-going pain><ongoing pain><pain assay><pain chronification><pain model><pain sensitivity><performance tests><predictive biomarkers><predictive marker><predictive molecular biomarker><predictive signature><prospective><psychosocial variables><resilience><resilient><social><temporomandibular pain><transition to chronic pain><treat chronic pain><validation studies><validations><vulnerable group><vulnerable individual><vulnerable people>,"Chronic Pain; Clinical Research; Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Disease; Disability Research; Neurosciences; Pain Research; Precision Medicine; Prevention; Temporomandibular Muscle/Joint Disorder (TMJD)"
Skipping the hospital: acute hospital care at home for people living with dementia,Skipping the hospital: acute hospital care at home for people living with dementia,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Skipping the hospital: Acute hospital care at home for people living with dementia
 In 2020, Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) affected 5.8 million Americans and
represented the fastest growing segment of our population.1 It was the sixth leading cause of death in the US;
1 in 3 older adults died of ADRD; and cost of care was $305 billion. A constant for people living with dementia
(PLWD) is hospitalization: PLWD are hospitalized at twice the rate as older adults without ADRD.2,3 Well-
documented is the harm of hospitalization: 1 in 3 will lose functional status; 1 in 5 will become delirious.4,5 The
harm of hospitalization is magnified in PLWD: they have 5 times the odds of an adverse event.6,7
 Acute hospital care at home (AHCaH) was specifically developed as a substitutive delivery model to
help avoid these common harms for older adults while receiving the care that they need at home. The
current model provides hospital-level care in the home after presenting to the emergency department (ED) with
an acute illness such as infection or heart failure. AHCaH includes twice daily in-home nurse visits, daily
physician visits, physical and occupational therapy, intravenous medications, biometric monitoring, in-home
diagnostics, home health aide care, and 24/7 response. Serious illness conversations (SICs) at home for
applicable patients are essential for setting goals of care and ideal given the home environment. Prior studies
including several randomized controlled trials demonstrated significant improvements in 30-day readmission,
safety, and cost.8–15 The impact on family caregivers and clinicians caring for PLWD is understudied. The
mechanism of action for home hospital is patients are more physically active, sleep better, have more days at
home in a familiar environment with improved locus of control and experience, and have less hospital-acquired
disability.”16 Home hospital care is now approved at over 296 hospitals in 37 states.
 There exists a critical need to better serve PLWD and their family caregivers when they become acutely ill.
Despite its focus on older adults, few home hospital efforts specifically target PLWD and may decline such
patients due to insufficient family caregiver support in the home, perceived risk of caring for PLWD in the
home, and lack of clear goals of care. We propose a 3-part PLWD-specific year-long pre-enrolled AHCaH
pathway: 1) in-home SIC and caregiver resourcing; 2) video and in-home acute illness evaluation on demand
including mobile integrated health paramedic and home health aide; and 3) as needed and as appropriate
AHCaH with additional ADRD resources including home health aide care and delirium prevention measures.
Our overarching aim is to implement and evaluate (NIH Stage III) an AHCaH pathway specifically for
PLWD that will serve as a national model. We will evaluate in a randomized controlled trial the effect of a pre-
enrollment AHCaH pathway on quality of life over 12 months for persons with moderate to severe dementia
(Aim 1). We will evaluate the experiences of family caregivers using a mixed-methods approach (quantitative
and qualitative) in both pre-enrolled home hospital and usual care (Aim 2).","<AD related dementia><ADRD><Accident and Emergency department><Acquired disability><Acute><Admission><Admission activity><Adverse Experience><Adverse event><Affect><Alzheimer's and related dementias><Alzheimer's disease and related dementia><Alzheimer's disease and related disorders><Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia><Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder><Alzheimer's disease or related dementia><Alzheimer's disease related dementia><Amentia><American><Asthma><Bed Sores><Bedsore><Biometrics><Biometry><Biostatistics><Bronchial Asthma><Burden on their caregivers><Bypass><COPD><Care Givers><Care giver support><Caregiver Burden><Caregiver support><Caregivers><Caring><Cause of Death><Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease><Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease><Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease><Control Locus><Delirium><Dementia><Diagnostic><Discipline of Nursing><Drugs><Emergency Department><Emergency room><Enrollment><Environment><Evaluation><Family><Family Care Giver><Family Caregiver><Goals><Health><Heart failure><Home><Home Care><Home Care Aides><Home Health Aides><Home Health Nursing><Home environment><Homemaker-Home Health Aides><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Hospitals><Infection><Interview><Intravenous><Learning><Medication><Methods><Modeling><Monitor><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Nursing><Nursing Field><Nursing Profession><Occupational Therapy><Outcome><Paramedic><Paramedical Personnel><Pathway interactions><Patients><Persons><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Physiatric Procedure><Physical Medicine Procedure><Physical Therapeutics><Physical activity><Physical therapy><Physicians><Physiotherapy><Population><Pressure Sore><Pressure Ulcer><Prevention Measures><QOL><Quality of life><Quantitative Evaluations><Randomized><Randomized, Controlled Trials><Recurrence><Recurrent><Regulatory Pathway><Research Resources><Resources><Respiratory Therapy><Risk><Safety><Services><Sleep><Societies><Structure><Survey Instrument><Surveys><Syndrome><Time><United States National Institutes of Health><Visit><Visiting Nurse><acute care><burden in caregivers><burden of their caregivers><burden on caregivers><cardiac failure><care as usual><care costs><chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder><cost><decubitus ulcer><delirious><drug/agent><enroll><experience><falls><functional status><hazard><health related quality of life><homes><hospital care><hospital re-admission><hospital readmission><improved><mortality><older adult><older adulthood><pandemic><pandemic disease><pathway><patient home care><patient homecare><pressure injury><randomisation><randomization><randomized control trial><randomly assigned><re-admission><re-hospitalization><readmission><rehospitalization><remote assessment><remote evaluation><response><treatment as usual><usual care>",Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Caregiving Research; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Dementia; Emergency Care; Health Services; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Palliative Care; Rehabilitation
"Prediction, mechanisms and causality: a systems biology approach to elucidate the role of the dynamic interplay between maternal and microbial systems in the pathobiology of perinatal depression","Prediction, mechanisms and causality: a systems biology approach to elucidate the role of the dynamic interplay between maternal and microbial systems in the pathobiology of perinatal depression","PROJECT SUMMARY
Perinatal depression (PND), defined as depression during pregnancy and up to one year postpartum, affects
more than 20% of pregnancies and disproportionately impacts Black Women and Latinas. PND increases risk
of preterm birth and infant neurodevelopment deficits. Yet we still do not fully understand the pathobiology of
PND, which limits efforts to improve its prevention, identification and treatment. Interactions between the host
and microbial communities that reside in the gut are essential for human health. Gut microorganisms play an
important role in producing beneficial metabolites, including the neurotransmitters serotonin and gamma-
aminobutyric acid (GABA). The gut microbiota bidirectionally communicate with the brain, an interaction
mediated by the neurological, immune, and endocrine systems and coined as the microbiota-gut-brain axis
(MGBA). Our initial pilot results from a longitudinal study of low-income women of color (n=42) early in pregnancy,
which showed that multiple attributes of the MGBA were associated with depressive symptom severity, including
production of short chain fatty-acids, metabolism of tryptophan and GABA, and systemic inflammation mediated
by bile acid metabolism. Although our initial data points to new MGBA signatures linked to depressive symptom
severity in the first and second trimesters, additional work is needed to determine whether these signatures and
their interactions extend beyond the second trimester. Further, microbial metabolism is driven both by the
interactions between metabolites and by the interplay between microbial metabolic systems with maternal
inflammatory system and metabolism. Thus, determining the causal influence of these new MGBA signatures
on depressive symptom severity during the perinatal period requires using approaches that can establish the
effect of systems (networks) coupling in MGBA functioning. Here, we propose a clinical translational study to
determine the role of MGBA in PND by using a systems biology framework and an experimental animal model
to assess causality. To test this, we will draw from our research infrastructure to recruit 158 women (55% Black,
30% Latina) early in pregnancy (<16 gestational weeks) and follow them bimonthly for up to 6 weeks postpartum.
We will assess mood; lifestyle (diet, physical activity, sleep); and heart-rate variability (a proxy for stress) and
will measure microbial genome and meta-metabolome and maternal blood transcriptome and metabolome. In
Aim 1, we will employ interpretable machine learning models to predict depressive symptom severity
concurrently and prospectively. In Aim 2, we will establish coupling mechanisms that regulate symptom severity
by modeling the interplay between microbial and maternal metabolic, genetic and regulatory systems using
network theory. In Aim 3, we will determine the causal role of gut microbiota in symptom severity in a female
pregnant germ-free mouse model using fecal microbiota transplants. Our paradigm-shifting data-driven proposal
will identify host-microbial features predictive of perinatal depressive symptom severity and modifiable risk
factors for prevention and treatment of PND, with causality tested in animal models.","<1st trimester><2-amino-ethanesulfonic acid><2nd trimester><4-Aminobutanoic Acid><4-Aminobutyric Acid><4-amino-butanoic acid><5-HT><5-Hydroxytryptamine><5HT><Affect><Alimentary Canal><Aminalon><Aminalone><Aminobutyric Acids><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Bayesian Network><Behavior><Bile Acids><Biochemical Pathway><Birth><Black><Black race><Blood><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Blood Sample><Blood Serum><Blood specimen><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Breast Feeding><Breast fed><Breastfed><Breastfeeding><Causality><Characteristics><Coin><Communication><Corpus Luteum Hormone><Coupling><Data><Delta4-pregnene-3,20-dione><Development><Diet><Digestive Tract><Disease><Disorder><Early Placental Phase><Elements><Emotional Depression><Encephalon><Endocrine Gland Secretion><Endocrine system><Endocrine/Metabolic Organ System><Enteramine><Ethnic Origin><Ethnicity><Etiology><Experimental Animal Model><Expression Signature><Family><Feces><Female><First Pregnancy Trimester><First Trimester><Functional Metagenomics><Future><GABA><GI Tract><GI microbiota><Gastrointestinal Tract><Gastrointestinal microbiota><Gastrointestinal tract structure><Gene Expression Profile><Genetic><Germ-Free><Gestation><Health><High Risk Woman><Hippophaine><Hormonal System><Hormones><Human><Immune><Immune system><Immunes><Infant><Inflammatory><Intermediary Metabolism><Interpretable ML><Interpretable machine learning><L-Tryptophan><Latina><Latina Population><Latinas><Levotryptophan><Life Style><Lifestyle><Link><Longitudinal Studies><Low income><Machine Learning><Measures><Mediating><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Mental disorders><Mental health disorders><Metabolic><Metabolic Networks><Metabolic Processes><Metabolic/Endocrine Body System><Metabolism><Metagenomics><Mice><Mice Mammals><Midtrimester><Modeling><Modern Man><Moods><Morbidity><Morbidity -

Theoretically Informed Behavioral Intervention to Enhance QOL and Prevent HIV-related Comorbidities in Ethnic and Racial Sexual Minority Men,Theoretically Informed Behavioral Intervention to Enhance QOL and Prevent HIV-related Comorbidities in Ethnic and Racial Sexual Minority Men,"ABSTRACT
Black and Hispanic men are at highest risk of comorbid conditions resulting from HIV. Cardiovascular disease has become the leading contributor to mortality among persons with HIV, as both conditions are often co-morbid. As a result, prominent HIV comorbid conditions include CVD, high blood pressure and type II diabetes mellitus. Compared with the general population, CVD risk is 1.5 to 2 times higher in people with HIV, and this risk increases with age. By the year 2030, an estimated 78% of persons with HIV will be 50 years old or older, and nearly 80% will have one or more chronic conditions. These overlapping health needs drive up the cost of care as total direct expenditures for HIV treatment in the US exceed those for persons without HIV by approximately $10.7 billion and cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities further increase this financial burden. Increased risk of HIV-related comorbidities, such as heart disease, is driven by environmental and interpersonal factors that contribute to nicotine exposure, poor diet quality, low physical activity, insufficient sleep, high cholesterol levels, elevated blood pressure, high blood sugar, and increased body mass index. Even when HIV viral load is well-controlled, HIV-infection causes immune activation and chronic inflammation, which can cause a narrowing of blood vessels, and can result in high blood pressure, chest pain, and/or buildup of plaque in the heart, ultimately resulting in heart disease. The status quo as it pertains to traditional chronic illness prevention has been conventional patient teaching in the clinical setting. However, prevention efforts to reduce heart disease have not achieved population-level impact and have been less effective among persons with HIV. The LEARN Study was a pilot waitlist control trial testing a virtual environment for CVD and metabolic disease prevention education. Our LEARN findings suggested that participants are concerned about hypertension, type II diabetes, stroke, and cancer. Cancer risk reflected both the increased incidence of non–AIDS-defining malignancies among people with HIV and shared risk factors for cardiovascular comorbidities. We propose a follow-up study to these findings in LEARN 2 using innovative clinical and community collaboration, a multidisciplinary team, and a virtual environment designed to preemptively mitigate HIV‐related comorbidities with shared risk factors. Project objectives are to: 1) to utilize formative research to modify our intervention to address contextual factors that affect prevention of shared clinical risk factors for HIV‐comorbidities; 2) determine the efficacy of LEARN2, as prevention education for HIV-comorbidities; and 3) conduct a process evaluation of LEARN2 feasibility and acceptability, identifying which components are most successful in initiating change. This project represents a shift in the status quo and signifies a trailblazing effort that leverages a multidisciplinary team, virtual tools, and clinical and community collaborations to advance health optimization in populations experiencing health disparities, while informing research, clinical practice, and policy.",<AIDS><AIDS Virus><AIDS prevention><Acquired Immune Deficiency><Acquired

Utilizing the NHANES-Linked Medicaid Data to Understand the Role of Preconception Lifestyle Factors on Pregnancy Outcomes,Utilizing the NHANES-Linked Medicaid Data to Understand the Role of Preconception Lifestyle Factors on Pregnancy Outcomes,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although lifestyle factors have been investigated for their potential to modify risk of adverse pregnancy
outcomes, initiating interventions during pregnancy may not have the greatest impact. Therefore, it is crucial to
focus on preconception interventions to support healthy placental development and reduce the risk of
metabolic conditions. However, there is a lack of data regarding the optimal timing and strategies for
preconception health to improve pregnancy outcomes. Physical activity, diet, and sleep play pivotal roles in
preconception care as they influence metabolic health and body weight regulation, which can impact the
subsequent risk of pregnancy complications. Existing preconception care often emphasizes weight loss, but
there is limited evidence on the most effective amounts and strategies for improving later pregnancy health.
Moreover, using body mass index as the primary measure for obesity classification may misidentify individuals
who would benefit the most from weight loss, as it fails to distinguish between lean mass, fat mass, and fat
distribution. Methodological challenges in studying preconception exposures have hindered the establishment
of a robust evidence base for optimizing pregnancy health. To address these gaps, we propose an innovative
approach utilizing the linkage between the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) and Medicaid data.
With this data examine pregnancy outcomes among low-income reproductive-aged women who become
pregnant and utilize Medicaid services following their NHANES assessment. Medicaid covers a substantial
portion of U.S. births, making studies of Medicaid-covered pregnancies highly generalizable. Leveraging the
NHANES-Medicaid data as a ""preconception cohort,"" we will investigate the impact of preconception
exposures on pregnancy outcomes. Employing advanced epidemiological methods to minimize selection bias
and improve generalizability, we will apply a target trial framework to assess preconception strategies for
optimizing pregnancy outcomes. The comprehensive phenotyping data available in NHANES will enable robust
assessment of confounding variables, reducing the impact of unmeasured confounders and mimicking
randomized trials of lifestyle factors. Using NHANES-assessed exposures, we will evaluate the influence of
preconception dietary patterns, physical activity, sleep, body composition, and weight loss attempts and

Determining true versus apparent treatment-resistant hypertension among African Americans in the Jackson Heart Study,Determining true versus apparent treatment-resistant hypertension among African Americans in the Jackson Heart Study,"Abstract
African Americans (AAs) have a high prevalence of hypertension and suffer a disproportionately
high risk for cardiovascular disease compared to whites. Apparent treatment-resistant
hypertension (aTRH) is a severe form of hypertension defined as requiring ≥ 4 antihypertensive
medications to achieve blood pressure (BP) control. An estimated 9 million US adults have
aTRH. Given the rigorous clinical work-up needed to rule out pseudoresistance and therefore,
diagnose true TRH, the population prevalence of TRH is not known. We propose an ancillary
study to the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), a large prospective cohort of AA adults (n=5,306) that
will deeply phenotype participants with aTRH, ruling out pseudoresistance (i.e., inaccurate clinic
BP measurement, presence of a white coat effect, suboptimal antihypertensive therapy, and
poor medication adherence) and secondary causes of hypertension (i.e., primary aldosteronism,
obstructive sleep apnea, and kidney disease). The JHS provides a highly feasible setting for
the proposed study as it includes a large population of AAs with a high prevalence of
hypertension and extensive data collection as part of an upcoming fourth parent study visit,
which will facilitate the screening and recruitment of participants for our ancillary study. Based
on data collected during the fourth JHS exam, we will identify 400 participants with aTRH and
200 treatment-responsive controls. These participants will undergo a clinical evaluation for TRH
including assessment of existing ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) data to detect white coat
effect and urinalysis of antihypertensive drugs and metabolites to assess medication adherence.
Also, participants with aTRH will be compared to treatment responsive controls with respect to
secondary causes of hypertension and lifestyle factors. Clinical translation of the study findings
will be facilitated by an external panel of experts who co-authored the American Heart
Association 2018 Scientific Statement on Resistant Hypertension. Overall, the diagnosis and
treatment of TRH is limited by our understanding of pseudoresistance and other factors
underlying aTRH. The proposed study is urgently needed to more efficiently diagnose and
better treat this severe form of hypertension among African Americans.","<21+ years old><Adherence><Adult><Adult Human><Adverse Experience><Adverse event><African American><African American group><African American individual><African American people><African American population><African Americans><Afro American><Afroamerican><Aldosteronism><Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring><American Heart Association><Ancillary Study><Anti-Hypertensive Agents><Anti-Hypertensive Drugs><Anti-Hypertensives><Anti-Inflammatories><Anti-Inflammatory Agents><Anti-inflammatory><Award><BP control><BP management><Blood Pressure><Chronic Kidney Failure><Chronic Renal Disease><Chronic Renal Failure><Clinic><Clinic Visits><Clinical><Clinical Evaluation><Clinical Testing><Coronary Disease><Coronary heart disease><Data><Data Collection><Diabetes Mellitus><Diagnosis><Disparities><Disparity><Drugs><Enrollment><Evaluation><Funding><Future><Grant><Health><Healthcare><Heavy Drinking><High Prevalence><Hyperaldosteronism><Hypertension><Hypotensive Agent><Hypotensive Drugs><Individual><Infrastructure><Intake><Investigators><Jackson Heart Study><Kidney><Kidney Diseases><Kidney Urinary System><Knowledge><Measurement><Medication><Na element><Nephropathy><Obesity><Obstructive Sleep Apnea><Organ><Outcome><Parents><Participant><Patient Recruitments><Patients><Pattern><Persons><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phenotype><Population><Prevalence><Prognosis><Prospective cohort><Prospective, cohort study><Racial Group><Regimen><Renal Disease><Research Personnel><Research Resources><Researchers><Resistant Hypertension><Resources><Respiration Disorders><Respiratory Disorder><Risk><Risk Factors><Role><Secondary to><Sleep><Sodium><Syndrome, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive><Urinalysis><Vascular Hypertensive Disease><Vascular Hypertensive Disorder><Visit><adiposity><adulthood><anti-hypertension><atherosclerotic heart disease><blood pressure control><blood pressure elevation><blood pressure management><breathing disorder><cardiovascular disease risk><cardiovascular disorder risk><chronic kidney disease><clinical diagnosis><clinical test><clinical translation><clinically translatable><comparator group><comparison group><coronary disorder><corpulence><diabetes><diagnostic algorithm><diet and exercise><disparities in race><disparity due to race><drink heavily><drug adherence><drug compliance><drug/agent><elevated blood pressure><enroll><excessive alcohol consumption><excessive alcohol ingestion><excessive alcohol intake><excessive drinking><excessive ethanol ingestion><extreme drinking><health care><heavy alcohol use><high blood pressure><high risk><hyperpiesia><hyperpiesis><hypertensive disease><hypertensive disorder><improved><increase in blood pressure><increased blood pressure><inequality due to race><inequity due to race><kidney disorder><lack of physical activity><life-style factor><lifestyle factors><medication adherence><medication compliance><mortality><over-treatment><overtreatment><parent><participant recruitment><physical inactivity><race based disparity><race based inequality><race based inequity><race disparity><race related disparity><race related inequality><race related inequity><racial disparity><racial inequality><racial inequity><racial population><racial subgroup><racially unequal><recruit><renal><renal disorder><research clinical testing><respiratory dysfunction><response to therapy><response to treatment><screening><screenings><social role><therapeutic response><therapy response><translational study><treatment response><treatment responsiveness><unhealthy lifestyle><wasting>",Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Hypertension; Racial and Ethnic Minority Health Research
Effect of support for low-income mothers of preterm infants on parental caregiving in the NICU,Effect of support for low-income mothers of preterm infants on parental caregiving in the NICU,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Preterm birth is the leading cause of childhood mortality and developmental disabilities and costs $26 billion
annually. A critical modifier of preterm infant health and development is maternal presence during the birth
hospitalization, which facilitates breast milk provision, participation in skin-to-skin care and allows mothers to
benefit from training in post-discharge infant care practices. However, these benefits can only be realized if
mothers are able to visit their hospitalized preterm infants for several hours per day, actively engage in
caregiving and receive training from staff during the many weeks of a typical preterm birth hospitalization.
Regularly visiting a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) requires mothers to shoulder significant costs, including
parking, childcare for other children, transportation, and accommodations, in addition to forgoing income.
Moreover, new evidence suggests that the psychological burden of financial strain may worsen mental health
outcomes (including stress and depression) and impede cognitive functions such as attention, memory, and
inhibitory control, which may further impede low-income mothers’ participation in NICU caregiving. Building on
a feasibility trial conducted by our team, we propose to conduct a 1:1 randomized control trial to rigorously test
the impact of financial transfers versus standard of care (control) among 420 low-income mothers with infants
25-33 weeks’ gestation in 3 level 3 NICUs (1 urban, 1 urban/suburban and 1 suburban/rural). Mothers in the
intervention arm will receive a transfer of $160 per hospital week with a one-time “label” or scripted message
that explains that the transfer is intended for them to visit and care for their hospitalized infant. Our primary
hypothesis is that financial transfers can enable economically disadvantaged families to visit the NICU, reduce
the negative psychological impacts of financial distress, increase maternal caregiving behaviors associated
with positive preterm infant health and development and potentially reduce health systems costs. In Aim 1, we
will examine the impact of financial transfers on primary NICU caregiving behaviors --breastmilk provision and
skin-to-skin care-- and secondary 1-2 month post-discharge caregiving behaviors-- safe sleep practices. In Aim
2, we will consider mechanisms of action, including mediators (NICU visitation, mental health, and cognitive
function) of the relationship between financial transfers and caregiving behaviors of interest. We will also
qualitatively explore maternal perspectives of financial transfers, mediators of its impact, and other barriers and
facilitators to maternal caregiving. In Aim 3, we will conduct exploratory analysis of cost drivers (length of stay,
30-day readmission and ED use). This simple and scalable intervention has tremendous potential to improve
equity in health care access by enabling key populations to utilize existing clinical supports during the NICU
hospitalization.","<0-11 years old><Accident and Emergency department><Acute><Address><Adherence><Attention><Back to Sleep><Behavior><Birth><Breast Feeding><Breast Milk><Breast fed><Breastfed><Breastfeeding><Breastmilk><Caring><Child><Child Care><Child Development><Child Development Disorders><Child Health><Child Youth><Childhood><Children (0-21)><Clinical><Control Groups><Cost Analyses><Cost Analysis><Decrease health disparities><Development><Developmental Disabilities><Disparities><Disparity><Economic Income><Economical Income><Economically Deprived><Emergency Department><Emergency room><Equity><Failure><Family><Financial Hardship><Gestation><Health><Health Benefit><Health Care Utilization><Health Promotion><Health disparity mitigation><Health disparity reduction><Health system><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Hospitals><Hour><Human Milk><Human Mother's Milk><Incidence><Income><Infant><Infant Care><Infant Development><Infant Health><Infant and Child Development><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Label><Length of Stay><Link><Location><Low income><Lower health disparities><Mammary Gland Milk><Massachusetts><Mediating><Mediator><Medicaid eligibility><Medical Care Costs><Memory><Mental Depression><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Mitigate health disparities><Modeling><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Mother's Milk><Mothers><Neonatal Intensive Care Units><Neural Development><Newborn Intensive Care Units><Number of Days in Hospital><Outcome><Parturition><Physiologic><Physiological><Pilot Projects><Population><Pregnancy><Premature Birth><Premature Infant><Prematurely delivering><Preterm Birth><Psychological Health><Psychological Impact><Puericulture><QOC><Quality of Care><Randomization trial><Randomized, Controlled Trials><Reduce health disparities><Reporting><Research><Risk><Rural><SES disparity><Safe Sleep><Safe to Sleep Campaign><Salutogenesis><Shoulder><Skin><Skin Care><Stress><Testing><Time><Training><Transportation><United States><Visit><access to health care><access to healthcare><accessibility of health care><accessibility to health care><accessibility to healthcare><arm><assess cost><baby care><breast pump><care as usual><care giving><caregiving><cognitive function><cost><cost assessment><cost evaluation><depression><developmental><economic disparity><economically disadvantaged><effectiveness testing><enhanced care><evaluate cost><examine cost><feasibility trial><financial adversity><financial burden><financial distress><financial insecurity><financial strain><financial stress><group intervention><health care access><health care availability><health care service access><health care service availability><health care service use><health care service utilization><healthcare access><healthcare accessibility><healthcare availability><healthcare service access><healthcare service availability><healthcare service use><healthcare service utilization><healthcare utilization><hospital days><hospital length of stay><hospital re-admission><hospital readmission><hospital stay><improved><incomes><infant health care><infant healthcare><infants born premature><infants born prematurely><innovate><innovation><innovative><interest><intervention arm><interventional strategy><kids><lower income families><maternal care giving><maternal caregiving><maternal milk><medical costs><medical expenses><milk production><mortality><neonatal ICU><neurodevelopment><newborn care><pediatric><pilot study><premature baby><premature childbirth><premature delivery><premature infant human><preterm baby><preterm delivery><preterm infant><preterm infant human><primary outcome><produce milk><program costs><programs><promoting health><psychologic><psychological><randomized control trial><randomized trial><re-admission><re-hospitalization><readmission><rehospitalization><secondary outcome><sleep position><socio-economic disparity><socio-economic inequality><socio-economic inequity><socioeconomic disparity><socioeconomic inequality><socioeconomic inequity><standard care><standard of care><standard treatment><suburb><suburban><suburbia><treatment arm><treatment as usual><usual care><youngster>","Behavioral and Social Science; Breastfeeding, Lactation and Breast Milk; Caregiving Research; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Health Services; Infant Mortality; Mental Health; Patient Safety; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Social Determinants of Health; Sudden Infant Death Syndrome; Women's Health Research"
Investigating reciprocal interactions between circuit and synaptic function,Investigating reciprocal interactions between circuit and synaptic function,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The patterns of connectivity across the neural networks of the brain play a critical role in determining how
those networks function. However, the mechanisms through which the architecture of a circuit supports
information encoding or storage remain unclear. In addition, circuit-level activity patterns drive changes in the
strength of synapses across that circuit, which in turn necessarily alters how the circuit behaves. While
considerable work has elucidated many cellular and molecular components of synaptic plasticity, the precise
reciprocal interaction between in vivo activity patterns, synaptic plasticity, and circuit level function remains
unclear. The brain expresses several distinct types of internally generated sequences of neuronal activity
independent of external sensory stimuli, and such temporally precise, self-organized sequences play a crucial
role in information processing and memory formation/retrieval. Due to their independence from external inputs,
internally generated sequences serve as a powerful model to explore the fundamental relationship between the
connectome and network function. The hippocampus, a brain area critical for the formation of many types of
memory, generates a well-defined type of neuronal sequence, sharp-wave/ripple (SWR)-associated replay,
which is observed during “offline” states such as rest or sleep. The central objectives of this proposal are to
identify the in vivo connectome architecture of the hippocampal network, quantify how these connection
patterns regulate activity across the circuit during active “online” encoding and during “offline” SWR
sequences, measure how in vivo activity patterns across this neural network change the weights of synaptic
connections, and establish how those synaptic changes in turn impact circuit function. Supported by
considerable preliminary data, these ambitious aims will be achieved through a combination of ultra-high
density, large-scale in vivo electrophysiology followed by in-depth computational analysis of the resulting data,
and rapid in vivo optical labeling of active neural populations followed by ex vivo physiological quantification of
synaptic function. In Aim 1, we will directly test two models with differing predictions regarding the impact of
local hippocampal connectivity on place field distribution and activity patterns during SWRs. In Aim 2, we will
test the hypothesis that coordinated activity of synaptically connected neuron pairs during behavior (e.g.,
overlapping place fields) potentiates their synaptic connections, which in turn impacts the content of
subsequent SWRs. In Aim 3, we will directly quantify the synaptic consequences of in vivo activity via whole
cell electrophysiology performed in neurons which were either active or silent in an immediately prior
experience. Together, this study is expected to meaningfully advance our understanding of circuit-level brain
function by revealing the fundamental principles which allow precise patterns of activity to be dynamically
generated and propagated throughout the hippocampal network in support of learning.",<Acute><Ammon Horn><Architecture><Area><Behavior><Body Weight Changes><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Brain region><Cell Body><Cells><Chronic><Cognitive><Complex><Computer Analysis><Cornu Ammonis><Data><Distant><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Encephalon><Engineering / Architecture><Environment><Experimental Models><Future><Generations><Goals><Hippocampus><Human><Knowledge><Label><Learning><Link><Location><Maps><Measures><Memory><Methods><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neurologic Disorders><Neurological Disorders><Neurons><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Neurosciences Research><Optics><Pathologic><Pattern><Physiologic><Physiological><Play><Population><Process><Recurrence><Recurrent><Research><Rest><Retrieval><Role><Sleep><Slice><Synapses><Synaptic><Synaptic plasticity><System><Testing><Time><Weight><Weight Change><Work><computational analyses><computational analysis><computer analyses><connectome><density><electrophysiological><experience><flexibility><flexible><hippocampal><in vivo><information processing><memory consolidation><memory process><memory processing><memory retrieval><neural><neural network><neurological disease><neuronal><novel><optical><perceptual stimulus><physicochemical phenomena related to the senses><place fields><self organization><sensory input><sensory stimulus><social role><spatial memory><synapse><synapse function><synaptic function><virtual><weights>,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Neurosciences
A Longitudinal Examination of the Social and Environmental Influences on Substance Use among Non-Prescriber/Non-Executive Healthcare Workers in the United States,A Longitudinal Examination of the Social and Environmental Influences on Substance Use among Non-Prescriber/Non-Executive Healthcare Workers in the United States,"Healthcare workers represent a large and growing segment of the US workforce, and the strain of the COVID-
19 pandemic on the healthcare system has brought to light the significant stress, trauma, and burnout that
healthcare workers experience. These experiences may have lasting effects on healthcare workers’ substance
use, mental health symptomatology, and suicidality, particularly among those in lower-wage occupations. These
workers often have fewer supports and resources, less autonomy in the workplace (e.g., scheduling/hours
worked, workload), and experience greater occupational hazards than their higher-earning counterparts yet
remain highly understudied. Most of the published studies related to substance use, mental health
symptomatology, and suicidality among healthcare workers have disproportionately focused on physicians and
other high-wage healthcare occupations. The objective of the proposed research is to examine the social and
environmental influences on the substance use, mental health symptomatology, and suicidality of non-
prescriber/non-executive healthcare workers over time, with particular attention to the effects of moral injury (i.e.,
psychosocial and behavioral impacts of “failing to prevent or bearing witness to acts that transgress deeply held
moral beliefs and expectations”) and workplace policies, programs, and practices. The rationale for the proposed
research is that identification of factors beyond the individual level that confer risk or protection to healthcare
workers’ substance use, mental health symptomatology, and suicidality can inform the development of more
effective prevention and intervention efforts, particularly as it relates to the implementation of psychosocially safe
and healthy workplace practices. Individual-level explanations for people’s risk and resilience to substance use,
mental health symptomatology, and suicidality remain dominant in the scientific literature. However, we will also
focus on interpersonal, organizational, community, and societal factors – and their intersections with
socioeconomic positioning – that affect the health, well-being, and risk for substance use, substance-related
harms, and substance use disorders among healthcare workers. This research proposes to 1) examine the
effects of moral injury on changes in substance use, substance use disorders, problematic mental health
symptomatology, and suicidality; 2) examine the impact of other individual, social, and environmental factors on
these outcomes over time; and 3) examine the unique impacts of workplace policies, programs, and practices
on the risk and resilience of healthcare workers. We will pursue these aims using an innovative approach and
unique focus. The proposed research will examine a diverse sample of healthcare workers recruited via social
media, including low-wage healthcare support occupations (e.g., nursing assistants, dietary aides, custodians).
The proposed research is significant because the examination of factors external to the individual will identify
modifiable social and environmental risk factors that are more efficient and effective intervention targets, given
the broad impacts of population-level interventions.",<21+ years old><Active Follow-up><Address><Administrator><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><Alcohol Drinking><Alcohol consumption><Ambulatory Care

"Cannabidiol for postoperative Opioid Reduction in primary total Knee arthroplasty – a randomized, 2x2 factorial, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (The CORK trial)","Cannabidiol for postoperative Opioid Reduction in primary total Knee arthroplasty – a randomized, 2x2 factorial, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (The CORK trial)","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Knee osteoarthritis is a very common and debilitating condition, affecting >14 million Americans. Many people
with knee osteoarthritis require total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to treat pain and improve function, and opioids
remain the primary modality for treatment of pain after TKA. However, opioids carry significant side effects,
with ~80% of surgical patients reporting at least one moderate or severe side effect (e.g. nausea, dizziness,
constipation). Moreover, perioperative opioid exposure is associated with patients becoming dependent on
opioids long after surgical recovery, and new chronic opioid dependence is subsequently associated with
increased healthcare costs, the development of opioid use disorder (addiction), overdose, and death. Hence,
research into opioid alternatives for postoperative pain is of critical importance. Cannabinoids,
including
cannabidiol (CBD), are one class of potential opioid-sparing pain medications. While CBD is used by an
estimated 14% of the general public, most frequently for chronic pain and related symptoms (including as an
opioid substitute), rigorous clinical research on CBD is limited. CBD shows great promise, as it is non-
intoxicating, and reduces pain, anxiety and inflammation in animal studies. Previous research has found that
CBD reduced opioid craving and anxiety, which further suggests it may decrease opioid use after surgery. It is
also well tolerated across numerous medical conditions. Moreover, CBD (Epidiolex), the study drug we will
use, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating some seizure disorders, and it is not subject
to the same regulatory restrictions as
Δ
-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In this study, we will recruit 380 patients
undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) from two large health systems. In this multi-site, 2x2 factorial,
double-blind, randomized controlled trial, participants will receive one of four combinations of placebo or CBD
(300 mg/day) for one week prior to surgery together with CBD or placebo for 4 weeks following surgery. Our
primary outcome will be post-operative opioid consumption in the 4-week period following surgery. The study
design will also allow us to investigate and untangle CBD's pre- and post-surgical effects, including reduction
of anxiety, sleep disturbance and inflammation. We will also conduct detailed investigations of the side effects
and adverse events, as well as pharmacokinetics of CBD throughout the treatment course. The successful
completion of this study will give much needed evidence for the role of CBD as an opioid-sparing medication

findings could have much broader implications beyond TKA and would motivate important new lines of

Molecular Mechanisms of Potassium Channel Permeation and Gating,Molecular Mechanisms of Potassium Channel Permeation and Gating,"ABSTRACT
Potassium (K+) channels are major determinants of cell excitability and play crucial roles in physiological
processes. Large conductance and Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels, have the ability to couple intracellular
Ca2+ to membrane potential variations, play major physiological roles in vascular smooth muscle tone
maintenance, regulation of circadian rhythms, hearing, neurotransmitter release. BK channels can associate
with tissue-specific accessory subunits, endowing the channels with different functional properties. b2 and b3
subunits induce N-type (or ball-and-chain) inactivation of the otherwise non-inactivating BK channels. BK
channel dysfunction has been associated with many pathophysiological conditions, so understanding how they
gate can have major therapeutic consequences. In the previous grant cycle, we determined the structural
correlates of gating and ball-and-chain inactivation in K+ channels, using a prokaryotic homolog of BK
channels, MthK, from Methanotropicum thermoautotrophicum. We also found that lipid bilayer thickness
strongly affects MthK inactivation. Unlike BK, MthK channels inactivate using an intrinsic N-terminal “ball”
domain, similar to Shaker K+ channels. The overall objective of this grant is to determine the structural
correlates of ball-and-chain inactivation in BK channels and understand how lipids modulate inactivation in
both MthK and BK. Since membrane lipid composition cannot be controlled in cells, we will use a bottom-up
approach of purified channels in reconstituted systems to rigorously control lipid composition. We will use
structural, functional, and computational analysis (the last with a collaborator, see letter) on both MthK and BK
channels to reach these goals. Our first aim is to determine the mechanism by which lipids modulate ball-and-
chain inactivation in MthK. Our hypothesis, predicted by MD simulations, is that thicker bilayers bind the
amphipathic ball domain better than thinner bilayers, which will be tested with mutagenesis of the ball domain,
constructs with different chain lengths, and membrane manipulations. This aim was proposed in the previous
grant cycle, we made considerable progress but the mechanism was more complex than anticipated. Hence,
this aim still needs investigation. During the last cycle, we also treated another unexpected finding from the
structure of closed MthK, still in the scope of the grant but not explicitly proposed, which was just published.
Our second aim is to determine the structural correlates of ball-and-chain inactivation in BK channels as well
as how bilayer-thickness and other bilayer properties modulate these channels. We will use b2 and a chimeric
b4-b2 subunit for both structural studies and electrophysiology in HEK cells and liposomes. We will investigate
lipid-dependence of BK channel gating with and without b subunits with stopped-flow assays and single-
channel recordings of purified BK channels reconstituted in liposomes. Channel structures in complex with
lipids will be solved using cryo-EM. The accomplishment of these aims will provide a comprehensive picture of
ball-and-chain inactivation and lipid modulation in calcium-gated potassium channels.",<AD dementia><Affect><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><Assay><Asthma><BK channels><Big K channels><Binding><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Body Tissues><Bronchial Asthma><Ca2+-Activated K+ Channels><Calcium><Calcium Binding><Calcium-Activated K+ Channels><Calcium-Activated Potassium Channel><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Membrane Lipids><Cell Signaling><Cell membrane><Cells><Charge><Circadian Rhythms><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Complex><Computer Analysis><Cryo-electron Microscopy><Cryoelectron Microscopy><Cytoplasmic Membrane><Defect><Dependence><Detergents><Disease><Disorder><Disturbance in cognition><Drug Targeting><Dysfunction><Electron Cryomicroscopy><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Electrostatics><Endowment><Epilepsy><Epileptic Seizures><Epileptics><Functional disorder><GeneHomolog><Genetics-Mutagenesis><Goals><Grant><Hearing><Homolog><Homologous Gene><Homologue><Human><Hypertension><Impaired cognition><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigation><Ion Channel><Ionic Channels><Ions><K channel><K element><Kidney><Kidney Urinary System><Leanness><Length><Letters><Ligands><Lipid Bilayers><Lipids><Liposomal><Liposomes><Maintenance><MaxiK channels><Measures><Mechanical Stress><Membrane><Membrane Channels><Membrane Lipids><Membrane Potentials><Membrane Protein Gene><Membrane Proteins><Membrane-Associated Proteins><Modern Man><Molecular><Molecular Interaction><Muscle Tonus><Mutagenesis><Mutagenesis Molecular Biology><N-terminal><NH2-terminal><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Neutralization Tests><Nyctohemeral Rhythm><Organism><Organism-Level Process><Organismal Process><Peptides><Phenotype><Physiologic><Physiologic Processes><Physiological><Physiological Processes><Physiology><Physiopathology><Plasma Membrane><Play><Potassium><Potassium Channel><Potassium Ion Channels><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Property><Publishing><Resting Potentials><Role><Seizure Disorder><Shaker potassium channel><Shaker protein><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Sleep Disorders><Sodium Chloride><Stimulus><Structure><Surface Proteins><System><TM Domain><Testing><Therapeutic><Thick><Thickness><Thinness><Tissues><Transmembrane Domain><Transmembrane Potentials><Transmembrane Region><Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm><Variant><Variation><Vascular Hypertensive Disease><Vascular Hypertensive Disorder><Vascular Smooth Muscle><antibody neutralization test><biological signal transduction><calcium bound><circadian process><circadian regulation><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive loss><computational analyses><computational analysis><computer analyses><cryo-EM><cryoEM><cryogenic electron microscopy><daily biorhythm><electrophysiological><epilepsia><epileptogenic><high blood pressure><hyperpiesia><hyperpiesis><hypertensive disease><hypertensive disorder><intervention design><large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels><lipid bilayer membrane><living system><maxi-K channels><membrane structure><muscle tone><nanodisk><neurotransmitter release><particle><pathophysiology><plasmalemma><primary degenerative dementia><reconstitute><reconstitution><renal><response><salt><screening><screenings><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><simulation><sleep diseases><sleep dysfunction><sleep illness><sleep problem><slowpoke protein><social role><success><therapy design><treatment design>,Neurosciences
"The Collaboration Linking Opioid Use Disorder and Sleep (""CLOUDS"") Study","The Collaboration Linking Opioid Use Disorder and Sleep (""CLOUDS"") Study","PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic and relapsing brain disease that is characterized by loss of control over
opioid use. It affects over 2 million Americans and causes one overdose death every 20-minutes. Despite
effective evidence-based treatments in the form of both behavioral interventions and FDA-approved medication
for addiction treatment (MAT), relapse rates are high and are associated with lack of retention in treatment and
a continued cycle of illicit opioid use. Further research is urgently needed to better understand the mechanisms
that contribute to ongoing illicit opioid use and poor retention in MAT and identify novel treatments. In response
to RFA-HL-19-029 and its call to conduct “mechanistic studies to determine the directionality of sleep and OUD
interactions in humans… and to identify new opportunities for prevention and improved therapy,” The
Collaboration Linking Opioid Use Disorder and Sleep (“CLOUDS”) Study will investigate patients on MAT to
elucidate potential causal mechanisms between sleep deficiency and OUD. We will conduct an observational
cohort study of N= 220 patients with OUD who were recently stabilized on MAT at a large opioid treatment
program in New Haven, CT. At baseline, all patients will undergo: (1) comprehensive assessments of sleep and
circadian rhythmicity (i.e., polysomnography, melatonin onset/offset, wrist actigraphy, and validated sleep and
circadian surveys); (2) a task-enriched functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) functional connectivity
protocol; (3) blood assays for measures of stress and sex hormones; (4) neuro-clinical status using validated
interviews, and surveys; and (5) physical home microenvironment and psychosocial family assessments.
Patients will be followed for 6 months for the primary outcome of % days of illicit opioid use. In this context, we
will pursue several specific aims. Aim1: Using fMRI network analyses, test whether there are different
neurocognitive connectivity patterns between patients with adequate vs. deficient sleep in brain systems involved
in addiction (e.g., executive function, reward processing) and assess the extent to which these “neural
fingerprints” predict ongoing opioid use. Aim 2: Evaluate the potential biologic, psychiatric, and pharmacologic
mechanisms that explain the causal pathway between sleep deficiency and opioid use by analyzing the
mediating effect of other selected known OUD risk factors including stress, pain, negative affect, and other
substance use. Aim 3: Test the extent to which ecologic factors such as psychosocial, family, and neighborhood
contextual factors associated with OUD contribute to sleep deficiency among patients in MAT. An experienced
multidisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in Sleep and Circadian Medicine, Biomedical Imaging,
Psychiatry, Addiction Medicine, Nursing, and Psychology will conduct this research. This proposal will fulfill a
critical step towards identifying novel sleep and circadian-focused treatment approaches that may lead to
improved outcomes for patients with OUD.",<Adanon><Affect><Alcohol Chemical Class><Alcohols><Althose><American><Application Context><Assay><Behavior Conditioning Therapy><Behavior Modification><Behavior Therapy><Behavior Treatment><Behavioral Conditioning Therapy><Behavioral Modification><Behavioral Therapy><Behavioral Treatment><Bioassay><Biological><Biological Assay><Blood><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Brain><Brain Diseases><Brain Disorders><Brain Nervous System><Buprenorphine><Characteristics><Chronic><Circadian Rhythms><Clinical><Collaborations><Conditioning Therapy><Conflict><Conflict (Psychology)><Cyclicity><Discipline of Nursing><Dolophine><Drugs><Encephalon><Encephalon Diseases><Environmental Factor><Environmental Risk Factor><Esthetics><Evidence based treatment><FDA approved><Family><Family Characteristics><Fingerprint><Functional MRI><Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Gonadal Steroid Hormones><Home><Human><Impairment><Insomnia><Insomnia Disorder><Interview><Intracranial CNS Disorders><Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders><Investigators><Life Stress><Light><Link><Measures><Mediating><Medication><Medicine><Melatonin><Methadone><Methadose><Modern Man><Moods><Nalorex><Naltrexone><Nature><Neighborhoods><Nemexin><Network Analysis><Neurocognitive><Nicotine><Noise><Nursing><Nursing Field><Nursing Profession><Nyctohemeral Rhythm><Pain><Painful><Pathway Analysis><Pathway interactions><Patient outcome><Patient-Centered Outcomes><Patient-Focused Outcomes><Patients><Pattern><Periodicity><Persons><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Photoradiation><Polysomnography><Prevention><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Psychiatry><Psychology><ReVia><Relapse><Reporting><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Rhythmicity><Risk><Risk Factors><Safety><Series><Sex Hormones><Sex Steroid Hormones><Sleep><Sleep Apnea><Sleep Apnea Syndromes><Sleep Deprivation><Sleep Hypopnea><Sleep Monitoring><Sleep-Disordered Breathing><Sleeplessness><Social support><Somnography><Stimulant><Stress><Structure><Survey Instrument><Surveys><System><Testing><Treatment outcome><Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm><Violence><Vivitrol><Wrist><actigraph><actigraphy><addiction><addictive disorder><adverse childhood events><adverse childhood experiences><behavior intervention><behavioral intervention><biologic><biomedical imaging><circadian><circadian process><cognitive function><connectome><contextual factors><daily biorhythm><deficient sleep><drug/agent><environmental risk><executive control><executive function><experience><fMRI><gonadal steroids><homes><illicit opiate><illicit opioid><improved><improved outcome><inadequate sleep><incentive salience><innovate><innovation><innovative><insufficient sleep><multidisciplinary><negative affect><negative affectivity><neural><novel><observational cohort study><opiate consumption><opiate drug use><opiate intake><opiate use><opiate use disorder><opioid consumption><opioid drug use><opioid intake><opioid treatment program><opioid use><opioid use disorder><overdose death><overdose fatalities><pain perception><pathway><patient oriented outcomes><pharmacologic><polysomnographic><poor sleep><primary outcome><psychologic trauma><psychological shock><psychological trauma><psychosocial><quality of sleep><racism><response><response to therapy><response to treatment><reward processing><sex steroid><sleep debt><sleep deficiency><sleep deficit><sleep insufficiency><sleep loss><sleep measurement><sleep polysomnography><sleep quality><sleep-related breathing disorder><social cohesion><social support network><substance use><substance using><therapeutic response><therapy response><treatment response><treatment responsiveness><violent><violent behavior>,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Mental Health; Neurosciences; Opioid Misuse and Addiction; Opioids; Prevention; Sleep Research; Social Determinants of Health; Substance Misuse
CRCNS: Mechanisms and consequences of infraslow oscillations in sleep,CRCNS: Mechanisms and consequences of infraslow oscillations in sleep,"During sleep, the mammalian brain alternates between two major brain states, rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM
(NREM) sleep. Recent work showed that the electroencephalogram (EEG) during NREM sleep in both
humans and mice exhibits a pronounced infraslow (~50s) modulation in the sigma (10-15 Hz) power range Transitions
from NREM to REM sleep and spontaneous awakenings are synchronized with this infraslow o power (ISP) rhythm,
suggesting that it plays a crucial role in shaping sleep architecture and influencing sleep quality. Yet, the
mechanisms underlying the generation of infraslow rhythms remain largely unknown. Importantly, the ISP rhythm
also strongly modulates the activity of neurons in REM sleep-regulatory brain areas including the locus coeruleus
(LC), dorsomedial medulla (dmM), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and dorsal raphe (DR). However, current models of
sleep regulation lack this prominent infraslow rhythm, and a functional understanding of its impacts on sleep
architecture therefore remains elusive. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the dmM controls the ISP
rhythm through its interactions with the LC and that infraslow fluctuations in the activity of DR/PAG neurons control
the stability of NREM sleep and consequently gate transitions to REM sleep. The specific aims combine
experimental studies and biophysical computational modeling to determine mechanisms governing the ISP rhythm,
and to understand the consequences of this rhythm on sleep architecture, particularly NREM--+REM transitions. In
AIM 1, we will perform Neuropixels recordings along with optogenetic manipulation to identify how network
interactions between dmM and LC neurons regulate the ISP rhythm In parallel, we will develop computational
models informed by recorded data to identify underlying mechanisms of infraslow rhythm generation in the dmM-LC
circuit In AIM 2 we will conduct Neuropixels recordings to identify the functional connectivity among different
subclasses of DR/PAG neurons. By optogenetically blocking external infraslow inputs to the DR/PAG and
conducting behavioral REM sleep deprivation, we will probe how the infraslow rhythmicity and REM sleep pressure
affect the dynamics in the DR/PAG network and state transitions. In parallel, we will construct computational models
informed by the recorded data to identify the dynamic interactions among different DR/PAG neuron subclasses and
to analyze the effects of infraslow activity and REM sleep pressure on simulated sleep architecture. Our studies will
bridge a fundamental gap in our understanding of how the mammalian brain generates infraslow
rhythms. Furthermore, results will identify targets for enhancing the ISP rhythm to test its impact on sleep quality,
and will lay the groundwork to develop complementary and integrative health approaches to leverage infraslow brain
dynamics to promote healthy sleep and thus physiological and emotional well-being.",<Affect><Affective Disorders><Area><Autoregulation><Behavioral><Biophysics><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Brain Stem><Brainstem><CNS lymphatic system><Cardiac Chronotropism><Chronic Disease><Chronic Illness><Complementary Health><Computer Models><Computerized Models><Control Locus><Coupled><Coupling><Cyclicity><Data><Development><Disease><Disorder><Dorsal><EEG><Early Diagnosis><Electroencephalogram><Electroencephalography><Emotional well being><Encephalon><Exhibits><Fast-Wave Sleep><Feedback><Feels well><Frequencies><Generations><Health><Heart Rate><Homeostasis><Human><Impairment><Instruction><Integrative Medicine><Levarterenol><Levonorepinephrine><Link><Locus Coeruleus><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Mesencephalic Central Gray><Mice><Mice Mammals><Midbrain Central Gray><Modeling><Modern Man><Mood Disorders><Murine><Mus><NREM><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Network-based><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neurons><Noradrenaline><Norepinephrine><Normal mental condition><Normal mental state><Normal psyche><Nucleus Pigmentosus Pontis><Pain><Pain Disorder><Painful><Paradoxical Sleep><Periaqueductal Gray><Periodicity><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiological Homeostasis><Play><Process><Property><Psychologic Stress><Psychological Health><Psychological Stress><Psychological Well Being><REM Sleep><REM Sleep Deprivations><Rhombencephalic Sleep><Rhythmicity><Role><Sense of well-being><Shapes><Sleep><Sleep Architecture><Sleep disturbances><Source><Stress><Testing><Variant><Variation><Well in self><Work><aberrant sleep><annulus of the aqueduct><biophysical foundation><biophysical principles><biophysical sciences><blue nucleus><brain lymph system><brain lymphatic system><cerebrospinal fluid flow><chronic disorder><chronic pain condition><chronic pain disorder><chronic painful condition><computational modeling><computational models><computer based models><computer based prediction><computerized modeling><developmental><disrupted sleep><disturbed sleep><dreaming sleep><early detection><emotional wellbeing><emotional wellness><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><glia lymphatic circuit><glia-lymphatic system><glial lymphatic system><glialymphatic circuit><glialymphatic network><glialymphatic pathway><glialymphatic system><glymphatic clearance pathway><glymphatic pathway><glymphatic system><glymphatic-lymphatic system><glymphatics><impaired sleep><improvement on sleep><integrative healing><integrative health><irregular sleep><locus ceruleus structure><mental well-being><mental wellbeing><mental wellness><midbrain central gray substance><neural><neural mechanism><neurofeedback><neuromechanism><neuronal><non rapid eye movement><non-REM><non-rapid eye movement><nonREM><nonrapid eye movement><optogenetics><paravascular system><periaqueductal gray matter><potential biological marker><potential biomarker><predictive modeling><pressure><psychological wellbeing><psychological wellness><quality of sleep><rapid eye movement><rapid eye movement sleep><rapid eye movement sleep deprivations><response><self wellness><sense of wellbeing><sleep control><sleep disruption><sleep dysregulation><sleep improvement><sleep quality><sleep regulation><social role><stress disorder><synergism><vasomotion><wasting>,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Complementary and Integrative Health; Mental Health; Neurosciences; Pain Research; Sleep Research
The Neuroimmunology of Depression in Women Living With HIV,The Neuroimmunology of Depression in Women Living With HIV,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
In response to RFA-DA-21-116, “Mood Disorders in People Living with HIV: Mechanisms and Pathways”,
we
propose to investigate neuroimmunological and reward functions to study comorbid depression in women living
with HIV (WLWH), a group heavily impacted by depression and its health consequences, yet underrepresented
in HIV research. The proposed research will build upon the established Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study
(MACS)/Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) (Dr. Sharma, MPI of Bronx
MWCCS) and its unique cohort of phenotypically well-characterized women with and without HIV. Our proposed
model is: (1) HIV infection induces systemic inflammation (cytokines, kynurenines); (2) systemic inflammation
extends to the CNS inducing oxidative stress [↓glutathione (GSH, antioxidant)] and gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA, major inhibitory neurotransmitter) deficits; (3) such neurochemical changes alter the reward circuitry,
which contribute to the high prevalence of depression in WLWH. In support of this model, our immunological
work in the WIHS found increased kynurenine pathway (KP) activity in WLWH compared to women without HIV,
and among WLWH, KP activity was higher in WLWH with depression. In our depression non-HIV research, we
found that anhedonia–a core symptom of depression reflecting reward deficits–was associated with worse
depression outcomes, including chronicity and suicidality. To better delineate reward circuitry, we identified
distinct resting-state network features associated with depression and anhedonia using striatal-based intrinsic
functional connectivity and whole-brain parcellation data-driven graph theory analysis. We additionally utilized
the reward flanker (RFT) and reward prediction error (RPET) fMRI tasks to examine distinct brain activity during
reward anticipation, attainment, and prediction errors, which predicted future depression severity. Utilizing proton
MR spectroscopy, we showed that anhedonia accounted for decreased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) GABA
levels in adolescent depression, and moreover, we documented inverse relationships between cortical GSH and
anhedonia severity in depressed adults. Furthermore, we reported associations between circulatory cytokines
and kynurenines with both anhedonia and reward neurocircuitry in youth. Extending our compelling findings, we
will now test the overall hypothesis that WLWH exhibit increased systemic and CNS inflammation, which leads
to reward dysfunction and subsequently depression. We will utilize a 2×2 factorial design: 1) 100 depressed
WLWH; 2) 100 non-depressed WLWH; 3) 50 depressed HIV negative women; and 4) 50 non-depressed HIV-
negative women. Participants will have comprehensive evaluations at baseline, 6- and 12-months assessing
depression, reward, anxiety, trauma, HIV treatment, CD4+ count, and VL. F-MRI (resting-state, RFT, RPET), 1H
MRS (GABA, GSH), a reward computerized task and cognitive tests will be done at baseline.","<21+ years old><4-Aminobutanoic Acid><4-Aminobutyric Acid><4-amino-butanoic acid><AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Affective Disorders><Aminalon><Aminalone><Anhedonia><Anterior><Antioxidants><Anxiety><Blood monocyte><Brain><Brain Nervous System><CD4 Lymphocyte Count><CD4+ Cell Counts><CD4+ Counts><Chronic><Cohort Studies><Concurrent Studies><Corpus Striatum><Corpus striatum structure><Data><Depressed mood><Diagnosis><Discipline><Emotional Depression><Encephalon><Epidemic><Evaluation><Exhibits><Functional MRI><Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Future><GABA><Glutathione><H+ element><HIV><HIV Infections><HIV Seronegativities><HIV Seronegativity><HIV negative><HTLV-III Infections><HTLV-III Seronegativities><HTLV-III Seronegativity><HTLV-III-LAV Infections><Health><Heterogeneity><High Prevalence><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections><Hydrogen Ions><Immune><Immunes><Immunochemical Immunologic><Immunologic><Immunologic Stimulation><Immunological><Immunological Stimulation><Immunologically><Immunologics><Immunostimulation><Impoverished><Inflammation><Infrastructure><Kynurenine><LAV-HTLV-III><Learning><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><MR Imaging><MR Spectroscopy><MR Tomography><MRI><MRIs><Machine Learning><Macrophage><Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy><Marrow monocyte><Measures><Mediating><Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance><Menopausal Status><Mental Depression><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Modeling><Mood Disorders><Mφ><NMR Imaging><NMR Tomography><Nerve Transmitter Substances><Neuroimmune><Neurotransmitters><Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Nucleus Accumbens><Outcome><Oxidative Stress Induction><Participant><Pathway interactions><Peripheral><Persons><Phenotype><Poverty><Process><Protons><Psychological Health><Reporting><Research><Rest><Rewards><Role><Sample Size><Self Assessment><Severities><Sleep><Striate Body><Striatum><T4 Lymphocyte Count><Testing><The Multi-center AIDS Cohort Study><The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study><Thick><Thickness><Trauma><Ventral Tegmental Area><Virus-HIV><Vulnerable Populations><Woman><Women's Interagency HIV Study><Work><Youth><Youth 10-21><Zeugmatography><adolescent depression><adolescents with depression><adulthood><behavior construct><behavioral construct><causal diagram><causal model><cell type><child depression><childhood depression><childhood onset depression><cingulate cortex><clinical relevance><clinically relevant><co-morbid depression><co-morbid with depression><co-morbidity with depression><cognitive assessment><cognitive function><cognitive testing><cohort><comorbid depression><comorbid with depression><comorbidity with depression><computerized><cytokine><deficits in reward learning><depressed><depressed adolescents><depression><depression co-morbidity><depression comorbidity><depression in adolescence><depression symptom><depressive><depressive symptoms><design><designing><disparity in health><fMRI><female outcomes><gamma-Aminobutyric Acid><gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly><gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine><graph theory><health disparity><immunoneurology><improved><indexing><inflammation marker><inflammatory marker><machine based learning><metabolism measurement><metabolomics><metabonomics><monocyte><multi-modality><multidisciplinary><multimodality><neural circuit><neural circuitry><neural imaging><neural mechanism><neuro-imaging><neurochemical><neurochemistry><neurocircuitry><neuroimaging><neuroimmunology><neurological imaging><neuromechanism><nicotine consumption><nicotine use><outcomes among females><outcomes among women><outcomes in females><outcomes in women><pathway><pediatric depression><response><reward anticipation><reward circuit dysfunction><reward circuitry><reward dysfunction><reward system dysfunction><sadness><social role><striatal><subthreshold depression><suicidal><suicidality><symptom cluster><synaptic circuit><synaptic circuitry><systemic inflammation><systemic inflammatory response><ventral tegmentum><vulnerable group><vulnerable individual><vulnerable people><women's outcomes><youth depression><γ-Aminobutyric Acid>",Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Biomedical Imaging; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Depression; HIV/AIDS; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Infectious Diseases; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Women's Health Research
Identification of molecular rhythm changes in postmortem tissue from individuals with psychiatric illness,Identification of molecular rhythm changes in postmortem tissue from individuals with psychiatric illness,"ABSTRACT
Circadian rhythm and sleep disruptions are prevalent in nearly all psychiatry disorders including major
depression (MDD), bipolar disorder (BP), and schizophrenia (SZ). Each cell in the brain has its own molecular
clock which regulates the rhythmic expression of many different genes, allowing cells to maximize efficiency at
times of day in which they are most needed. Importantly, while the core clock does not change from cell to cell,
the genes that the clock regulates can be very different in each cell type and the timing in which genes peak can
also be highly variable, even with some cells having a completely opposite phases of gene expression. Previous
studies by our group and others have established that gene expression rhythms can be reliably measured in
human postmortem brain and that molecular rhythms are highly irregular or disrupted in subjects with psychiatric
disease. In the first funding cycle, we assessed molecular rhythms in tissue homogenates taken from specific
cortical and striatal regions in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BP),
schizophrenia (SZ), or unaffected comparison subjects. Using mouse models, we also established that molecular
rhythms in these regions are important in the regulation of behavior. We also found that particular rhythmic
signatures are associated with features like psychosis independent of clinical diagnosis. In this next funding
cycle, we will dive deeper to determine the rhythmic signatures of individual cell types and how these work in
harmony with others around them to synchronize the brain. We will also determine how these rhythms differ in
subjects with MDD, BP, and SZ. We will perform additional analysis to determine if clinical features across
diagnosis are related to specific rhythmic patterns and assess ultradian and seasonal rhythms. We will focus on
one particular circuit, the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) to nucleus accumbens (NAc), since this
circuit is known to be important in the regulation of reward-related decision making, mood, impulsivity, and
motivation and compare these regions to the motor cortex. To determine the functional relevance of these
molecular rhythm changes in specific cell types we will use mouse models with cell-type specific manipulations

Emergence of arm reaching behavior and lateralization of motor control in infancy,Emergence of arm reaching behavior and lateralization of motor control in infancy,"It is crucial to understand how infants learn to progress from spontaneous movements into goal-directed, refined
motor skills. Infant learning is the focus of early intervention programs, and the need for effective early
intervention is great. Until we understand the mechanisms of development and what promotes or inhibits
successful infant learning, we cannot design optimal early intervention. Our specific objective is to longitudinally
study infant experience (infant and environmental factors) and underlying neural substrates
(electroencephalography (EEG)) as infants learn arm reaching, an early, foundational motor skill.
Current theories suggest that infants learn through a repeated perception-action process and that experiencing
error is the key mechanism for successful infant learning. Thus, Aim 1 will measure error rate longitudinally
across the emergence and refinement of reaching. In Aim 1 we will determine the relationship between error rate
and the development of reaching skill. We hypothesize that infants will demonstrate a high error rate
(errors/attempts) near reaching onset that decreases as they refine the skill, supporting the idea that making
errors is a key experience in order for learning to occur. Aim 2 will focus on individual infant and environmental
factors that predict age of onset of reaching. In Aim 2 we will identify infant and environmental factors related to
the age of reaching onset. Infant factors are motor experience (amount and type (unilateral or bilateral) of daily
arm movement experience) and cognitive development status. Environmental factors are level of maternal
education, quality of caregiver-infant interactions, nutrition, and sleep. We hypothesize that these factors are
related to the age at which infants are observed to begin to reach, and we will determine the strength of the
associations and characteristics of infants reaching at different ages. The results will identify targets for
intervention that are most likely to be successful. Aim 3 will use EEG to determine how brain function changes
as reaching is refined from an unstable skill to a successful, lateralized (typically right arm preference) movement.
Using EEG will allow us to collect data in the home, both resting state and during arm movements. In Aim 3 we
will identify patterns of concurrent brain activity that differentiate between spontaneous arm movements, early
reaching attempts, and skilled reaches in infants with typical development. Based on our pilot data, we
hypothesize that frontal-parietal connectivity increases, interhemispheric connectivity decreases, and sources of
EEG activity shift from bilateral to unilateral as reaches become more goal directed, successful, and lateralized.
Aims 1–3 focus on infants with typical development; exploratory Aim 4 contrasts our findings with a population
likely to show impairment in learning to reach: infants at high risk for cerebral palsy. In exploratory Aim 4 we will
describe patterns of concurrent brain activity during spontaneous arm movements, early reaching attempts, and
skilled reaches in infants at high risk for cerebral palsy. Our results will determine the most relevant factors
related to an infant’s ability to refine his brain function and neuromotor control as he learns to reach.",<Age><Age of Onset><Behavior><Bilateral><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Care Givers><Caregivers><Cerebral Palsy><Characteristics><Child Development Disorders><Data><Development><Developmental Disabilities><EEG><Early Intervention><Education><Educational aspects><Electroencephalogram><Electroencephalography><Encephalon><Environmental Factor><Environmental Risk Factor><Goals><Home><Impairment><Individual><Infant><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Learning><Longitudinal Studies><Measures><Motor><Motor Skills><Movement><Parietal><Pattern><Perception><Population><Predictive Factor><Process><Rest><Risk><Sleep><Source><ages><arm><arm movement><body movement><cognitive development><design><designing><developmental><environmental risk><experience><high risk><homes><infancy><infantile><intervention program><interventional strategy><long-term study><longitudinal outcome studies><longterm study><motor control><neural><nutrition><preference><skill acquisition><skill development><skills><theories>,Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Prevention
A human organoid approach to understanding the role of the locus coeruleus in Alzheimer's disease,A human organoid approach to understanding the role of the locus coeruleus in Alzheimer's disease,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and affects over 6 million Americans. There is
no cure for AD, and many potential treatments have failed, creating a critical need for the development of
additional disease models for novel therapeutic discovery and testing. The hallmark pathology of AD includes
amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau)-containing neurofibrillary tangles. This pathology is
associated with memory loss, which is diagnostic for AD, but is now known to be preceded by earlier prodromal
symptoms including mood and sleep disorders. Dysregulation of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) is
associated with AD symptoms, as its release in the forebrain regulates attention, arousal, stress response, and
learning and memory. Importantly, the locus coeruleus (LC), the main noradrenergic nucleus in the brain and
source of NE in the forebrain, is the first brain region to develop ptau inclusions, may transmit pathogenic tau to
the forebrain, and undergoes catastrophic degeneration in later stages of the disease. Recent evidence indicates
that that early ptau-mediated LC dysfunction contributes to the prodromal symptoms of AD, while LC neuronal
loss later in the disease exacerbates cognitive impairment. However, nearly all information about the LC in AD
has been derived from rodent models and postmortem or human imaging studies. It is not known how the early
ptau accumulation in the human LC affects neuronal function or NE transmission. Organoids, which are 3D
human cell culture models derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, emulate the architecture and
function of human tissue. The goal of this proposal is to develop the first human LC organoid model to address
questions related to the earliest stages of AD. In Aim 1, I will validate our LC organoids by comparing their
structure and function to human and rodent LC neurons. I will then combine LC organoids with cortical organoids
to define assembloid connectivity by tracking NE innervation of the cortical organoids. In Aim 2, I will derive LC
organoids from AD patients and compare their structure, function, and AD pathology to that of LC organoids
derived from healthy subjects. Following LC-cortical assembloid creation, I will assess the consequences of NE
AD pathology transmission from AD LC organoids to control cortical organoids. Together, the proposed
experiments will provide new insights on AD pathology and normal and AD LC-cortex connectivity in living human
neurons. This information would greatly impact AD research and provides a novel model for the development of
new treatment strategies for patients in the earliest stages of AD.",<3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><AD dementia><AD diagnostic><AD model><AD pathology><Address><Affect><Affective Disorders><Alzheimer Type

A controlled evaluation of abstinence-induced withdrawal and motivation to vape/smoke among daily ENDS users vs. cigarette smokers,A controlled evaluation of abstinence-induced withdrawal and motivation to vape/smoke among daily ENDS users vs. cigarette smokers,"Project Summary
Despite the importance of smoking withdrawal symptoms (e.g., craving, negative affect, disrupted cognition)
for understanding tobacco/nicotine dependence and elucidating intervention targets, the parent study is the
first-ever prospective, controlled comparison of abstinence-induced withdrawal between people who use
electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and those who smoke cigarettes. However, like most research in
the field, we currently exclude people with schizophrenia (SCZ). Lack of representation of people with SCZ is a
major problem in nicotine/tobacco research, contributing to greater tobacco-related health disparities than
perhaps any other population segment, with extremely high rates of use and low rates of cessation, which
contributes to a marked excess in morbidity and mortality. A burgeoning literature is examining ENDS as a
harm reduction approach to tobacco smoking. However, there are major concerns with this direction of
research, particularly for people with SCZ. Though ENDS appear much less harmful than cigarettes, they still
carry neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular consequences, and research on interventions for vaping cessation is
in its infancy. Indeed, the addiction liability of ENDS in people with SCZ is unknown. It is critical that we
understand how withdrawal from ENDS compares to that of cigarettes. Notably, results from the general
population (like the parent study) may not generalize to SCZ as they may be more vulnerable to ENDS
dependency and experience different or more severe withdrawal due to multiple disease-related factors. The
proposed supplement leverages the strengths of the parent study, which focuses on the general population, and
enhances its overall project impact and relevance to health disparities by recruiting a sample of people with
SCZ, half of whom vape ENDS daily and half of whom smoke daily. The supplement will provide novel data on
the effects of 24-hr abstinence from vaping vs smoking on self- report and objective assessments of major
facets of withdrawal in people with SCZ, as well as changes in neuropsychiatric symptoms. It will also provide a
novel comparison of vaping/smoking withdrawal in people with SCZ (the supplemental data) to a matched
group of people without SCZ (from the parent trial) and explore candidate moderators (e.g., antipsychotic
class, sex). Results will provide the first literature on ENDS withdrawal in people with SCZ, who continue to be
an under-represented group in nicotine/tobacco research, despite their facing marked tobacco-related health
disparities (a NIDA strategic plan cross-cutting theme). Results will directly inform the suitability of ENDS for
tobacco harm reduction (NIDA strategic plan priority area #2) in people with SCZ. Moreover, the
comprehensive, multi-modal assessment of withdrawal facets will directly inform the development of ENDS
cessation interventions for people with SCZ.",<Abstinence><Address><Administrative Supplement><Agitation><Anhedonia><Antipsychotic Agents><Antipsychotic Drugs><Antipsychotics><Appetite stimulated><Area><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Cigarette><Cigarette Smoker><Clinical Trials><Clinical assessments><Cognition><Cognitive><Data><Dependence><Development><Diagnosis><Differences between sexes><Differs between sexes><Disease><Disorder><Disparities><Disparity><Electronic Nicotine Delivery Product><Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems><Electronic cigarette><Evaluation><Exclusion><Face><Funding><General Population><General Public><Goals><Harm Minimization><Harm Reduction><Heart Vascular><Increased food appetite><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Knowledge><Laboratories><Literature><Major Tranquilizers><Major Tranquilizing Agents><Matched Group><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Motivation><NIDA><National Institute of Drug Abuse><National Institute on Drug Abuse><Neuroleptic Agents><Neuroleptic Drugs><Neuroleptics><Nicotine><Nicotine Dependence><Nicotine Withdrawal><Parents><Participant><Patient Recruitments><Patient Self-Report><Persons><Pharmacological Study><Pharmacology Study><Population><Psychomotor Agitation><Psychomotor Excitement><Psychomotor Hyperactivity><Psychomotor Restlessness><Quasi-experiment><Quasi-experimental analysis><Quasi-experimental approach><Quasi-experimental design><Quasi-experimental methods><Quasi-experimental research><Quasi-experimental study><Quasi-experimental technique><Randomized><Research><Restlessness><Sampling><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Self-Report><Severities><Sex Differences><Sexual differences><Sleep Disorders><Smoke><Smoking><Strategic Planning><System><Testing><Tobacco><Tobacco Dependence><Tobacco smoking><Tobacco smoking behavior><Underrepresented Groups><Underrepresented Populations><Withdrawal><Withdrawal Symptom><Work><addiction liability><addiction potential><behavioral pharmacology><cease smoking><cholinergic><cigarette smoke><circulatory system><clinical training><combustible cigarette><conventional cigarette><craving><dementia praecox><develop therapy><developmental><disparity in health><e-cig><e-cigarette><e-vape><ecig><ecigarette><effective intervention><electronic nicotine delivery device><electronic nicotine distribution system><electronic vape><experience><faces><facial><health disparity><increased appetite><increased hunger><infancy><infantile><intervention development><interventional strategy><mortality><multi-modality><multimodality><multiple substance use><multisubstance use><negative affect><negative affectivity><neuropsychiatric><neuropsychiatric symptom><neuropsychiatry><nicotine addiction><nicotine dependent><novel><parent><participant recruitment><pharmacobehavioral><poly substance use><polysubstance use><prospective><quit smoking><randomisation><randomization><randomly assigned><recruit><schizophrenic><sex><sex based differences><sex-dependent differences><sex-related differences><sex-specific differences><sleep diseases><sleep dysfunction><sleep illness><sleep problem><smoking abstinence><smoking cessation><stop smoking><therapy development><tobacco addiction><tobacco dependent><tool><traditional cigarette><treatment development><under representation of groups><under represented groups><under represented people><under represented populations><underrepresentation of groups><underrepresented people><vaping>,Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Prevention; Schizophrenia; Serious Mental Illness; Substance Misuse; Tobacco; Tobacco Smoke and Health
Developmental Impacts of Sleep on Positive Valence Systems and Socioemotional Functioning during Pre-Adolescence,Developmental Impacts of Sleep on Positive Valence Systems and Socioemotional Functioning during Pre-Adolescence,"Project Summary
Sleep patterns characterized by truncated weekday sleep followed by weekend recovery sleep (‘social jetlag’)
often begin to emerge during pre-adolescence (8-12 years). Research from our team has demonstrated that
this sleep pattern adversely impacts positive valence systems (PVS) in ways that elevate risk for depression
and other psychiatric disorders. Heightened neuroplasticity and re-organization of reward-related brain regions
present during this period of the lifespan likely confer a unique opportunity for prevention and intervention, but
research on sleep-affective relations during this vulnerable period of development remains limited. The present
set of studies will examine mechanistic pathways between behavioral and neurophysiological (EEG) sleep
patterns and PVS in social and non-social contexts during pre-adolescence. Study 1 includes an intensive one-
year longitudinal burst design with a non-clinical sample of youth (N = 290; ages 8-12). At three separate
assessment waves (6 months apart), participants will complete a 14-day monitoring period including objective
sleep using actigraphy, daily video diaries and surveys, passive audio recordings of naturalistic social
interactions, and a series of behavioral tasks to assess reward responsiveness, learning, and valuation. This
longitudinal study is complemented by Study 2, which includes a separate sample of non-clinical youth (N =
64; ages 10-12) who will complete an experimental protocol using a randomized crossover design. Participants
will stay in the laboratory with a friend for two 5-night visits where dyads will simultaneously undergo multiple
nights of sleep restriction followed by recovery sleep, as well as 5 nights of healthy sleep. Each evening in the
lab, participants will complete surveys and paradigms assessing social and non-social reward responsiveness,
learning, and valuation. A daily recorded interaction period with their peer will also be coded for positive social
behaviors (approach behaviors, affective synchrony, positive affective expression, and gaze patterns using eye
tracking). Participants will also complete polysomnography during each night of the laboratory protocols and
changes in sleep EEG (i.e., rapid eye movement sleep) will be examined as a mechanism underlying daytime
socioemotional changes. Additional analyses for both studies focus on how biological sex modifies
socioemotional vulnerability to sleep patterns. The proposed research addresses multiple critical gaps in
scientific knowledge surrounding the impact of sleep on the development of reward systems and social
functioning during pre-adolescence. Specific aims leverage RDoC, including PVS and Arousal/Regulatory
systems, and support NIMH’s strategic plan to chart mental illness trajectories and determine when, where,
and how to intervene. Results will inform theories of these neurodevelopmental processes to better inform
prevention and treatment efforts.",<12-20 years old><8 year old><8 years of age><Acute><Address><Adolescence><Affect><Affective><Affective Disorders><Age><Arousal and Regulatory Systems><Arousal/Regulatory Systems><Behavior><Behavioral><Binding><Brain region><CNS plasticity><Characteristics><Childhood><Code><Coding System><Communities><Cross-Over Designs><Crossover Design><Data><Development><Early identification><Emotional><Eye Movements><Fast-Wave Sleep><Female><Friends><Goals><Health><Height><Impairment><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Jet Lag><Jet Lag Syndrome><Jetlag><Jetlag Syndrome><Knowledge><Laboratories><Learning><Long-Term Effects><Longitudinal Studies><Longterm Effects><Maintenance><Measurement><Measures><Mediating><Mental Depression><Mental disorders><Mental health disorders><Methods><Modeling><Modification><Molecular Interaction><Monitor><Mood Disorders><Motivation><NIMH><National Institute of Mental Health><Neuronal Plasticity><Paradoxical Sleep><Participant><Pathway interactions><Pattern><Physiology><Polysomnography><Positive Valence><Prevalence><Prevention><Process><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Psychiatric Disease><Psychiatric Disorder><RDoC><REM Sleep><Randomized><Recovery><Reporting><Research><Research Domain Criteria><Rewards><Rhombencephalic Sleep><Risk><Role><Sampling><Series><Sleep><Sleep Deprivation><Sleep Disorders><Sleep Monitoring><Sleep disturbances><Social Behavior><Social Functioning><Social Interaction><Somnography><Strategic Planning><Survey Instrument><Surveys><System><Time><Time Zone Change Syndrome><Time Zone Syndrome><Visit><Youth><Youth 10-21><aberrant sleep><actigraph><actigraphy><adolescence (12-20)><age 8 years><ages><approach behavior><biological sex><central nervous system plasticity><deficient sleep><depression><design><designing><developmental><diaries><disrupted sleep><disturbed sleep><dreaming sleep><eight year old><eight years of age><emotional experience><emotional functioning><eye tracking><function socially><functioning social><gaze><impaired sleep><inadequate sleep><insight><insufficient sleep><interventional strategy><irregular sleep><life span><lifespan><long-term study><longitudinal outcome studies><longterm study><male><mental illness><neural plasticity><neurophysiological><neurophysiology><neuroplastic><neuroplasticity><pathway><pediatric><peer><polysomnographic><poor sleep><pre-adolescent><preadolescence><preteen><psychiatric illness><psychological disorder><randomisation><randomization><randomly assigned><rapid eye movement><rapid eye movement sleep><response><reward anticipation><sleep behavior><sleep debt><sleep deficiency><sleep deficit><sleep diseases><sleep disruption><sleep dysfunction><sleep dysregulation><sleep habit><sleep health><sleep hygiene><sleep illness><sleep insufficiency><sleep loss><sleep measurement><sleep pattern><sleep polysomnography><sleep problem><social><social communication><social role><sociobehavior><sociobehavioral><theories><visual tracking>,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Mental Health; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Prevention; Sleep Research
Neurophysiology of Melanopsin Photoreceptors,Neurophysiology of Melanopsin Photoreceptors,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are neurons of the mammalian eye that capture light
with a molecule called melanopsin, triggering a phototransduction cascade to generate an electrical response.
This response influences dozens of brain regions and is essential for light’s normal regulation of processes that
include the circadian clock, sleep, mood, and pupil constriction. Our preliminary experiments reveal ipRGC
response features that are suited to these processes and qualitatively distinct from those of the classic rod and
cone photoreceptors. We propose to characterize these response features, learn how they arise from
molecular mechanisms within ipRGCs, and define how they shape signals sent from ipRGCs to the brain. We
will apply patch-clamp electrophysiological recording to the ex vivo mouse retina and its isolated cells,
introducing methods that increase the physiological relevance of our findings. Our experiments will strengthen
the basic understanding of ipRGCs, sensory transduction, and ion channels. They will also provide insight into
the broad question of how cells of particular types are tailored to specific tasks.",<Address><Afferent Neurons><Agitation><Automobile Driving><Behavior><Behavioral><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Brain region><Budgets><Calcium><Cancers><Cardiovascular Diseases><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Isolation><Cell Segregation><Cell Separation><Cell Separation Technology><Cell Signaling><Cells><Circadian Dysregulation><Clampings><Closure by clamp><Communication><Cone><Cone Photoreceptors><Constricted Pupil><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Encephalon><Event><Eye><Eyeball><Fire - disasters><Fires><Foundations><Frequencies><Funding><G Protein-Complex Receptor><G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes><G-Protein-Coupled Receptors><GPCR><Generations><Health><Illumination><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Ion Channel><Ion Channel Gating><Ion Channel Gatings><Ionic Channels><Knowledge><Learning><Light><Light Signal Transduction><Lighting><Link><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Mammalia><Mammalian Cell><Mammals><Membrane Channels><Mental Depression><Mental disorders><Mental health disorders><Metabolic Diseases><Metabolic Disorder><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Miosis disorder><Molecular><Moods><Murine><Mus><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Nervous System><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neurologic Body System><Neurologic Organ System><Neurons><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Noise><Output><Perforation><Persistent Miosis><Photons><Photoradiation><Photoreceptor Cell><Photoreceptors><Photosensitive Cell><Phototransduction><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiology><Play><Process><Property><Psychiatric Disease><Psychiatric Disorder><Psychomotor Agitation><Psychomotor Excitement><Psychomotor Hyperactivity><Psychomotor Restlessness><Pupillary Miosis><Regulation><Reporter><Reporting><Research><Restlessness><Retina><Retinal Cone><Retinal Ganglion Cells><Rod><Rods and Cones><Role><Sensory><Sensory Neurons><Shapes><Sight><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Sleep><Small Pupil><Stimulus><Stream><Techniques><Testing><Thesaurismosis><Time><Variant><Variation><Vertebrate Photoreceptors><Vision><Visual Receptor><Visual Transduction><biological signal transduction><biophysical equipment><biophysical tools><cardiovascular disorder><cell sorting><cell transduction><cell type><cellular transduction><circadian abnormality><circadian clock><circadian disruption><circadian disturbance><circadian dysfunction><circadian impairment><circadian pacemaker><cone cell><depression><driving><electrophysiological><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><falls><fire><improved><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><malignancy><melanopsin><mental illness><metabolism disorder><model organism><neoplasm/cancer><neural><neuronal><neurophysiological><neurophysiology><pandemic><pandemic disease><patch clamp><psychiatric illness><psychological disorder><response><retinal ganglion><sleep control><sleep regulation><social role><spatiotemporal><transduced cells><visual function><voltage><voltage clamp>,Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurosciences; Sleep Research
Temporally scalable recording of brain-wide single-cell physiology,Temporally scalable recording of brain-wide single-cell physiology,"Abstract
Many fundamental questions in neuroscience and neurological disorders, such as those associated with
learning, memory, sleep, aging, and disease progression, would benefit greatly from a technology that enables
brain-wide single-cell readout of signaling activities and gene expression changes over extended time periods
(over weeks, months, to even years). Current single-cell physiology recording methods require external
interfacing to live cells, either optically (via fluorescent probes plus microscopy) or electrically (via electrical
probes). It has been a major challenge to perform long-term optical imaging in vivo beyond several hours, due
to fast photobleaching of fluorescent probes. Electrical probes, on the other hand, often induce unwanted long-
term immune response after implantation and do not support measurement of intracellular signaling and gene
expression activities. In addition, these single-cell recording methods do not support large-scale readout
across the whole brain, while modalities that can image whole brains, such as ultrasound, MRI, and CT, lack
single-cell resolutions. We aim to bridge this technological gap by developing a genetically encoded,
temporally scalable ‘protein ticker tape’ recording system, to enable long-term, brain-wide recording of single-
cell physiology in vivo without any external interfacing to live cells. In our prior work, we found it is possible to
record and store cell physiology histories over time, such as gene expression histories, along elongating
protein self-assemblies in live cells (analogous to tree rings permanently storing wood’s growth conditions), for
subsequent single-cell readout in situ via simple post-mortem tissue processing and imaging techniques. In
this project, we will leverage our expertise in protein engineering and neurotechnology development to
transform this protein ticker tape concept into a technological solution that enables brain-wide single-cell
physiology recording over long (up to a year) and scalable periods of time, where the recording duration is
externally defined by users. We will first engineer novel protein assemblies, via an AI-powered protein design
approach, to boost the information storage capacity and recording precision of protein ticker tapes. Next, we
will employ chemical and light dependent expression systems to externally control the elongation speed of the
protein self-assembly, to enable various recording durations (from a day to a year) externally defined by users.
Finally, we will couple protein ticker tapes to promoters and synthetic expression systems that respond to
signaling events, transcription factor activities, circadian rhythms, and gene expression levels, to enable
recording of these cell physiological events separately and in parallel. We will genetically deliver these protein
ticker tapes in single cells across living mouse brains to characterize and validate their performance, fidelity,

Prospective Health Impacts of Chronic Binge Eating Disorder in Hispanic Older Women Living with Food Insecurity (PROSPERA),Prospective Health Impacts of Chronic Binge Eating Disorder in Hispanic Older Women Living with Food Insecurity (PROSPERA),"ABSTRACT
Women live longer than men, yet they also experience greater morbidity, which makes understanding how
specific chronic conditions further impact multimorbidity in women essential. Importantly, chronic conditions
disproportionately affect certain women, including those who are historically underrepresented, understudied,
and underreported (U3) in biomedical research. Binge Eating Disorder (BED) involves discrete episodes
(≥1/week) of eating abnormally large amounts of food in one sitting while feeling out of control. BED is more
common among women than men and is associated with poor cardiometabolic and mental health profiles,
adjusting for BMI. As with many chronic conditions, disparities exist in both the prevalence and understanding
of chronic BED within subpopulations of women. Specifically, because eating disorders are stereotyped as
disorders of youth, white race, and affluence, data in populations beyond this stereotype are highly limited.
Yet, recent evidence indicates greater BED prevalence and negative health correlates among women in two
understudied areas: 1) older age, and 2) economically disadvantaged. Cross-sectional research suggests
nearly 20% of women aged ≥60 years may meet BED severity criteria, and that those with BED experience
poorer mental health and quality of life, and profound cardiometabolic morbidity. Recent research among
largely Hispanic/Latino (H/L) samples living with food insecurity (FI) found that 17-20% of older women (aged
≥51 years) met BED severity criteria. One limitation to this research is its cross-sectional nature. Thus, the
prospective health impacts of BED among older H/L women living with FI remains unknown. Another limitation
is the insufficient exploration of environmental factors (e.g., psychosocial; social determinants of health
[SDoH]) that influence cardiometabolic risk in older H/L women who have chronic BED and live with FI. The
specific research objectives of this R01 are to determine the prospective mental and cardiometabolic health
impacts of chronic BED in older H/L women living with FI, thus creating a risk index for the health burden of
BED and FI in later life for H/L women. The proposed study will include 250 older (≥50 years) H/L women living
with FI (n =125 with chronic BED & n = 125 no lifetime history of any eating disorder) to assess the prospective
impact of BED on cardiometabolic health (e.g., HbA1C, BMI change), sarcopenic obesity, menopause quality
of life, physical functioning, and depression over 2 years, and to explore SDoH factors between groups on
outcomes (Aim 1); examine longitudinal trajectories of BED and FI (Aim 2); and explore the lived experiences
and major life events among participants with and without BED in a concurrent nested mixed-method design
(Aim 3). The long-term objectives of this research program are to a) elucidate potential factors of influence
(e.g., mediators/moderators) on the health burden of chronic BED in older H/L women living with FI, b) develop
U3 relevant, scalable interventions so that healthcare providers and hunger relief organizations can improve
services, and c) generate data for policy change to ultimately reduce multimorbidity in this U3 population.",<65 and older><65 or older><65 years of age and older><65 years of age or more><65 years of age or older><65+ years><65+ years old><> 65 years><Affect><Aged 65 and Over><Area><BMI><BMI percentile><BMI z-score><Binge Eating><Binge eating disorder><Biomedical Research><Body mass index><Caucasian><Caucasian Race><Caucasians><Caucasoid><Caucasoid Race><Characteristics><Chronic><Clinical><Data><Data Collection><Disease><Disorder><Disparities><Disparity><Eating><Eating Disorders><Economically Deprived><Emotional Depression><Enrollment><Environmental Factor><Environmental Risk Factor><Event><Feeling><Food><Food Intake><Frequencies><Future><Glycohemoglobin A><Glycosylated hemoglobin A><Goals><Hb A1><Hb A1a+b><Hb A1c><HbA1><HbA1c><Health><Health Care Providers><Health Personnel><Healthcare Providers><Healthcare worker><Hemoglobin A(1)><Hispanic><History><Hunger><Individual><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Investigators><Latina><Latino><Life><Lipids><Lived experience><Lived experiences><Mediator><Medical><Medical Research><Menopause><Mental Depression><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Methods><Modeling><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Nature><Non-Hispanic><Nonhispanic><Not Hispanic or Latino><Obesity><Occidental><Outcome><Over weight><Overweight><Participant><Physical Function><Policies><Population><Prevalence><Prospective Studies><Psyche structure><Psychological Health><Public Health><QOL><Quality of life><Quetelet index><Recording of previous events><Reporting><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Risk><Sampling><Seminal><Services><Severities><Sleep Disorders><Stereotyping><Woman><Work><Youth><Youth 10-21><above age 65><adiposity><after age 65><age 65 and greater><age 65 and older><age 65 or older><age > 65><age of 65 years onward><aged><aged 65 and greater><aged 65+><aged ≥65><cardiometabolic><cardiometabolic risk><cardiometabolism><community engaged participatory research><community engaged research><community partnered research><community-engaged study><community-partnered study><compulsive eating><compulsive feeding><compulsive overeating><corpulence><depression><depression symptom><depressive><depressive symptoms><design><designing><disadvantaged female><disadvantaged women><economic determinant><economic disparity><economically disadvantaged><enroll><environmental risk><ethnic minority group><ethnic minority individual><ethnic minority people><ethnic minority population><experience><feelings><female morbidity><food insecurity><health care personnel><health care worker><health provider><health related quality of life><health workforce><health-span><healthcare personnel><healthspan><healthy life span><hemoglobin A1c><high risk><histories><human old age (65+)><improved><indexing><interventional strategy><late life><medical personnel><men><mental><mid life><mid-life><middle age><middle aged><midlife><morbidity among females><morbidity among women><morbidity in females><morbidity in women><multidisciplinary><multimorbidity><multiple chronic conditions><novel><old age><older women><over 65 years><primary outcome><programs><prospective><psychosocial><recruit><sarcopenic obesity><secondary outcome><sleep diseases><sleep dysfunction><sleep illness><sleep problem><social health determinants><socio-economic><socio-economically><socioeconomically><socioeconomics><stressor><treatment provider><treatment research><under served community><underserved community><white race><women's morbidity><≥65 years>,Aging; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Eating Disorders; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Nutrition; Obesity; Racial and Ethnic Minority Health Research; Social Determinants of Health; Women's Health Research
Effects of Successful OSA TreatmENT on Memory and AD BIomarkers in Older AduLts (ESSENTIAL),Effects of Successful OSA TreatmENT on Memory and AD BIomarkers in Older AduLts (ESSENTIAL),"The prevalence of Alzheimer disease (AD) is high and projected to increase. Further, epidemiological data
suggests that ~15% of AD risk may be attributed to sleep problems. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is also
common among the elderly (30-55%), and our prior work has established that cognitively normal older women
with OSA have nearly double the 5-year risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia.
Further, we showed that: i. OSA patients treated with positive airway pressure (PAP) experienced significant
overnight increases in plasma neurofilament light (NfL), a marker of neural injury, with strong trends for AD-
specific biomarkers (i.e. Aβ40 and Tau) after PAP withdrawal; ii. OSA predicted longitudinal increases in AD
biomarkers; and, iii. PAP treatment delayed the onset of MCI in subjects with reported OSA. There is therefore
strong evidence suggesting that OSA treatment could be an important prevention strategy for AD. However,
trials for treatment of OSA to slow cognitive decline and progression to AD face a number of challenges. First,
the most effective therapy (PAP) has poor adherence. A second challenge is defining the target population:
prior trials targeted OSA patients with MCI/AD, who have more advanced disease and could be less amenable
to treatment. A third challenge is identifying cognitive testing that is sensitive to sleep disruption, and linked to
increased AD risk. (To capture effects of OSA on the offline processing phase requires sleep-dependent
memory paradigms, in which the encoding and recall of information are separated by a period of sleep
with/without OSA). Finally, a randomized trial of sufficient duration to test the effects of treatment of OSA on
risk of incident AD is not feasible. Our proposed trial, Effects of Successful OSA TreatmENT on Memory and
AD BIomarkers in Older AduLts (ESSENTIAL), addresses these challenges. ESSENTIAL is a 5-year study of
cognitively normal older adults with newly diagnosed OSA, ages 55-75, recruited from 4 well-established sleep
clinics. OSA patients (n=200) will be randomized to either: i) a 3-month OSA treatment by any combination of
PAP, OAT, and positional therapy that results in an “effective” improvement in the apnea-hypopnea index
(AHI); ii) a waitlist control group to receive treatment at the conclusion of the 3-month intervention period.
Effectively treated individuals (~150) and untreated individuals (~100) will then be followed for up to 24 months
to compare whether sustained improvements in AHI are associated with better cognitive function and AD
biomarker change profiles as compared to untreated controls. Participants will undergo PSG, actigraphy,
cognitive tests, and blood draws at baseline, 3 and 24 months. Our aims are: 1) To compare 3-month change
in plasma AD biomarkers (NfL, p-tau, Aβ) between those randomized to OSA treatment and wait-list control
groups; 2) To compare 3-month change in cognition between the OSA treatment and wait-list control groups;
3) To examine if sustained reduction in AHI over 24 months among effectively treated participants versus
untreated controls is associated with better 24-month change profiles for AD biomarkers and cognition.","<AD dementia><Acute><Address><Adherence><Age><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer beta-Protein><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer risk factor><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimer's amyloid><Alzheimer's biomarker><Alzheimer's disease biological marker><Alzheimer's disease risk><Alzheimers Dementia><Alzheimer’s biological marker><Alzheimer’s disease biomarker><Amentia><Amyloid><Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein><Amyloid Beta-Peptide><Amyloid Protein A4><Amyloid Substance><Amyloid beta-Protein><Amyloid β><Amyloid β-Peptide><Amyloid β-Protein><Apnea><Aβ><Biological Markers><Blood><Blood Plasma><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Clinic><Clinical><Clinical Treatment><Cognition><Cognitive><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Control Groups><Data><Delta Wave><Delta Wave sleep><Dementia><Diagnosis><Disease Progression><Disturbance in cognition><Early identification><Effectiveness><Elderly><Elderly woman><Epidemiological data><Epidemiology data><Evaluation><Face><Future><Hypoxemia><Impaired cognition><Individual><Intention><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Light><Link><Liquid substance><MT-bound tau><Measures><Memory><Newly Diagnosed><Obstructive Sleep Apnea><Oral Positive Airway Pressure><Outcome><Participant><Patient Self-Report><Patients><Phase><Photoradiation><Plasma><Plasma Serum><Prevalence><Preventative strategy><Prevention strategy><Preventive strategy><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Randomization trial><Randomized><Randomized, Controlled Trials><Reporting><Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma><Risk><Self-Report><Severities><Sleep><Sleep Disorders><Sleep disturbances><Slow-Wave Sleep><Syndrome, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive><Target Populations><Testing><Waiting Lists><Withdrawal><Work><a beta peptide><aberrant sleep><abeta><actigraph><actigraphy><advanced age><advanced disease><advanced illness><ages><alzheimer risk><amyloid beta><amyloid-b protein><arm><beta amyloid fibril><bio-markers><biologic marker><biomarker><cognitive assessment><cognitive change><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive function><cognitive loss><cognitive testing><dementia risk><disrupted sleep><disturbed sleep><effective therapy><effective treatment><epidemiologic data><experience><faces><facial><flexibility><flexible><fluid><geriatric><hypoxemic><impaired sleep><improved><indexing><innovate><innovation><innovative><interventional strategy><irregular sleep><liquid><malleable risk><microtubule bound tau><microtubule-bound tau><mild cognitive disorder><mild cognitive impairment><modifiable risk><nerve injury><neural injury><neurofilament><novel><older adult><older adulthood><older women><open label><open label study><p-tau><p-τ><phospho-tau><phospho-τ><phosphorylated tau><positive airway pressure><post-translational modification of tau><posttranslational modification of tau><pre-clinical><preclinical><primary degenerative dementia><randomisation><randomization><randomized control trial><randomized trial><randomly assigned><recruit><risk factor for dementia><risk for dementia><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><senior citizen><sleep diseases><sleep disruption><sleep dysfunction><sleep dysregulation><sleep illness><sleep problem><soluble amyloid precursor protein><specific biomarkers><tau><tau Proteins><tau factor><tau phosphorylation><tau posttranslational modification><tau-1><treatment effect><treatment group><trend><trial regimen><trial treatment><waitlist><τ Proteins><τ phosphorylation>",Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Dementia; Lung; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Prevention; Sleep Research; Women's Health Research
Micromanaging Human Sleep Physiology to Treat Sleep Apnea and Other Disorders,Micromanaging Human Sleep Physiology to Treat Sleep Apnea and Other Disorders,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Poor sleep impacts health in many ways, so improved sleep could yield wide-ranging public-health benefits.
Sleep-disordered breathing constitutes a huge public-health problem and current treatments fail for many
patients. Lapses in breathing can fragment sleep, disrupt oxygen levels, and cause other problems.
Contemporary treatments for sleep disorders and recommendations for sleep hygiene are valuable, but more
can be done to engender health-promoting sleep - this project will introduce new strategies for real-time
modulation of sleep physiology that have not been applied or tested in this context.
Basic memory research has shown that memory networks in the brain are active during sleep and that we
can alter this activity. Variants of this method here won't aim to improve memory, as in our past studies, but
rather to impact physiology to yield specific health benefits. Using soft sounds that avoid sleep disruption, with
state-of-the-art monitoring devices applied in the home (nasal respiration, in-ear EEG, and chest EKG), we
aim to change what people do during sleep - their mental and physical sleep habits. The moment one falls
asleep, one's sleep physiology seems automatic and largely beyond control. Yet, our twofold premise is that
(1) memories and habits naturally reactivate during sleep, and (2) we can intervene to strategically modify this
reactivation to achieve specific health-focused goals, transcending basic memory research, as follows.
We start with obstructive sleep apnea patients without structural upper-airway abnormalities. Poor neural
control of breathing during sleep likely contributes to many such cases. Patients will first undergo extensive
daytime training to elicit inhalation when a cue sound is played, such that responses become automatized.
After training, patients continue emitting the conditioned response at night as they fall asleep and, remarkably,
they continue to do so during sleep, thus reducing apnea symptoms. Lab studies testing the methodology will
pave the way for at-home studies; this therapy is designed to be easy-to-use in the home via wearable tech
and sound delivery configured to avoid arousal and target periods when respiration is insufficient (i.e., closedloop
stimulation adjusted based on real-time respiration, movement, and EEG recorded wirelessly).
Expansion to additional applications will be guided by evidence-based methodological insights and will fuel
the development of a new understanding of high-quality sleep. For example, people with or without apnea may
have affect-laden sleep that is maladaptive, as when unconscious rumination pervades sleep. We thus seek to
bias overnight thinking in positive directions to enhance sleep quality; sound cues during sleep will displace
anxious- or depressive-memory retrieval by promoting positive-memory retrieval. Given that suboptimal sleep
is associated with poorer outcomes for mental and physical health, we envision a means to optimize sleep by
correcting maladaptive muscular or affective activity, The high-risk challenge is to develop noninvasive, lowcost,
precision-sleep-control interventions with adaptive protocols to produce better sleep at home.","<Ache><Anxiety><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cardiovascular><Cardiovascular Body System><Cardiovascular Organ System><Cardiovascular system><Disease><Disorder><Drowsiness><Dysfunction><Encephalon><Functional disorder><Health><Heart Vascular><Home><Human><Lethargies><Memory><Mental Depression><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Methods><Modern Man><Muscle><Muscle Tissue><Obstructive Sleep Apnea><Patients><Physiopathology><Psychological Health><Sleep><Sleep Apnea><Sleep Apnea Syndromes><Sleep Deprivation><Sleep Hypopnea><Sleep-Disordered Breathing><Somnolence><Stress><Syndrome, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive><circulatory system><deficient sleep><depression><homes><improved><improvement on sleep><inadequate sleep><inattention><inattentiveness><innovate><innovation><innovative><insufficient sleep><muscular><pathophysiology><physical conditioning><physical health><sleep debt><sleep deficiency><sleep deficit><sleep improvement><sleep insufficiency><sleep loss><sleep physiology><sleep-related breathing disorder><sleepiness><wearable><wearable device><wearable electronics><wearable system><wearable technology><wearable tool><wearables>",Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Lung; Mental Health; Neurosciences; Sleep Research
Enhancing Diversity among Future ELSI Researchers,Enhancing Diversity among Future ELSI Researchers,"This application seeks to establish an R25 Research Education Program, “Enhancing
Diversity among Future ELSI Researchers,” with the long-term objective of helping to
diversify the pool of ELSI researchers and thus enrich ELSI scholarship. Our program
would draw on regional diversity to build a pipeline that identifies and recruits promising
undergraduates from populations historically underrepresented in ELSI and bioethics.
Our specific aims are: 1) To recruit undergraduate students from diverse,
underrepresented groups and backgrounds to explore and conduct research in
genomics and society studies (methods, skills, history, and content); 2) To mentor and
support small cohorts of interdisciplinary trainees, exposing them to career options in
genomics and society studies and sparking their interest in pursuing such a career, and
integrating them into local, regional, and national bioethics networks; and, 3) To nurture
and strengthen relationships between and among bioethics scholars and units at
universities in the Baltimore-DC area, creating and sustaining a regional pipeline for the
entry of students from diverse, underrepresented groups and backgrounds into
genomics and society studies, and the institutional structures and networks to support
them over time.
Through the R25, our program faculty and staff will create a 15-month training and
mentorship experience, the entry point of which will be a new Genomics and Society
division of the Johns Hopkins Diversity Summer Internship Program (SIP), offering an
intensive 10-week ELSI research experience. The BI will be able to offer multiple
research experiences through individual faculty research and through our CEER,
Bridging Infectious Disease, Genomics & Society (BRIDGES). Following the on-campus
summer program, students will continue their connection to the Hopkins Program
throughout the academic year, co-lead the planning of an activity (e.g., seminar, panel,
outreach event) related to their interests in Genomics and Society at their home
institution, and return to Hopkins and the Berman Institute for one week the following
summer for additional training and connection with the next cohort of trainees. The R25
will fund five trainees per year for five years. An additional trainee each year will be
funded by University of Maryland Baltimore County, one of our regional partners.","<Area><Baltimore><Bioethics><Biomedical Ethics><Communicable Diseases><Communication><Communities><County><Development><ELSI><Education Projects><Event><Exposure to><Faculty><Family><Funding><Future><Genetic Risk><Genomics><Goals><Health><Hereditary Disease><History><Home><Housing><Inborn Genetic Diseases><Individual><Infectious Disease Pathway><Infectious Diseases><Infectious Disorder><Infrastructure><Inherited disorder><Institution><Investigators><Learning><Maryland><Mentors><Mentorship><Methods><Policies><Population><Prevention><R25 Mechanism><R25 Program><Recording of previous events><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Risk><Scholarship><Science><Societies><Structure><Student recruitment><Students><Time><Training><Travel><Underrepresented Groups><Underrepresented Populations><Universities><career><cohort><developmental><education research><ethical legal and social><ethical, legal, and social implication><experience><faculty research><gene testing><gene-based testing><genetic testing><hereditary disorder><heritable disorder><histories><homes><improved><inborn error><infectious disease treatment><inherited diseases><inherited genetic disease><inherited genetic disorder><interest><outbreak containment><outbreak control><outbreak mitigation><outreach><programs><recruit><skill acquisition><skill development><skills><summer intern><summer internship><summer program><summer session><under representation of groups><under represented groups><under represented people><under represented populations><undergrad><undergraduate><undergraduate research experience><undergraduate research opportunities><undergraduate research programs><undergraduate student><underrepresentation of groups><underrepresented people>",Clinical Research; Genetics; Human Genome; Infectious Diseases
Provider Experiences with Puerto Rico Medicaid Following Multiple Disasters,Provider Experiences with Puerto Rico Medicaid Following Multiple Disasters,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Intense natural disasters including hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes have become more frequent and
closely spaced in recent years. Large scale natural disasters can severely damage and degrade health care
facility structural integrity and equipment, create environmental hazards, and negatively affect health service
delivery (e.g., cancelled surgeries; postponed preventive care; pharmacy closures; staffing, medication, and
medical supply shortages; large transient surges in emergency department volume) – all of which contribute to
increased stress among health care providers. Superimposing infectious disease epidemics on the natural
disasters further exacerbates stress on the health care system. Over the span of 3 years, Puerto Rico suffered
from 3 major back-to-back public health emergencies including 2 natural disasters and a pandemic. First,
Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017 causing major devastation throughout the island. Communities lost
access to essential services such as electricity, potable water, safe roads and bridges, and health care. Most
of the island’s public and private health care facilities closed or had limited capacity for months. Second, in
December 2019, a series of more than 500 quakes of magnitude 2.0 or greater struck Puerto Rico causing
more infrastructure damage to many struggling health facilities and leaving thousands homeless or living
outside in their yards. Third, Puerto Rico continues to deal with the novel coronavirus-19 (COVID-19)
pandemic. This study will provide a unique opportunity to understand the effects of 3 distinct public health
emergencies on a minority population with significant health and health care disparities. We have designed a
mixed methods, multi-level study that will triangulate quantitative and qualitative data to study the pre and post
effects of the 3 public health emergencies on Puerto Rico’s health care system’s preparedness, response, and
recovery efforts and how the emergencies have affected the resiliency, experiences, and utilization of the
island’s health care system. The study will use administrative utilization data from 50 general hospitals and 20
federally funded health centers on the island, qualitative interviews of health system leaders and providers, and
follow-up interviews of a representative cohort of 3,062 island adult residents. Using the Donabedian quality of
care model and concepts from an emerging literature on health system resilience as our study framework, we
will 1) identify factors that influenced the capacity of Puerto Rico’s health care system to prepare for, respond
to, and recover from Hurricane Maria, the earthquakes, and COVID-19, 2) model the cumulative effects of
multiple disasters on health system resiliency and how these effects interact, and 3) elicit lessons learned from
health care leaders and providers. We will synthesize the information from our triangulated research approach
to provide data driven recommendations for an effective and coordinated approach to mitigation,
preparedness, response, and resiliency under conditions of increasing frequency and intensity of disasters.",<21+ years old><Access to Care><Accident and Emergency department><Active

Hormonal Influences on Inflammation in Endometriosis,Hormonal Influences on Inflammation in Endometriosis,"It is estimated that around 10% of reproductive-age women of European ancestry, and 15% of women of Asian ancestry are impacted by endometriosis. In endometriosis, glandular epithelium and stroma closely resembling the cells of the endometrium grow outside of the uterine cavity, evading the typical cell-intrinsic (programmed cell death) and cell-extrinsic safeguards (such as immune surveillance) that should prevent cells from surviving at ectopic locations. Endometriosis causes myriad symptoms including infertility, dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps), deep dyspareunia (pain with deep penetration during sexual activity), dyschezia and dysuria (painful bowel movements and voiding), and chronic pelvic pain. Epidemiologic and genetic studies consistently find associations between endometriosis and inflammatory conditions such as asthma, irritable bowel syndrome and autoimmune disorders. Inflammation plays a central role in endometriosis, and the overarching hypothesis of this research is that studying risk loci shared by endometriosis and inflammatory conditions likely have a role for hormonal modulation, since endometriosis is an estrogen-driven disease. 
The goal of this proposal is to characterize key immune pathways that interact with hormonal responses in endometriosis. This will be achieved through large-scale population based genetic comorbidity studies and single cell systems biology methods to nominate shared risk genes and state-of-the-art single cell and spatial molecular profiling of follicular and luteal phase endometriosis. Key cell-cell signaling axes will be validated for their therapeutic potential using heterotypic in vitro and in vivo models of endometriosis. We will primarily focus on the proinflammatory IL1 pathway as a risk locus for endometriosis coincides with the IL1 gene family cluster. Based on integration of genome-wide risk data and single cell gene expression analysis of endometriosis we hypothesize that IL1A and/or IL1B expression by M2 macrophages combined with IL1 receptor expression in hormone-sensitive endometriosis epithelial cells is the pathway underlying risk at this locus. We will validate this hypothesis with multiomics and spatial profiling, and then dissect the roles of the key genes and cell populations using our existing state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo models. 
This research will validate IL1 signaling as a key therapeutic target for endometriosis-associated inflammation, and will likely nominate additional candidates. Subsequent research will focus on clinical translation of these results. Endometriosis represents the ideal system to study hormonal regulation of inflammation, and pleiotropy, and so we expect that the impact of this study will extend to other inflammatory traits that are more common in women, and to the post-GWAS field in general.",<3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><Adult females><Adult women><Affect><Age><Allergy><Anxiety><Apoptosis><Apoptosis Pathway><Asian Females><Asian

Fecal microbiota transplantation for auto-brewery syndrome,Fecal microbiota transplantation for auto-brewery syndrome,"ABSTRACT
 Auto brewery syndrome (ABS), also known as gut fermentation syndrome, is a rare condition in which a
dysfunctional intestinal microbiome produces ethanol, which is absorbed and results in intoxication. ABS may
result in behavioral, familial, social, and legal problems and is difficult to diagnose in part because of its rarity,
and because alcohol use disorder is common. Patients typically have “flares” of the condition, with episodes of
inebriation. ABS may be caused by yeast, sometimes brewer’s yeast or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but it may
also be associated with bacteria, such as Klebsiella species, E. coli or others, sometimes in combination. We
recruited 38 ABS patients and their household partners (HHP). Preliminary data showed that anaerobic
bioreactor cultures of ABS patient microbiota produced ex vivo significantly more ethanol than that of HHP.
Ethanol production was abrogated by antibiotic treatment. Metagenomic analysis of fecal samples showed higher
proportions of several bacterial species and of genomic DNA encoding alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in stool of
patients with ABS as compared with HHP. These findings indicate that pathologic production of ethanol is driven
by gut bacteria in most ABS patients. We have safely treated one ABS patient with an active flare using capsule
fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) under a single patient treatment IND. The patient achieved clinical
remission. We hypothesize that FMT in ABS patients is safe, tolerable and may result in an eradication of alcohol
producing microbes. We therefore propose a phase 1, open label safety and feasibility study of capsule-based
FMT in subjects with ABS under FDA and IRB supervision. Primary clinical outcomes are safety and feasibility;
secondary and exploratory endpoints include clinical outcomes and assessment of flares by blood and
breathalyzer ethanol monitoring, dietary intake, and microbiome and bioreactor assessment of stool samples.
These studies may reveal a new and safe therapeutic approach for patients with ABS, and will improve our
understanding of how gut microbial ethanol production contributes to the disease. Results from this safety and
tolerability study may lead to the conduct of a larger randomized controlled clinical trial for FMT use in patients
with ABS. The study may also inform our understanding of the effect of the microbiome on other hepatic and
metabolic disorders.",<21+ years old><Absolute ethanol><Adult><Adult Human><Adverse Experience><Adverse event><Alcohol Chemical Class><Alcohol dehydrogenase><Alcohol-NAD+ Oxidoreductase><Alcoholism><Alcohols><Alimentary Canal><Antibiotic Agents><Antibiotic Drugs><Antibiotic Therapy><Antibiotic Treatment><Antibiotics><Antifungal Therapy><Bacteria><Baker's Yeast><Behavioral><Bioreactors><Blood><Blood Circulation><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Bloodstream><Brewer's Yeast><California><Calymmatobacterium><Capsules><Carbohydrates><Case Study><Childhood><Clinical><Clinical Trials><Communicable Diseases><Data><Data Collection><Diagnosis><Dietary intake><Digestive Tract><Disease><Disease remission><Disorder><Donovania><E coli><E. coli><ETOH><Engraftment><Escherichia coli><Ethanol><Ethyl Alcohol><Exposure to><Family><Feasibility Studies><Feces><Fermentation><Flare><Functional Metagenomics><GI Tract><GI microbiome><GI microbiota><Gastrointestinal Tract><Gastrointestinal microbiota><Gastrointestinal tract structure><General Hospitals><Generalized Growth><Genomic DNA><Goals><Grain Alcohol><Growth><Hepatic Disorder><Household><IRB><IRBs><Infectious Disease Pathway><Infectious Diseases><Infectious Disorder><Ingestion><Institutional Review Boards><Intestinal><Intestines><Intoxication><Klebsiella><Laxative Preparation><Left><Legal><Liver diseases><Massachusetts><Measures><Medical><Metabolic Diseases><Metabolic Disorder><Metagenomics><Methylcarbinol><Microbe><Microbiomics><Miscellaneous Antibiotic><Mission><Monitor><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Organism><Outcome><Pathologic><Patient outcome><Patient-Centered Outcomes><Patient-Focused Outcomes><Patients><Phase><Population><Procedures><Production><Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials><Registries><Remission><S cerevisiae><S. cerevisiae><Saccharomyces cerevisiae><Safety><Short Bowel Syndrome><Supervision><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><Syndrome><Techniques><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Fungicides><Thesaurismosis><Tissue Growth><Universities><Visit><Writing><Yeasts><absorption><adulthood><alcohol use disorder><alimentary tract><anti-fungal><anti-fungal agents><anti-fungal drug><bacteria in the gut><bacterial disease treatment><bacterial infectious disease treatment><bowel><capsule><case report><clinical remission><cohort><digestive canal><digestive tract microbiome><enteric microbial community><enteric microbiome><enteric microbiota><ethanol use disorder><experience><fecal microbial community><fecal microbial transplantation><fecal microbiome transplantation><fecal microbiota><fecal microbiota transplant><fecal microbiota transplantation><fecal sample><fecal transplant><fecal transplantation><fungal infectious disease treatment><gDNA><gastrointestinal microbial flora><gastrointestinal microbiome><gut bacteria><gut commensal><gut community><gut flora><gut microbe community><gut microbes><gut microbial community><gut microbial composition><gut microbial consortia><gut microbial species><gut microbiome><gut microbiota><gut microbiotic><gut microflora><gut-associated microbiome><hepatic disease><hepatopathy><improved><ingest><intestinal biome><intestinal flora><intestinal microbes><intestinal microbiome><intestinal microbiota><intestinal microflora><intestinal tract microflora><laxative><liver disorder><living system><medical college><medical schools><metabolism disorder><metagenome sequencing><metagenomic sequencing><microbial><microbial consortia><microbial flora><microbiome><microbiome research><microbiome science><microbiome studies><microbioreactor><microbiota><microflora><multidisciplinary><multispecies consortia><ontogeny><open label><open label study><patient oriented outcomes><pediatric><primary end point><primary endpoint><randomized control clinical trial><rare condition><rare syndrome><recruit><restoration><safety and feasibility><safety outcomes><safety testing><school of medicine><short gut syndrome><social><stool><stool sample><stool specimen><surgery>,"Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Digestive Diseases; Microbiome; Patient Safety; Substance Misuse"
Alleviating antibiotic-induced microbiome dysfunction by quenching the microbial redox environment,Alleviating antibiotic-induced microbiome dysfunction by quenching the microbial redox environment,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Antibiotic-induced disruption (AID) of the gut microbiome can lead to severe conditions like C. diff colitis and 
may contribute to long-term health issues, including obesity and diabetes. There is an urgent need to develop 
interventions that mitigate these negative impacts while preserving the antibiotics' effectiveness. Our preliminary 
data suggest that dietary fiber reduces antibiotic disruption by decreasing the gut's redox potential, which in turn 
favors a low-energy, fermentative metabolic environment. This environment protects core microbiome members 
by reducing their metabolic rate and ATP production, which are linked to antibiotic susceptibility. In Aim 1, we 
will use an ex vivo microbiome culture approach to test endogenous redox sinks and small molecule regulators 
of bacterial redox as modulators of AID and determine the influence of these modulators on microbiome 
resilience, recovery, and pathobiont susceptibility. This research aims to identify mechanisms that can be 
translated into therapies for protecting the microbiome during antibiotic treatment, particularly for vulnerable 
populations.",<Acute><Aerobic><American><Anti-microbial susceptibility><Antibiotic Agents><Antibiotic Drugs><Antibiotic Resistance><Antibiotic Therapy><Antibiotic Treatment><Antibiotic susceptibility><Antibiotics><Automobile Driving><Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance><Basic Research><Basic Science><Body Tissues><C diff><C difficile><C. diff><C. difficile><Clostridioides difficile><Clostridium difficile><Colitis><Communities><Complex><Data><Diabetes Mellitus><Dietary Fiber><Dysfunction><Effectiveness><Environment><Fermentation><Fiber><Functional disorder><GI microbiome><Glycans><Health><Intermediary Metabolism><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Link><Measurement><Mediating><Metabolic><Metabolic Processes><Metabolism><Miscellaneous Antibiotic><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Obesity><Organ><Outcome><Oxidation-Reduction><Pathway interactions><Physiopathology><Plants><Polysaccharides><Predisposition><Probiotics><Production><Recovery><Redox><Research><Resistance to antibiotics><Resistant to antibiotics><Risk Reduction><Role><Solid><Supplementation><Susceptibility><Testing><Therapeutic><Time><Tissues><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Translating><Vulnerable Populations><adiposity><anti-microbial><antibiotic drug resistance><antibiotic resistant><antibiotic resistant bacteria><antimicrobial><bacterial antibiotic resistant><bacterial disease treatment><bacterial infectious disease treatment><bacterial resistance to antibiotic><combat><corpulence><diabetes><diet supplement><dietary supplements><digestive tract microbiome><driving><dysbacteriosis><dysbiosis><dysbiotic><enteric microbiome><evidence base><fighting><gastrointestinal microbiome><gut microbiome><gut-associated microbiome><improved><interventional strategy><intestinal biome><intestinal microbiome><metabolic rate><microbial><microbial imbalance><microbiome><microbiome components><microbiome members><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new therapeutics><new therapy><next generation therapeutics><novel><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><nutritional supplement><oxidation reduction reaction><pathobiont><pathophysiology><pathway><prebiotics><preservation><reduce risk><reduce risks><reduce that risk><reduce the risk><reduce these risks><reduces risk><reduces the risk><reducing risk><reducing the risk><resilience><resilient><respiratory><risk-reducing><small molecule><social role><translational impact><vulnerable group><vulnerable individual><vulnerable people><whole grain>,Antimicrobial Resistance; Biodefense and Related Countermeasures; Complementary and Integrative Health; Dietary Supplements; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Microbiome; Nutrition
Mechanisms of Reverse Transendothelial Migration in Arthritis Resolution,Mechanisms of Reverse Transendothelial Migration in Arthritis Resolution,"3. Abstract
Inflammation is a beneficial response to infection or tissue damage and mediates the removal of
microbial pathogens and restoration of the tissue to homeostasis. Occasionally the inflammatory
response does not resolve properly and becomes a chronic process, resulting in diseases such as
arthritis, asthma, and many others. Significant effort has gone into developing therapeutics to block
the development of inflammation; however, these approaches also increase the risk of serious
infection due to simultaneous inhibition of the host immune defense against microbial pathogens.
Recent work has demonstrated that the resolution of inflammation is an active and dynamic process.
Neutrophils recruited to the infected/damaged tissue phagocytose and kill invading bacteria, undergo
apoptosis, and are cleared by macrophages (efferocytosis). Efferocytosis is a key component of the
resolution process and induces a switch from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory processes in
macrophages. This switch results in decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, increased
production of anti-inflammatory mediators, enhanced efferocytosis, diminished neutrophil recruitment,
and promotes tissue healing and a return to homeostasis. Recently, however, another mechanism
has been described that may directly impact inflammation resolution, reverse transendothelial
migration of neutrophils (rTEM). In this mechanism, neutrophils that enter the tissue during
inflammatory responses do not die there, but rather re-enter the vasculature and travel to the lungs
before proceeding to the bone marrow where they ultimately die. This process appears to be at least
partially mediated by eicosanoids, specifically LTB4, PGE2, and LXA4. Our previous work has
demonstrated the failure of Lyme arthritis resolution in mice deficient in these inflammatory mediators.
Based upon our preliminary data, we hypothesize that neutrophils that enter tissues and encounter
microbes will remain in the tissues and undergo apoptosis there, if there are no microbes
encountered the neutrophils will undergo rTEM and exit the tissue. This proposal will investigate the
role of rTEM in inflammation resolution and the roles of LTB4, PGE2, and LXA4 in mediating this
response. Successful completion of these studies will provide new knowledge and understanding of
neutrophil trafficking during inflammation and the role of rTEM in inflammation resolution.","<15-LOX><15-Lipoxygenase><5,6,15-tri-HETE><5,6,15-triHETE><5,6,15-trihydroxy-7,9,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid><5-Lipoxygenase><Abscission><Anti-Inflammatories><Anti-Inflammatory Agents><Anti-inflammatory><Antibiotic Therapy><Antibiotic Treatment><Apoptosis><Apoptosis Pathway><Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase><Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase><Arachidonate Omega-6 Lipoxygenase><Arachidonic Acid 15-Lipoxygenase><Arachidonic Acid 5-Lipoxygenase><Arachidonic Acid Cyclooxygenase><Arthralgia><Arthritis><Arthritis in Lyme disease><Asthma><Atherosclerosis><Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease><Autoregulation><B burgdorferi><B. burgdorferi><Bacteria><Biochemical Pathway><Biologic Models><Biological Models><Blood Neutrophil><Blood Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil><Body Tissues><Bone Marrow><Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System><Borrelia burgdorferi><Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto><Borreliella burgdorferi><Brachydanio rerio><Bronchial Asthma><COX-1><COX-1 protein><COX-2><COX2><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cells><Characteristics><Chemotactic Cytokines><Chronic><Complex><Cyclo-Oxygenase><Cyclo-Oxygenase-1><Cyclooxygenase><Cyclooxygenase 3><Danio rerio><Data><Development><Dinoprostone><Disease><Disorder><Eicosanoids><Endothelium><Excision><Experimental Models><Extirpation><Failure><Fatty Acid Cyclo-Oxygenase><Fatty Acid Cyclooxygenase><Genetic><Homeostasis><Homologous Chemotactic Cytokines><Hydroperoxide Cyclase><Immune><Immunes><Infection><Inflammation><Inflammation Mediators><Inflammatory><Inflammatory Arthritis><Inflammatory Response><Intercrines><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Invaded><Joint Pain><Joints><KO mice><Kinetics><Knock-out Mice><Knockout Mice><Knowledge><LTA4 Synthase><LTB4><LXA4><Leukotriene A Synthase><Leukotriene A4 Synthase><Leukotriene A4 Synthetase><Leukotriene B-4><Leukotriene B4><Lipids><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Lyme Arthritis><Lyme Borreliosis><Lyme Disease><Lyme Disease Spirochete><Macrophage><Marrow Neutrophil><Mediating><Mediator><Metabolic Networks><Metabolic Pathway><Mice><Mice Mammals><Microbe><Model System><Murine><Mus><Mφ><NSAIDs><Neutrophil Infiltration><Neutrophil Recruitment><Neutrophilic Granulocyte><Neutrophilic Infiltrate><Neutrophilic Leukocyte><Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents><Null Mouse><Order Spirochaetales><PGE2><PGE2 alpha><PGE2alpha><PGH Synthase><PGH Synthase 1><PGH2 Synthetase><PGHS-2><PHS-2><PTGS2><PTGS2 gene><Pathology><Pathway interactions><Patients><Pharmacological Treatment><Physiological Homeostasis><Play><Polymorphonuclear Cell><Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes><Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils><Process><Production><Programmed Cell Death><Prostaglandin Cyclo-Oxygenase><Prostaglandin Cyclooxygenase><Prostaglandin E2><Prostaglandin E2 alpha><Prostaglandin E2alpha><Prostaglandin Endoperoxide Synthetase><Prostaglandin G-H Synthase><Prostaglandin G/H Synthase 1><Prostaglandin H Synthase><Prostaglandin H2 Synthase><Prostaglandin H2 Synthase 1><Prostaglandin H2 Synthetase><Prostaglandin Synthase><Prostaglandin Synthetase><Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase><Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase 1><Proteins><Regulation><Removal><Reporting><Resolution><Reticulocyte Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase><Risk><Role><SIS cytokines><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Site><Spirochaetales><Spirochetes><Sterility><Surgical Removal><Syndrome><Synovitis><Therapeutic><Tissues><Travel><Treatment Efficacy><Work><Zebra Danio><Zebra Fish><Zebrafish><arthritic><atheromatosis><atherosclerotic disease><atherosclerotic vascular disease><bacteria pathogen><bacterial disease treatment><bacterial infectious disease treatment><bacterial pathogen><biological signal transduction><chemoattractant cytokine><chemokine><chronic inflammatory disease><cyclo-oxygenase I><cyclooxygenase 1><cytokine><developmental><hCOX-2><healing><in vivo><in vivo Model><inflamed joint><inflamed synovial tissue><inflamed synovium><inflammatory mediator><injury to tissue><intervention efficacy><joint inflammation><joint swelling><lipoxin A4><lyme spirochete><microbe pathogen><microbial><microbial pathogen><microorganism><migration><mouse model><murine model><neutrophil><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new therapeutics><new therapy><next generation therapeutics><non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><pathogenic bacteria><pathogenic microbe><pathway><prevent><preventing><programs><prostaglandin H synthase-1><pulmonary><recruit><repair><repaired><resection><resolutions><response><restoration><social role><sterile><synovial inflammation><therapeutic efficacy><therapy efficacy><tick borne spirochete><tissue injury><trafficking>",Arthritis;

Understanding and Visualizing Emergency Department Clinician Well-Being and Strain,Understanding and Visualizing Emergency Department Clinician Well-Being and Strain,"Project Summary
Emergency department clinicians (ECs) regularly experience among the highest rates of psychological
distress. Manifesting in poor well-being and burnout, EC psychological distress can lead to adverse outcomes
for patient care, institutions (e.g., costly attrition), and individual ECs (e.g., illness and death). On-going
surveys conducted by the research team since 2020 have collected validated measures of an EC well-being
index and burnout score for three types of ECs (attendings, Advanced Practice Clinicians, and residents) at
seven emergency department locations at a large academic health system in upstate South Carolina.
Locations span urban to rural settings. Our interdisciplinary team proposes to link key contextual factors of
institutional stressors (including staffing strain and patient congestion) with coincident contextual factors
(including external pandemic status and individual demographic characteristics) to measure and visualize well-
being and burnout. Aim 1 will quantify the relationships between stressors and context with well-being and
burnout. Generalized linear mixed effects models will consider contributors of each predictor on both
outcomes, and factor analysis will compare the relative contribution of each predictor. Machine learning
methods will be used to develop a predictive model to evaluate future burnout risk. In Aim 2, we will develop a
visualization framework to display predictors and corresponding real-time predictions of well-being. Iterative
refinement will improve the visualization channels, user performance, and support accessibility. Mixed-method
validation with EC leadership will involve interviews to probe interpretation of data insights with the graphical
framework and eye-tracking to evaluate performance and speed. Consistent with the exploratory nature of an
R21, the visualization will be developed with EC-informed hypothetical values. A follow-on study will be
proposed to integrate the work both aims and to implement and evaluate the use of the visualization to improve
interpretation in practice. We anticipate that this research will both spur further work to develop decision-
support tools to address modifiable factors to improve well-being and have immediate impact in understanding
contributors to EC well-being and burnout. This work seeks to improve EC experience to interrupt the negative
feedback loop that drives adverse outcomes in patient care, EC turnover, and institutional goals to ultimately
improve EC well-being and patient care.",<2-dimensional><Absenteeism><Accident and Emergency department><Acute><Address><Affect><Aggregated Data><Application Context><COVID crisis><COVID epidemic><COVID incidence><COVID pandemic><COVID-19><COVID-19 case incidence><COVID-19 crisis><COVID-19 disease incidence><COVID-19 epidemic><COVID-19 era><COVID-19 global health crisis><COVID-19 global pandemic><COVID-19 health crisis><COVID-19 incidence><COVID-19 pandemic><COVID-19 period><COVID-19 public health crisis><COVID-19 years><CV-19><Categories><Cessation of life><Characteristics><Clinical><Communication><Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019><Crowding><Data><Data Aggregation><Data Analyses><Data Analysis><Data Banks><Databanks><Death><Demographic Factors><Development><Effectiveness><Emergencies><Emergency Department><Emergency Situation><Emergency room><Employee><Ensure><Factor Analyses><Factor Analysis><Feedback><Future><Goals><Health><Health system><Hospitals><Human><Human Resources><Individual><Institution><Interruption><Interview><Leadership><Link><Location><Machine Learning><Manpower><Measures><Methods><Modeling><Modern Man><Modification><Nature><Outcome><Patient Care><Patient Care Delivery><Patients><Performance><Personal Satisfaction><Policies><Position><Positioning Attribute><Predictive Factor><Predictive Value><Probabilistic Models><Probability Models><Process><Radar><Reporting><Research><Risk><Risk Factors><SARS-CoV-2 epidemic><SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis><SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic><SARS-CoV-2 incidence><SARS-CoV-2 pandemic><SARS-coronavirus-2 epidemic><SARS-coronavirus-2 pandemic><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 epidemic><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 pandemic><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic><Site><South Carolina><Speed><Statistical Models><Structure><Survey Instrument><Surveys><System><Time><Uncertainty><Validation><Visual><Visualization><Visualization software><Work><adverse consequence><adverse outcome><burn-out><burnout><care for patients><care of patients><caring for patients><computer based prediction><contextual factors><coronavirus disease 2019><coronavirus disease 2019 crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic><coronavirus disease 2019 global health crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic><coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic><coronavirus disease 2019 public health crisis><coronavirus disease crisis><coronavirus disease epidemic><coronavirus disease pandemic><coronavirus disease-19><coronavirus disease-19 global pandemic><coronavirus disease-19 pandemic><coronavirus infectious disease-19><cost><data depository><data interpretation><data repository><data set repository><dataset repository><developmental><doubt><empowerment><evidence base><experience><eye tracking><future implementation><improved><incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection><incident cases of SARS-CoV-2><indexing><insight><job environment><machine based learning><machine learning based method><machine learning based model><machine learning method><machine learning methodologies><machine learning model><machine statistical learning><pandemic><pandemic disease><personnel><predictive modeling><prisma><professional atmosphere><psychological distress><rural locality><rural place><rural setting><severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global health crisis><severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic><statistical and machine learning><statistical linear mixed models><statistical linear models><stressor><support tools><two-dimensional><usability><validations><visual tracking><visualization tool><well-being><wellbeing><work atmosphere><work environment><workplace climate><workplace environment>,Clinical Research; Emergency Care; Health Services; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Mental Health
Family-focused vs. Drinker-focused Smartphone Interventions to Reduce Drinking-related Consequences of COVID-19,Family-focused vs. Drinker-focused Smartphone Interventions to Reduce Drinking-related Consequences of COVID-19,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The combination of COVID-19 and alcohol/substance use disorders exacerbates a wide range of existing
problems, including the likelihood of contracting COVID and severity of consequences, pandemic-related
stresses that trigger alcohol and substance use, loss of jobs and healthcare access, increased interpersonal
violence, and overarching systemic inequities. Interventions are needed to address these serious problems,
which are likely to persist even after widespread availability of COVID vaccines.
In response to PAR 20-243, this R01 project is a Hybrid II RCT/implementation study modifying and testing two
of our alcohol smartphone interventions to address the fallout from COVID. We propose a 3-arm RCT
comparing a control vs. a drinker-focused intervention vs. a family-focused intervention. The drinker-focused
intervention (ACHESS-C) is an extension of our evidence-based Addiction–Comprehensive Health
Enhancement Support system (ACHESS), augmented with COVID resources. The family-focused intervention
(FamCHESS-C) combines ACHESS-C services with evidence-based Alcohol Behavioral Couple Therapy
services to help both drinker and partner with behavior change, relationship problems, and general well-being.
In the proposed 8-month trial plus 4-month follow-up, 198 dyads (drinker + family member) will be randomly
assigned to: 1) Smartphone control: both receive a smartphone with standard support and crisis numbers; 2)
ACHESS-C: drinker receives a phone with ACHESS-C, partner receives a phone with support and crisis
numbers; 3) Fam-CHESS-C: both receive phone with FamCHESS-C. The project has the following aims:
Aim 1: Complete refinements to the FamCHESS-C app.
Aim 2: Conduct a balanced RCT to test the following outcomes: Primary: 1) drinker % heavy drinking days, 2)
dyad quality of life. Secondary: 3) dyad relationship satisfaction, 4) dyad psychological/physical conflict, 5)
drinker no heavy drinking days, 6) drinker % days alcohol/drug use, 7) dyad COVID vaccination rates, 8)
drinker alcohol- and drug-related problems. Exploratory: 9) partner % days alcohol/drug use, 10) dyad crisis
healthcare use, 11) dyad technology satisfaction. We hypothesize that outcomes will be more favorable in
FamCHESS-C relative to ACHESS-C, and both will be more favorable relative to smartphone control.
Aim 3: Examine mediation effects of dyad's competence, relatedness, and motivation; drinker's interim change
in % days of alcohol and drug use, and extent of app use for comparisons of ACHESS-C and FamCHESS-C.
Examine moderation of effects of condition by drinker sex, severity of drinker’s baseline alcohol use, drinker
engagement in treatment for AUD/SUD, and dyad’s baseline relationship satisfaction.
Aim 4: Conduct a small-scale (20 dyads) formative evaluation using an implementation science model to
collect qualitative data on perceptions of difficulties and benefits of ACHESS-C and FamCHESS-C use.",<2019-nCoV vaccine><21+ years old><Active Follow-up><Address><Adult><Adult Children><Adult

Resource for Macromolecular Modeling and Visualization,Resource for Macromolecular Modeling and Visualization,"SUMMARY
The main mission of the P41 Biomedical Technology Research Resource for Macromolecular Modeling and
Bioinformatics (P41-GM104601) over the last three decades has been developing state of the art computational
technologies for biomolecular and cell simulations and visualization, implementing them in efﬁcient, economical,
user-friendly software solutions, and disseminating them to the biomedical community at no cost. The Resource
has enabled high-quality, rigorous research for the biomedical scientists who need to integrate molecular and
cell modeling, simulation, and visualization in their research, not only at diverse academic institutions, but also
in industry. The ﬂagship software programs, VMD and NAMD and their auxiliary plugins, are used currently
by more than 125,000 users and have received a staggering number of 57,000 citations (19,711 in 2018-2021
alone), reﬂecting the massive use of the technologies and programs developed by the Resource, and its sub-
stantial economies of scale. The Resource's partnership with the biomedical community resulted in the 2020
ACM Gordon Bell Special Prize for COVID-19 Research. Under the R24 mode of operation, a major goal of
the Resource will be to ensure that its software solutions remain current and available to its large user base on
existing and upcoming hardware platforms commonly used at local and institutional levels, and at national super-
computing centers, where a large fraction of the overall time is consumed by biomedical researchers using the
Resource's programs. Given the key position of these programs, several major supercomputing centers as well
as major hardware vendors have established strong relationships with the Resource, even directly supporting
software development and optimization. In addition, the Resource will ensure the utility of its programs by includ-
ing algorithmic changes/updates that are critical to applicability of the codes and/or demanded by the community.
The Resource will also sustain and expand its comprehensive user training program, empowered by an already
existing, large collection of online tutorials, case studies, and hands-on workshops. Another major activity of the
Resource will be to continue to support its users in the proper and efﬁcient application of the software programs
through customer support services and expanding and upgrading the documentation for the programs. The R24
Resource for Macromolecular Modeling and Visualization will be evaluated on a continuous basis by monitoring
quantitative metrics such as the number of its active users (users of multiple versions of software) and citations,
by conducting regular user surveys requesting input from the user community which will also assist in identifying
most critical features and improvements, and by the technical input from the external advisory board.",<Algorithms><Area><Automation><Bio-Informatics><Bioinformatics><Biological><Biomedical Research><Biomedical Technology><COVID-19><CV-19><Case Study><Cell Body><Cell model><Cells><Cellular model><Cloud Computing><Cloud Infrastructure><Code><Coding System><Collection><Communities><Computational algorithm><Computational toolkit><Computer Models><Computer Software Tools><Computer software><Computerized Models><Consumption><Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019><Cryo-electron Microscopy><Cryoelectron Microscopy><Data Collection><Documentation><Education><Educational Mainstreaming><Educational aspects><Educational workshop><Electron Cryomicroscopy><Emergent Technologies><Emerging Technologies><Ensure><Free Energy><Funding><Genome><Goals><Illinois><Image><Individual><Industry><Institution><Internet><Investigators><Knowledge><Ligands><Mainstreaming><Medicine><Membrane><Membrane Protein Gene><Membrane Proteins><Membrane-Associated Proteins><Methods><Mission><Modeling><Modernization><Molecular><Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry><Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry><Molecular Models><Monitor><NCRR><NIGMS><National Center for Research Resources><National Institute of General Medical Sciences><Performance><Plug-in><Position><Positioning Attribute><Prize><Procedures><Protein Dynamics><R24><Reproducibility><Research><Research Personnel><Research Resources><Researchers><Resources><Running><Sampling><Science><Scientist><Services><Software><Software Tools><Structural Biologist><Supercomputing><Surface Proteins><Survey Instrument><Surveys><System><Techniques><Technology><Time><Training><Training Activity><Training Programs><Update><Vendor><Visit><Visualization><WWW><Work><Workshop><Writing><achievement Mainstream Education><base><bases><biologic><biomedical scientist><case report><cloud based computing><cloud computer><community engagement><computational modeling><computational models><computational platform><computational toolbox><computational tools><computational toolset><computer algorithm><computer based models><computerized modeling><computerized tools><computing platform><coronavirus disease 2019><coronavirus disease-19><coronavirus infectious disease-19><cost><cryo-EM><cryoEM><cryogenic electron microscopy><cyber security><cybersecurity><data quality><develop software><developing computer software><empowerment><engagement with communities><experience><imaging><improved><internet security><interoperability><laptop><large data sets><large datasets><membrane structure><model-based simulation><models and simulation><molecular modeling><online tutorial><operation><operations><outreach><programs><screening><screenings><simulation><software development><software toolkit><structural biology><super computing><supercomputer><tool><training module><user friendly computer software><user friendly software><web><web server><web site><website><world wide web>,Bioengineering; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD)
Novel data and approaches for dynamic modeling of human behavior and infectious disease ecology,Novel data and approaches for dynamic modeling of human behavior and infectious disease ecology,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Demographic and social forces that influence human behavior fundamentally shape the epidemiology of
infectious diseases, but are often left out from mathematical models of disease transmission. Our recent work
has added to the growing body of evidence that patterns of how humans come into contact with one another,
and the adoption of behaviors to reduce transmission, are highly heterogeneous across individuals and groups
in a population; these behaviors are strongly influenced by how societies are structured and the socio-
economic, environmental, and political contexts in which epidemics occur. These same forces influence
patterns of exposure, susceptibility, and health outcomes. Human behavior also varies temporally and
spatially, leading to heterogeneities in transmission across space and time and the possibility of dynamical
feedback between the disease environment and the socio-demographic processes that influence human
behavior. Driven by the public health imperative to understand and address disparities in infection exposure
and risk, I propose to develop new models and methods for understanding how demographic and social
processes – from individual heterogeneities to large-scale patterns of population behavior – drive infectious
disease risk across scales. Specifically, my research group will develop a generalized framework for jointly
modeling human behavioral changes and disease dynamics, with bi-directional feedback between behavior
and the disease environment. We will also build and validate models for incorporating data on human mobility
and aggregation at the population level, while incorporating other extrinsic drivers of transmission such as
climate. We will parameterize these models by leveraging detailed human behavioral data from an ongoing
survey platform as well as novel sources of mobile phone and digital trace data, and validate model results by
fitting to epidemiological geo-located time series data. Our modeling approach will be flexible and dynamic,
allowing us to adapt it for specific pathogens and regions of interest. The project results will provide a better
understanding of the complex interactions between human behavior and the fundamental biological processes
underlying disease transmission, with the ultimate aim of guiding control efforts, designing equity-focused
interventions, and improving our ability to predict and prepare for outbreaks.

Social determinants of health and its impact on the interconnectedness between dental and systemic disease in women,Social determinants of health and its impact on the interconnectedness between dental and systemic disease in women,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The purpose of this administrative supplement proposal is to expand the studies in our parent project
R03DE033541-01, Leveraging All of Us data to unravel the interconnectedness between dental and systemic
disease. In the parent project, we are conducting a large-scale study leveraging and integrating high-quality
clinical (dental and medical), genomic, and demographic data available from >250,000 participants in the All of
Us Research Program (AoU) to identify host factors most likely contributing to a combined phenotype of dental
+ systemic disease. For this administrative supplement, we propose to expand the above studies to include AoU
participant survey data and employ an intersectional approach incorporating analyses of lifestyle, health care
access and utilization, and other social determinants of health (SDOH), in order to identify the SDOH domains
most likely to intersect with the dental and systemic conditions being assessed on the parent project, with a focus
on women’s health. Several lines of evidence have shown that SDOH are linked to differences in prevalence of
oral and systemic disease and reduced opportunities for health and health-related quality of life, particularly in
women. However, there is a lack of studies integrating individual biological (e.g., genomic, sex at birth), and
nonbiological (e.g. SDOH) aspects thereby precluding our ability to understand the full spectrum of the common
causes and pathways of dental/systemic disease and their interactions as contributors to differential disease
predisposition or manifestation. Here, we will test the hypothesis that non-biological SDOH factors may intersect
with biological sex to influence disease predisposition and/or clinical manifestation. We will integrate SDOH data
available for the AoU participants that are being used in our parent project to the clinical and genomic data
obtained and apply a multidimensional analysis framework to explore the intersectional effects of biological and
non-biological (SDOH) factors and contributing to a combined phenotype of dental + systemic disease in males
and females. This study represents a major advance in the field by creating a roadmap for integrating clinical,
genomic, demographic and survey data from a large and diverse population in the AoU program to develop a
more comprehensive picture of the factors contributing to oral and systemic health/disease relationships between
the sexes. This proposal addresses the Trans-NIH Strategic Plan for Women’s Health Research goal #1
Advancing rigorous research, and the NIDCR’s Strategic Priorities #1 Integrate Oral and General Health, and #2
Precision Dental Medicine.",<Address><Administrative Supplement><Affect><Age><All of Us Program><All of Us Research Program><All of Us Research Project><Animals><AoURP><Behavioral><Biologic Factor><Biological><Biological Factors><Birth><Censuses><Chronic><Clinical><Clinical Data><Communicable Diseases><Data><Dental><Dental Records><Development><Differences between sexes><Differs between sexes><Disease><Disorder><Disproportionate number of females><Disproportionate number of women><Disproportionately affects females><Disproportionately affects women><Disproportionately impacts females><Disproportionately impacts women><Disproportionately in females><Disproportionately in women><Drugs><Environment><Epidemiologic Research><Epidemiologic Studies><Epidemiological Studies><Epidemiology><Epidemiology Research><Ethnic Group><Ethnic People><Ethnic Population><Ethnic individual><Ethnicity People><Ethnicity Population><Female><Female Health><Frequencies><Gender><Gene variant><Genetic><Genetic Diversity><Genetic Variation><Genetic study><Genomics><Goals><Health><Health Care Utilization><Host Factor><Host Factor Protein><Individual><Infectious Disease Pathway><Infectious Diseases><Infectious Disorder><Inflammatory><Integration Host Factors><Learning><Life Style><Lifestyle><Link><Medical><Medical Records><Medication><Medicine><Mouth Diseases><NIDCR><NIDR><NIH><National Institute of Dental Research><National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research><National Institutes of Health><Oral><Oral Cavity Disease><Oral Cavity Disorder><Oral Disease><Oral Disorder><Oral health><Outcome><Participant><Parturition><Pathogenesis><Pathway interactions><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phenotype><Play><Population><Population Heterogeneity><Position><Positioning Attribute><Precipitating Factors><Predisposing Factor><Predisposition><Prevalence><Preventative strategy><Prevention strategy><Preventive strategy><Racial Group><Reporting><Research><Severities><Sex Differences><Sexual differences><Strategic Planning><Survey Instrument><Surveys><Susceptibility><Systemic disease><Testing><Tooth Diseases><Tooth Disorder><United States><United States National Institutes of Health><Woman><Women's Health><Work><access to health care><access to healthcare><accessibility of health care><accessibility to health care><accessibility to healthcare><ages><allele variant><allelic variant><biologic><biological sex><community factor><community-level factor><data integration><demographics><dental disease><dental disorder><dental health><dental infection><developmental><dimensional analysis><disease phenotype><diverse populations><drug/agent><dysbacteriosis><dysbiosis><dysbiotic><environmental stresses><environmental stressor><epidemiologic><epidemiologic investigation><epidemiological><epidemiology study><ethnic subgroup><ethnicity group><experience><female bias><female preponderance><genetic variant><genomic data><genomic data-set><genomic dataset><genomic variant><health care access><health care availability><health care service access><health care service availability><health care service use><health care service utilization><health data><health related quality of life><healthcare access><healthcare accessibility><healthcare availability><healthcare service access><healthcare service availability><healthcare service use><healthcare service utilization><healthcare utilization><heterogeneous population><improved><insight><male><men><microbial><microbial imbalance><mouth disorder><parent award><parent project><pathway><patient centered><patient oriented><phenotypic data><population diversity><programs><racial population><racial subgroup><sex><sex based differences><sex related variation><sex variable><sex variation><sex-dependent differences><sex-related differences><sex-related variable><sex-specific differences><social health determinants><social influence><treatment strategy><varies by sex><women's preponderance>,"Behavioral and Social Science; Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Disease; Genetics; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Infectious Diseases; Precision Medicine; Prevention; Social Determinants of Health; Women's Health Research"
Pilot multisite randomized controlled trial of yoga to reduce depression inadolescents,Pilot multisite randomized controlled trial of yoga to reduce depression inadolescents,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Even before the onset of the COVID pandemic, adolescent depression has been increasing, and health dispar-
ities and disparities in access to treatment have continued to widen. Thus, there is a clear need for innovative,
accessible treatments for depressed adolescents, including treatments that do not rely on a limited pool of child
and adolescent health providers. Yoga-based interventions (YBIs) have shown promise for adult depression.
Several attractive aspects of yoga include its: 1) availability throughout the U.S.; 2) accessibility via online clas-
ses; 3) independence from an overburdened mental health care system; and 4) generalizability--yoga students
state that they use mindfulness and breathing practices to cope with stress in everyday life. Funded by a
NCCIH R34, we developed a YBI for depressed adolescents, and demonstrated that this in-person program
was acceptable and feasible in a small sample (n=11) of depressed adolescents as well as in a pilot RCT
(n=42) of YBI vs. an existing evidence-based treatment, group cognitive-behavioral therapy (gCBT). The RCT
classes were initially in-person, but we migrated to synchronous online classes due to COVID-19. In the RCT,
participants within each study arm showed decreased depression symptoms and increased self-compassion
over time. Most a priori feasibility and acceptability targets were met (e.g., recruitment, retention, expectancy,
satisfaction, credibility, attendance, and adherence). However, participants did not engage in home (outside-of-
class) practice at the targeted rate. Thus, in the present proposal we have modified our protocol to provide an
opportunity for twice-weekly supervised yoga practice (one in-person class on the weekend, and one virtual
class midweek). Our prior pilot trial was based at only one site (Providence RI) with one primary YBI instructor
and two gCBT leaders. Multiple sites and instructors/leaders, and recruitment of a more racially and ethnically
diverse sample, will be important to demonstrate generalizability and to enhance effectiveness. We now pro-
pose to conduct a two-phase multi-site feasibility trial. Phase 1 (n=20) will focus on increasing accessibility and
feasibility of YBI for particular groups of adolescents. We will conduct individual interviews with teens who were
less represented in our pilot trial (African-American/Black, Asian American, and male adolescents) to gain their
feedback on yoga based interventions, with a focus on increasing accessibility and feasibility for adolescents
with these identities. Phase 2 (n=128) will be a pilot RCT of YBI vs. gCBT at two geographically distinct sites:
Boston, MA and Columbus, OH. Given the rising prevalence of adolescent depression and the existence of
established, efficacious group treatment for depression (i.e., group CBT), we determined that a non-inferiority
trial represented the most ethical way to proceed. We will incorporate lessons learned from this study to further
refine study materials and create a template for onboarding multiple future sites. This project will prepare us to
conduct a multisite, adequately powered, non-inferiority RCT of YBI vs. gCBT in depressed adolescents.","<21+ years old><Access to Care><Adherence><Adolescent><Adolescent Youth><Adult><Adult

"Engaging People Who Use Drugs in Harm Reduction Service Delivery: An Intravention to Reduce Risk of HIV, HCV, Overdose, and Injection-related Infections in Rural Appalachia","Engaging People Who Use Drugs in Harm Reduction Service Delivery: An Intravention to Reduce Risk of HIV, HCV, Overdose, and Injection-related Infections in Rural Appalachia","The proposed project will test an innovative, peer-driven approach to address unmet harm reduction needs in
two rural Kentucky counties at the epicenter of the opioid/stimulant epidemic, with the aim of reducing risk for
overdose (OD), hepatitis C (HCV), skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), and HIV. Research has shown that
these counties and the encompassing rural Appalachian region have high rates of drug-related harms including
ODs, HCV, opioid use disorder, methamphetamine use, and SSTIs, and are at high risk for an HIV outbreak
among people who inject drugs (PWID). In 2020, Kentucky was one of just seven states named in the Ending
the HIV Epidemic initiative based on the percentage of new HIV diagnoses occurring in rural areas. In an effort
to reduce drug-related harms, Kentucky has opened brick-and-mortar syringe service programs (SSPs) in 65
of its 120 counties, including those involved in this proposal. Unfortunately, this infrastructure remains vastly
under-utilized. Our ongoing research has shown that only 50% of PWID are using the SSP, primarily due to
fear of being seen by someone they know, concerns around law enforcement or child protective services, and
anticipated judgment by staff, barriers similar to those reported elsewhere in the region. State data have
revealed challenges with client retention, particularly in rural communities, and substantial recent declines in
the number of SSP clients and visits. Together, these data highlight an urgent need to address barriers to SSP
service utilization in rural Appalachia and expand service reach to the growing number of rural PWID with
unmet harm reduction needs. To best overcome barriers related to privacy and fear of stigma and judgment,
models must meet PWID where they are by engaging those whom they trust. For decades, scientists have
called for the expansion of “intravention” wherein members of communities at risk are engaged in
implementing the interventions intended to improve their community’s health. Engaging PWID who are trusted
members of the community honors harm reduction principles and is critical to intravention success, as they are
viewed as more credible, are likely to engage those most marginalized, and can intervene when and where
risks are highest. Research has established that intraventions are effective, yet they have been far under-
utilized in rural communities. In response, we will partner with local PWID and agency partners to co-develop
and tailor a peer-driven, evidence-based intravention that engages PWID as interventionists’ to reach
individuals with unmet harm reduction needs in rural Appalachia. The adapted intravention, hereafter referred
to as ASSIST, will address interventionists’ knowledge gaps related to OD, HCV, SSTIs, and HIV risk reduction
and equip them with harm reduction supplies for use and distribution. We will evaluate ASSIST’s impact on

Designing for sustainability: Co-designing and testing the efficacy of a web-based toolkit to improve cancer-related emotional distress and anxiety for rural older cancer survivors,Designing for sustainability: Co-designing and testing the efficacy of a web-based toolkit to improve cancer-related emotional distress and anxiety for rural older cancer survivors,"PROJECT SUMMARY: From 2019-2022, telehealth uptake in rural health clinics surged by 73%. This rapid acceleration
in telehealth uptake was driven by COVID-19 precautions, the permanent closure of rural hospitals, a massive shortage
of mental health professionals, and $1.5 billion in federal investment in broadband access. However, despite the
availability and investment in telehealth, many rural patients, especially rural older adults, lack the digital literacy
necessary to fully utilize it, exacerbating barriers to quality healthcare and hindering the potential benefits of telehealth
in expanding access to quality healthcare. Increasing rurality and older age are associated with lower digital literacy and
telehealth adoption, and rural older cancer survivors (ROCS) face compounded vulnerabilities, which are exacerbated
by the reduced access to mental health professionals in rural areas for ROCS experiencing cancer-related distress.
Cancer-related distress is stress and anxiety related to a cancer diagnosis and treatment. Telehealth providing support
for cancer-related distress is a promising strategy to expand care in rural areas with a shortage of mental health
professionals. Still, without interventions to address digital literacy, many ROCS will go without this critical care, thus
compromising their overall cancer outcomes. To this end, we developed CONNECT, a web-based toolkit targeting
digital literacy and mental health support for ROCS, employing a user-centered design approach and the Designing for
Dissemination and Sustainability logic model. CONNECT addresses digital literacy and supports for cancer-related
distress management through interactive activities for setting up telehealth visits, accessing educational materials about
cancer-related distress, and providing individualized mental health resource recommendations. Feedback from our pilot
usability study was positive, reporting high levels of acceptability and usability from users. Yet, additional comments
underscored the need to enhance the platform with opportunities to engage caregivers remotely but synchronously to
provide additional real-time digital literacy assistance. Building on this pilot, we propose to adapt CONNECT using a co-
design process to include recommendations from our pilot, namely, functions that permit synchronous communication
with a caregiver (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will conduct a 2-arm randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the
adapted CONNECT for improving cancer-related distress among ROCS. We will randomly assign ROCS-caregiver
dyads (N=274) to a CONNECT intervention group (N=134) or enhanced standard of care (n=134). Dyads in the
intervention group will receive usual care and engage with CONNECT. Participants in the enhanced standard of care
group will receive usual care and survivorship care and cancer-related distress literature. Our primary outcome is levels
of cancer-related distress. We will secondarily assess digital literacy and healthcare engagement, clinical care, and
existing social support networks every 4 months after enrollment for 12 months. In Aim 3, we will use exit interviews in
Aims 1 and 2 with a subsample of participants to examine outcomes related to implementation and potential
sustainability in the rural multi-level context. Completing these aims will inform future integration of CONNECT across
multiple healthcare systems for a multi-site scaled-up effectiveness RCT.",<2 arm RCT><2 arm randomized control trial><2 arm randomized controlled trial><65 and older><65 or older><65 years of age and

Molecular Mechanisms of Signal Transduction by Two-Component Regulatory Systems,Molecular Mechanisms of Signal Transduction by Two-Component Regulatory Systems,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Signal transduction and protein phosphorylation are vital for life. The ability to respond to stimuli is
considered a key characteristic of life. Cells detect new conditions, transduce relevant information into a
usable form, and execute appropriate responses. Errors in signal transduction can cause reduced fitness or
disease. A common strategy is to represent information by the specific and transient placement of phosphoryl
groups on proteins. Many pathogens use phosphorylation to regulate virulence in response to host parameters.
Thus, understanding the mechanisms, regulation, and impact of phosphoryl group transfer among microbial
signaling proteins is of fundamental interest, and of practical significance to infectious diseases of humans.
Kinetics of two-component regulatory system (TCS) phosphotransfer reactions are crucial to biological
function. TCSs are widely used for signal transduction by microorganisms and plants (but not humans) to
control virulence, physiology, development, behavior, etc. Sensor kinases detect stimuli and internalize input
on intracellular dimerization and histidine phosphorylation (DHp) domains using phosphoryl groups. Receiver
domains catalyze transfer of phosphoryl groups from sensor kinases to themselves and from themselves to
water to modulate response regulator output. Receiver domains can also reversibly exchange phosphoryl
groups with histidine-containing phosphotransfer (Hpt) domains to create more complex phosphorelays. The
kinetics of phosphotransfer reactions are crucial to synchronize responses with stimuli and can differ by many
orders of magnitude between TCSs that control biological functions operating on different timescales.
Innovative uses of protein sequence data to design experiments that provide insight into all TCSs. We
deliberately confront a key challenge arising from the genomic era - the large and increasing gap between the
number of identified TCSs and the number that can reasonably be studied experimentally. Our long-term goal
to comprehensively understand the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction in TCSs demands a
fundamentally different and less granular approach than studying one TCS at a time. We focus on aspects of
DHp, Hpt, and receiver domains that vary between TCSs, using bioinformatics to guide our experiments to
unravel the factors governing TCS specialization. We will determine mechanisms and factors that modulate
phosphotransfer reactions between DHp, Hpt, and receiver domains (AIM 1); DHp phosphatase activity (AIM
2); and receiver domain autocatalytic reactions, which form the basis of TCS signaling (AIM 3).
High impact on TCSs and beyond. TCS proteins are among the most abundant in nature. Completion of
our Aims will help predict the properties of uncharacterized TCSs from amino acid sequence features, facilitate
systems and synthetic biology applications of TCSs, and potentially aid design of antibiotics that target TCSs.
Robust predictive capability could mitigate limited experimental capacity to investigate uncharacterized TCSs.
The innovative bioinformatics strategies used and refined here can also guide study of any protein domain.",<Agriculture><Amino Acid Sequence><Amino Acids><Antibiotic Agents><Antibiotic Drugs><Antibiotics><Architecture><Behavior><Bio-Informatics><Biochemical><Biochemistry><Bioinformatics><Biological Chemistry><Biological Function><Biological Process><Biophysics><Biotech><Biotechnology><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cells><Characteristics><Cluster Analyses><Cluster Analysis><Communicable Diseases><Complex><DNA Molecular Biology><Data><Dephosphorylation><Development><Devices><Dimerization><Disease><Disorder><Drugs><Engineering / Architecture><Enzyme Kinetics><Eukaryota><Eukaryote><Exhibits><Experimental Designs><Foundations><Genetic><Genomics><Goals><High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing><High-Throughput Sequencing><Histidine><Hydrogen Oxide><Infectious Disease Pathway><Infectious Diseases><Infectious Disorder><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigation><Kinases><Kinetics><Life><Measures><Medication><Medicine><Methods><Miscellaneous Antibiotic><Molecular><Molecular Biology><Natural Resources><Nature><Organism><Output><Peptide Domain><Persons><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phenotype><Phosphatases><Phosphohydrolases><Phosphomonoesterases><Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases><Phosphorylation><Phosphotransferase Gene><Phosphotransferases><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiology><Plants><Position><Positioning Attribute><Predisposition><Primary Protein Structure><Productivity><Prokaryotae><Prokaryotic Cells><Property><Protein Dephosphorylation><Protein Dimerization><Protein Domains><Protein Family><Protein Phosphorylation><Proteins><Public Health><Reaction><Regulation><Research><SEQ-AN><Sequence Analyses><Sequence Analysis><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Signaling Factor Proto-Oncogene><Signaling Pathway Gene><Signaling Protein><Stimulus><Susceptibility><System><Systems Biology><Tertiary Protein Structure><Testing><Therapeutic Agents><Time><Transphosphorylases><Virulence><Water><Work><aminoacid><antibiotic design><biological signal transduction><biophysical foundation><biophysical principles><biophysical sciences><defined contribution><design><designing><developmental><dimension reduction><dimensionality reduction><drug/agent><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><fitness><human disease><information processing><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><interest><living system><loss of function><microbe pathogen><microbial><microbial pathogen><microorganism><pathogen><pathogenic microbe><prokaryote><protein function><protein sequence><reduce data dimension><reduce dimensionality><response><sensor><structural biology><synthetic biology><usability>,Infectious Diseases
Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment in Patients with AIDS-Associated EBV+ Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma,Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment in Patients with AIDS-Associated EBV+ Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC) is in its 44th year as an NCI-designated
comprehensive cancer center, having received an “exceptional” overall merit descriptor in its last two reviews in
2010 and 2015, and is requesting continued federal support for the next five years. The OSUCCC mission
remains to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality through basic, population, translational and clinical research.
Through thoughtful strategic planning, attention to the cancer burden in the catchment area (the state of Ohio),
effective organizational capabilities and targeted investment, the Director and his Senior Leadership team will
enable the OSUCCC to advance collaborative cancer research with local, national, and global partners on
initiatives of the highest priority to the OSUCCC. The 293 full and introductory members are currently served by
16 full and two developing shared resources and are distributed among our five Research Programs: Cancer
Biology (formerly Molecular Biology and Cancer Genetics), Cancer Control, Leukemia Research, Molecular
Carcinogenesis and Chemoprevention and Translational Therapeutics. The OSUCCC fosters collaborative basic
research and implements strategies that advance and translate early discovery into clinical and population-based
research and addresses the needs of our catchment area through research, engagement, and outreach, from
etiology through prevention, treatment and survivorship regarding the major cancers afflicting our catchment
area population. The OSUCCC trains the next generation of cancer-focused scientists and clinicians through
new and established programs focused on integrating training for collaborative research efforts. Under the
leadership of a new Director, Raphael Pollock, MD, PhD, The OSUCCC supports innovative research efforts
within four strategic planning priorities: immuno-oncology, cancer engineering, translational genomics and
cancer prevention and survivorship. Since the last CCSG competitive renewal, the OSUCCC has shown
significant growth demonstrated by: 1) the recruitment of 108 basic, population, and translational science faculty
who are OSUCCC members; 2) the addition of 94,647 ft2 research and administrative space under the full control
of the OSUCCC Director; 3) a 16% increase in direct cancer-related funding to $75.4M, with $44.3M coming
from the NCI; 4) accrual of 14,996 patients to interventional clinical trials (5,648 accruals to therapeutic trials); 5)
increased collaborative and impactful research demonstrated by 3,477 peer-reviewed publications in which 74%
of manuscripts are multi-institutional and 85% are collaborative (i.e., inter-, intra-programmatic or multi-
institutional); 497 are published in journals with an impact factor >10; 6) the addition of two new shared resources
at an institutional investment of $1.3M; and 7) preclinical and clinical development of an FDA approved drug
which has changed the treatment for CLL and other blood cancers. With new recruits and strong institutional and
philanthropic support in place, the OSUCCC is building upon the momentum and poised in the next five years to
take significant steps toward achieving our mission and our broad vision of living in a cancer-free world.","<AIDS><AIDS Malignancy Consortium><AIDS Virus><AIDS associated cancer><AIDS lymphoma><AIDS

Let's Talk: Overcoming barriers to the uptake of cascade screening through a stakeholder-informed online intervention,Let's Talk: Overcoming barriers to the uptake of cascade screening through a stakeholder-informed online intervention,"ABSTRACT
The impact of genetic testing for disease prevention hinges on cascade screening, the process of
systematically identifying and testing relatives in families with a genetic condition. Lynch syndrome is a
genetic condition that confers an increased lifetime risk of cancer. Unfortunately, only half of first-degree family
members with Lynch syndrome receive cascade screening, representing a missed opportunity in cancer
prevention. Let's Talk is a novel intervention to promote and support cascade screening in families with Lynch
syndrome. Developed using intervention mapping, a 6-step, stakeholder-engaged methodology for developing
theory-based interventions, the workbook intervention addresses barriers to cascade screening through
information chunking, guided practice, planning coping responses, and gain frame messaging for patients, their
provider and family. Preliminary data have demonstrated that the content of Let's Talk, in a paper-based
format, is acceptable to patients with Lynch syndrome, and all patients reported that they would recommend its
use to someone recently diagnosed with Lynch syndrome. In addition, all patients in our usability study
endorsed the development of an interactive, online version, which could improve dissemination, given changes
in genetic counseling workflows due to COVID-19, and could facilitate ongoing patient support through follow-
up messaging. Thus, the overall objective of this project is to (1) adapt and refine an interactive online format
for Let's Talk based on patient preferences and user feedback, and (2) pilot test Let's Talk to assess its
feasibility by measuring implementation (primary) and effectiveness outcomes. The expected outcomes of this
project will move the field forward in tackling challenges associated with cascade screening in Lynch syndrome
and other hereditary conditions. This work will provide foundational data for a future R01 application to test the
effectiveness and implementation of Let's Talk for increasing cascade screening uptake and identification of
relatives with Lynch syndrome across diverse care settings.","<1st degree relative><Active Follow-up><Address><Affect><Blood Tests><COVID crisis><COVID epidemic><COVID pandemic><COVID-19><COVID-19

A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Impact of Treatment of Asymptomatic Bacteriuria on Low Birth Weight,A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Impact of Treatment of Asymptomatic Bacteriuria on Low Birth Weight,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) in pregnancy has been associated with an increased incidence of neonatal
morbidity including preterm birth and low birth weight (LBW) and maternal morbidity including pyelonephritis.
Hypothesis: Treatment of pregnant individuals with AB will reduce the incidence of newborns with LBW in
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Significance: LBW occurs in more than 20 million newborns each year globally and is associated with an
increased risk of neonatal death and lifetime morbidity. This proposal will examine the impact of treating AB
in pregnant individuals in LMICs on the incidence of LBW and serious maternal and neonatal morbidity.
Investigators: Dr. Chisholm (mPI) is an academic maternal-fetal medicine subspecialist with 5 years of
experience as a member of the NICHD Global Network for Women’s and Children’s Health Research (GN)
and investigator in global clinical trials. Dr. McClure (mPI) is a perinatal epidemiologist and PI of the Data
Coordinating Center who has more than 20 years of experience contributing to the leadership of the GN and
overseeing research in LMICs. Co-Is Dr. Petri at the University of Virginia and Dr. Haque at the International
Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh, have collaborated for 30 years on maternal–child
health and infectious diseases research.
Innovation: The proposed study will address calls from the World Health Organization, USPSTF, and
numerous professional societies for data evaluating the impact of treatment for AB in contemporary obstetric
populations in LMICs where the burden of LBW and associated neonatal morbidity is highest and where the
practice of screening for AB is less widely implemented.
Approach: We will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-arm trial to address the
following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Test the primary outcome of the trial, which is the impact of antibiotic (nitrofurantoin)
treatment of AB on LBW. This will be done by comparing the incidence of LBW between those randomized
to receive nitrofurantoin and those randomized to receive placebo.
Specific Aim 2: Test the secondary outcome of the trial, which is the impact of antibiotic treatment of AB on
serious maternal morbidity in pregnancy. This will be done by comparing maternal morbidity between those
randomized to receive nitrofurantoin and those randomized to receive placebo. We hypothesize that
treatment of AB in pregnancy will reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis and pre-eclampsia.","<0-4 weeks old><Address><Antibiotic Agents><Antibiotic Drugs><Antibiotic Therapy><Antibiotic Treatment><Antibiotics><Applications Grants><Bacteria><Bacteriuria><Bangladesh><Birth Weight><Child Health><Clinical Treatment><Clinical Trials><Collaborations><Conduct Clinical Trials><Data><Data Coordinating Center><Data Coordination Center><Discipline of obstetrics><Double-Blind Method><Double-Blind Study><Double-Blinded><Double-Masked Method><Double-Masked Study><EPH Gestosis><Enrollment><Epidemiologist><Foundations><Gestation><Grant Proposals><Health Policy><Incidence><Individual><Infectious Diseases / Laboratory><Infectious Diseases Research><Infrastructure><International><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Investigation><Investigators><LMIC><Lead><Leadership><Literature><Low Birth Weight Infant><Macrobid><Macrodantin><Maternal and Child Health><Maternal-fetal medicine><Miscellaneous Antibiotic><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Mothers><NICHD><National Institute of Child Health and Human Development><National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development><Neonatal Mortality><Newborn Infant><Newborns><Nitrofurantoin><Obstetrics><Outcome Measure><Participant><Patient Recruitments><Pb element><Perinatal><Peripartum><Placebo Control><Placebos><Population><Postpartum Period><Practice Guidelines><Pre-Eclampsia><Preeclampsia><Pregnancy><Pregnancy Toxemias><Pregnant Women><Premature Birth><Prematurely delivering><Preterm Birth><Principal Investigator><Professional Organizations><Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis><Pyelonephritis><Ramp><Randomized><Randomized, Controlled Trials><Registries><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Risk><Sham Treatment><Site><Testing><Training><U.S. Preventative Services Task Force><U.S. Preventative Task Force><U.S. Preventive Services Task Force><U.S. Preventive Task Force><US Preventative Services Task Force><US Preventative Task Force><US Preventive Health Services Task Force><US Preventive Services Task Force><US Preventive Task Force><USPSTF><United States Preventative Services Task Force><United States Preventative Task Force><United States Preventive Services Task Force><United States Preventive Task Force><Universities><Urine><Virginia><Woman><Work><World Health Organization><arm><bacterial disease treatment><bacterial infectious disease treatment><data management and coordinating center><data management center><death among neonates><death among newborns><death in neonates><death in newborn><development policy><diarrheal disease><diarrheal illness><double-blind placebo control trial><double-blind placebo controlled trial><double-masked controlled trial><enroll><expectant mother><expecting mother><experience><health care policy><healthcare policy><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><innovate><innovation><innovative><international center><interventional strategy><kidney infection><low and middle-income countries><low birth weight><low birthweight><maternal morbidity><measurable outcome><member><mortality among neonates><mortality among newborns><mortality in neonates><mortality in newborns><neonatal death><neonatal demise><neonatal health><neonatal morbidity><newborn child><newborn children><newborn death><newborn health><newborn morbidity><newborn mortality><outcome measurement><participant recruitment><placebo controlled><post-partum><pre-eclamptic><pregnancy toxemia/hypertension><pregnant><pregnant mothers><premature childbirth><premature delivery><preterm delivery><primary outcome><professional association><professional membership><professional society><prospective><randomisation><randomization><randomized control trial><randomly assigned><screening><screenings><secondary outcome><sham therapy><treatment effect><trial regimen><trial treatment>","Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Infectious Diseases; Maternal Health; Maternal Morbidity and Mortality; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Pregnancy; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn; Prevention; Urologic Diseases; Women's Health Research"

Alcohol assoCiated gut Dysbiosis and CVD in HIV (the AC/DC HIV study),Alcohol assoCiated gut Dysbiosis and CVD in HIV (the AC/DC HIV study),"PROJECT ABSTRACT: Among people with HIV infection (PWH), hazardous drinking is a common, modifiable
risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death. Both alcohol and HIV cause gut dysbiosis. Gut
dysbiosis is associated with systemic inflammation and harmful metabolites, each of which is associated with
CVD and death. However, the specific bacterial shifts that drive dysbiosis and its harmful effects among PWH
who drink are unclear. Our overarching model posits that alcohol associated gut dysbiosis leads to a
reduction in specific species of butyrate-producing bacteria, lowering butyrate levels and increasing
trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). These mechanisms contribute to microbial translocation and vascular
inflammation. Ultimately, these processes promote CVD and excess mortality. This application leverages rich
existing data from three fully harmonized NIAAA cohort studies (ACME HIV, U01AA026222; TMAO HIV,
R01AA025859; META HIV, P01AA029542) in response to NOT-AA-23-011 requesting proposals for use of
existing data and biospecimens in alcohol research. We hypothesize that alcohol associated gut dysbiosis will
be characterized by reductions in butyrate-producing species (Aim 1); that reductions in these species will
associate with increased levels of microbial translocation, inflammation, and harmful metabolites (Aim 2); and
that reductions in butyrate-producing species will associate with greater subclinical CVD dysfunction, CVD risk,
and mortality risk (Aim 3). Prior studies examining alcohol associated dysbiosis in PWH are limited in
two major ways: (1) they rely on 16S characterization of the gut microbiome, which cannot provide granular
(i.e., species level) data; or (2) they employ whole genome sequencing (WGS) to collect species level data, but
only in small samples. Our application is innovative because it addresses both limitations by utilizing WGS in
three existing, fully harmonized NIAAA-funded studies involving 583 PWH who consume alcohol with >1700
longitudinal fecal specimens. Extant data include alcohol measures (AUDIT; Timeline Followback, TLFB;
phosphatidyl ethanol, PEth), stored serum/plasma and fecal samples, 16S gut microbiome data, and serum
biomarkers for metabolites (e.g., TMAO), microbial translocation (e.g., LBP), inflammation (e.g., IL-6), VACS
Index (mortality) and Reynolds Risk (CVD) scores, and echocardiograms. New data to be generated are
WGS on all fecal samples from the three studies. Specific Aims are as follows: Aim 1: To characterize
alcohol associated dysbiosis using WGS, employing longitudinal fecal specimens. Aim 2: To test the relations
of the gut microbiome at species/strain-level with markers of microbial translocation, inflammation, and harmful
metabolites. Aim 3: To test the association of species/strain-level changes in butyrate-producing and other gut
bacteria with subclinical CVD markers, CVD risk, and mortality risk. IMPACT: Precision medicine approaches
utilizing gut microbiota profiles at the species level can be leveraged into novel interventions to mitigate
harmful downstream health effects of alcohol (i.e., inflammation, CVD, mortality risk) in PWH.","<AIDS Virus><Absolute ethanol><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Address><Alcohol Chemical Class><Alcohol Drinking><Alcohol consumption><Alcohols><Amines><Antibiotic Therapy><Antibiotic Treatment><Artifacts><B cell differentiation factor><B cell stimulating factor 2><B-Cell Differentiation Factor><B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2><B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2><BCDF><BSF-2><BSF2><Back><Bacteria><Bacterial Genes><Biological Markers><Blood Plasma><Blood Serum><Butyrates><Cancer Treatment><Cardiovascular Diseases><Cessation of life><Characteristics><Circulation><Cohort Studies><Concurrent Studies><Data><Death><Diet><Disease><Disease Marker><Disorder><Dorsum><Dysfunction><ETOH><Echocardiogram><Echocardiography><Ensure><Enterocytes><EtOH drinking><EtOH use><Ethanol><Ethyl Alcohol><Excess Mortality><Functional disorder><Funding><GI microbiome><GI microbiota><Gastrointestinal microbiota><Grain Alcohol><HIV><HIV Infections><HPGF><HTLV-III Infections><HTLV-III-LAV Infections><Health><Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections><Hybridoma Growth Factor><IFN-beta 2><IFNB2><IL-6><IL6 Protein><Inflammation><Interleukin-6><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Investigators><LAV-HTLV-III><LPS-binding protein><Left Ventricular Dysfunction><Link><Lipopolysaccharides><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><MGI-2><Malignant Neoplasm Therapy><Malignant Neoplasm Treatment><Measures><Methods><Methylcarbinol><Modeling><Morphologic artifacts><Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein><Myocardial depression><Myocardial dysfunction><NIAAA><NIH><National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism><National Institutes of Health><Observation research><Observation study><Observational Study><Observational research><Oxides><Participant><Pathogenicity><Persons><Physiopathology><Plasma><Plasma Serum><Plasmacytoma Growth Factor><Probiotics><Process><Public Health><Request for Proposals><Research Personnel><Research Specimen><Researchers><Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma><Risk><Sampling><Serum><Specimen><Technology><Testing><Transthoracic Echocardiography><United States National Institutes of Health><Vascular Diseases><Vascular Disorder><Virus-HIV><alcohol effect><alcohol ingestion><alcohol intake><alcohol product use><alcohol related research><alcohol research><alcohol use><alcohol use disorder><alcoholic beverage consumption><alcoholic drink intake><amine><anti-cancer therapy><bacteria in the gut><bacterial disease treatment><bacterial infectious disease treatment><bio-markers><biobehavior><biobehavioral><biologic marker><biomarker><blood vessel disorder><cancer therapy><cancer-directed therapy><cardiac dysfunction><cardiovascular disease risk><cardiovascular disorder><cardiovascular disorder risk><cardiovascular risk><cardiovascular risk factor><career><cohort><cost effective><data harmonization><death risk><demographics><design><designing><diets><digestive tract microbiome><dysbacteriosis><dysbiosis><dysbiotic><enteric microbial community><enteric microbiome><enteric microbiota><entire genome><ethanol consumption><ethanol drinking><ethanol effect><ethanol ingestion><ethanol intake><ethanol product use><ethanol research><ethanol use><ethanol use disorder><fecal sample><full genome><gastrointestinal microbial flora><gastrointestinal microbiome><genome sequencing><gut bacteria><gut commensal><gut community><gut dysbiosis><gut flora><gut microbe community><gut microbial community><gut microbial composition><gut microbial consortia><gut microbiome><gut microbiota><gut microbiotic><gut microflora><gut-associated microbiome><harmonized data><hazardous drinking><heart dysfunction><heart sonography><indexing><innovate><innovation><innovative><interferon beta 2><interventional strategy><intestinal biome><intestinal flora><intestinal microbiome><intestinal microbiota><intestinal microflora><intestinal tract microflora><left ventricle abnormality><lipopolysaccharide-binding protein><malleable risk><microbial><microbial imbalance><microbiome><microbiota patterns><microbiota profiles><microbiota signature><modifiable risk><mortality><mortality risk><novel><pathophysiology><personalized health intervention><personalized intervention><prebiotics><precision interventions><precision medicine><precision-based medicine><public health relevance><research study><response><stool sample><stool specimen><systemic inflammation><systemic inflammatory response><timeline><vascular dysfunction><vascular inflammation><vasculopathy><whole genome>","Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health; Biotechnology; Cardiovascular; Complementary and Integrative Health; Genetics; HIV/AIDS; Heart Disease; Human Genome; Infectious Diseases; Microbiome; Nutrition; Precision Medicine; Prevention; Substance Misuse"
Molecular recognition by ADAR1 of Z-RNA within transcriptomes,Molecular recognition by ADAR1 of Z-RNA within transcriptomes,"1 Project Summary
 2 RNA editing of cellular RNAs helps the cell distinguish between self and non-self RNAs. This
 3 editing of adenosines into inosines is generally catalyzed by the ‘adenosine deaminase acting on
 4 RNA-1’ protein (ADAR1). A>I editing is augmented in tumors and upon infection, primarily
 5 through the interferon-induced longer isoform of ADAR1 that comprises a Z-DNA/Z-RNA binding
 6 domain named ‘Zα’ at its N-terminus. Misediting is implicated in neurological diseases such as
 7 Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Z-RNA in the form of repeats of cytosine and guanosine (CpG) in a
 8 left-handed double-helical conformation has been proposed in cells, but the prevalence of such
 9 structures and their exact role are unknown. In addition, many —if not most— regions proposed
10 to adopt a Z conformation do not resemble regular (CpG)n. How these local Z-RNA conformations
11 are generated within A-form helices, stabilized and regulated by Zα of ADAR1, as well as their
12 exact role in the function of these RNAs, remain unknown. Our hypothesis is that the binding
13 of Zα to Z-RNA plays an essential role during the editing process. Here, we propose to
14 answer the following questions: What is the mechanism for Z-RNA formation at CpG but also
15 non-CpG sequences? How widespread are transitions to Z-RNA across transcriptomes? Is Z-
16 RNA sampled in the free form or only adopted upon binding by Zα? What are the structural
17 features of Z-RNA recognition by Zα at non CpG sequences? We will first dynamically
18 characterize the propensity of various sequence contexts to adopt Z-RNA conformations.
19 This aim will use advanced NMR methods to characterize the sequence of events that lead an
20 RNA region from A-form to Z-form. Second, we will determine the unbiased 3D structure of
21 RNA fragments bound to Zα in solution. Finally, we will identify and localize Zα binding
22 sites and Zα-dependent A>I editing events. This aim will take advantage of the robust
23 expertise and support for next-generation sequencing on our campus and at a contracted
24 company. Overall, our joint work as co-PIs will provide a structural rationale for the formation of
25 Z-RNA and the resulting formation of A-Z junctions across a variety of RNAs. We ultimately aim
26 to explain how the Z-RNA binding domain of ADAR1 increases the specificity and activity of
27 ADAR1. Our findings will help beyond this application with proposing a comprehensive
28 mechanism for ADAR1 editing and its RNA-mediated transcriptome-wide regulation, and
29 contribute to understanding disease such as cancer or auto-immune deficiencies.","<3-D structure><3-dimensional structure><3D structure><Address><Adenosine><Adenosine Aminohydrolase><Adopted><Adoption><Affect><Aicardi Goutieres syndrome><Alu Elements><Alu Family><Alu Repetitive Sequences><Autoimmune><Autoimmune Diseases><Base Sequence><Binding><Binding Sites><Biological Function><Biological Process><Biophysics><Brain Diseases><Brain Disorders><CREE ENCEPHALITIS><Cancers><Cell Body><Cells><Combining Site><Contracting Opportunities><Contracts><Cytoplasm><Cytosine><DNA Transposable Elements><Disease><Disorder><Encephalon Diseases><Encephalopathy with intracranial calcification and chronic lymphocytosis of cerebrospinal fluid><Encephalopathy, familial infantile, with calcification of basal ganglia and chronic cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis><Enzyme Gene><Enzymes><Event><Gene Action Regulation><Gene Expression Regulation><Gene Regulation><Gene Regulation Process><Geography><Goals><Guanosine><Human><IFN><Immune response><Immune system><Immunological response><Infection><Infectious Agent><Innate Immune Response><Inosine><Interferons><Intracranial CNS Disorders><Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders><Isoforms><Joints><Knowledge><Lead><Left><Left-Handed DNA><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Mediating><Methods><Modern Man><Molecular Configuration><Molecular Conformation><Molecular Interaction><Molecular Stereochemistry><NGS Method><NGS system><Names><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neurologic Disorders><Neurological Disorders><Non-Polyadenylated RNA><Nuclear><Nucleotide Sequence><Pb element><Play><Point Mutation><Population><Prevalence><Process><Protein Isoforms><Proteins><Publishing><Putative RNA-Binding Region><RNA><RNA Binding><RNA Binding Domain><RNA Conformation><RNA Editing><RNA Gene Products><RNA Recognition Motif><RNA Seq><RNA Viruses><RNA bound><RNA sequencing><RNA, Messenger, Editing><RNAseq><RNP Domain><RNP Motif><RNP-1 Signature><Reactive Site><Regulation><Ribonucleic Acid><Role><Sampling><Site><Specificity><Structure><Techniques><Transposable Elements><Work><Z-DNA><Z-Form DNA><adenosine deaminase><adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA><autoimmune condition><autoimmune disorder><autoimmunity disease><biophysical foundation><biophysical principles><biophysical sciences><cancer progression><conformation><conformational><conformational state><conformationally><conformations><dADAR><double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase><dsRNA adenosine deaminase><dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase><global gene expression><global transcription profile><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><host response><immune system response><immunoresponse><in vivo><infectious organism><malignancy><microcephaly-chorioretinopathy syndrome><molecular recognition><mutant><name><named><naming><neoplasm progression><neoplasm/cancer><neoplastic progression><neurological disease><next gen sequencing><next generation sequencing><nextgen sequencing><nucleic acid sequence><plasma protein Z><protein Z><pseudotoxoplasmosis syndrome><response><restraint><social role><three dimensional structure><transcriptome><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing><tumor><tumor progression><zDNA>",Genetics
Iron-CLAD: securely advancing AoU participant characterization with proven platforms and collaborations,Iron-CLAD: securely advancing AoU participant characterization with proven platforms and collaborations,"Precision medicine aims to accurately classify patients to improve diagnosis, intervention selection, and prognosis. The All of Us Research Program (AoURP) collects an array of data types from participants, including surveys, electronic health records (EHRs), physical measurements, wearable devices, and biosamples, offering valuable insights into health trajectories. However, certain aspects of a participant’s life remain missing in the collected data, which can limit the accuracy of research and care. To address this gap, we propose the creation of the All of Us Center for Linkage and Acquisition of Data (CLAD) to supplement existing data sources using passive data streams and deploy integration strategies to ""put the patient back together again"" and more deeply assess health outcomes. This team brings together collective experience leading large initiatives involving data acquisition, linkage, harmonization, quality assurance, pipelines and platforms, governance, and security. We will design and implement a data collection, linkage, and integration strategy that lays a foundation for a variety of AoURP data linkages for identified, and de-identified data integration, including person-level linkages such as with mortality, residential history, and administrative claims, and geocoded data pipelines to enable linkages with environmental and economic data. The CLAD will acquire and process new data linkages and geocoded data in a cloud-based Data Linkage Platform (DLP), guided by our experience formulating researcher-ready datasets with scientific utility. Our CLAD team will perform data quality assurance, repair, and standardization checks to ensure accuracy and robustness of data-driven research. This endeavor will align data with interoperability standards and clinical terminologies, extend them where necessary, and create a data quality dashboard for every data change and data health check. We will also explore new methods of clinical data acquisition to mitigate data missingness by comparing data provided from recruitment sites with EHR data from Health Information Networks. CLAD data sources and novel analytical methods, such as probabilistic models, will be used to reveal patterns of care, health outcomes, and potential interventions for common, chronic, and genetic diseases.",<Address><Affect><African American group><African American individual><African American people><African American population><African Americans><All of Us Program><All of Us Research Program><All of Us Research Project><AoURP><Apoplexy><Back><Bayesian Modeling><Bayesian adaptive designs><Bayesian adaptive models><Bayesian belief network><Bayesian belief updating model><Bayesian framework><Bayesian hierarchical model><Bayesian network model><Bayesian nonparametric models><Bayesian spatial data model><Bayesian spatial image models><Bayesian spatial models><Bayesian statistical models><Bayesian tracking algorithms><Biomedical Research><Brain Vascular Accident><Cancers><Cardiac Diseases><Cardiac Disorders><Caring><Cerebral Stroke><Cerebrovascular Apoplexy><Cerebrovascular Stroke><Classification><Clinical><Clinical Data><Collaborations><Communicable Diseases><Data><Data Collection><Data Linkages><Data Set><Data Sources><Diabetes Mellitus><Diagnosis><Disclosure><Dorsum><Electronic Health Record><Enhancement Technology><Ensure><Environmental Factor><Environmental Risk Factor><Expert Opinion><Fe element><Federally Qualified Health Center><Foundations><General Population><General Public><Genes><Genetic><Genomics><Goals><Health><Health system><Heart Diseases><Hispanic Populations><Hispanic group><Hispanic individual><Hispanic people><Hispanics><History><Individual><Infectious Disease Pathway><Infectious Diseases><Infectious Disorder><Information Disclosure><Ingestion><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Investigators><Iron><Life><Link><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Measurement><Medicaid><Methods><Modeling><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Opiate Addiction><Opiate Dependence><Outcome><Participant><Patients><Patterns of Care><Persons><Phenotype><Preventative strategy><Prevention strategy><Preventive strategy><Privacy><Probabilistic Models><Probability Models><Process><Prognosis><Recontacts><Record Linkage Study><Recording of previous events><Reporting><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Risk><Risk Assessment><Secure><Security><Site><Source><Standardization><Statistical Models><Stroke><Survey Instrument><Surveys><Systematics><Terminology><Underrepresented Groups><Underrepresented Populations><Underserved Population><Uninsured><United States National Institutes of Health><Variant><Variation><analytical method><brain attack><cerebral vascular accident><cerebrovascular accident><cloud based><community intervention><community level intervention><community-based intervention><dashboard><data acquisition><data acquisitions><data de-identification><data deidentification><data integration><data pipeline><data quality><data streams><de-identified data><deidentified data><design><designing><diabetes><electronic health care record><electronic health medical record><electronic health plan record><electronic health registry><electronic medical health record><environmental justice><environmental risk><experience><health data><heart disorder><histories><improved><indexing><ingest><insight><interoperability><interventional strategy><malignancy><mortality><neoplasm/cancer><novel><opioid addiction><opioid dependence><opioid dependent><patient stratification><precision medicine><precision-based medicine><privacy preservation><quality assurance><remediation><repair><repaired><sexual minority><social factors><statistical linear mixed models><statistical linear models><stratified patient><stroked><strokes><tool><treatment strategy><under representation of groups><under represented groups><under represented people><under represented populations><under served group><under served individual><under served people><under served population><underrepresentation of groups><underrepresented people><underserved group><underserved individual><underserved people><wearable><wearable device><wearable electronics><wearable system><wearable technology><wearable tool><wearables>,Data Science; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Patient Safety; Precision Medicine; Social Determinants of Health
"Interleukin-6 signaling, lung injury, and post-TB lung disease in TB-HIV","Interleukin-6 signaling, lung injury, and post-TB lung disease in TB-HIV","ABSTRACT
Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading infectious killers worldwide with over 10 million new cases and 1.5 million
deaths each year. Pulmonary TB, the most common form of the disease, is associated with lung injury that can
persist beyond treatment completion. Post-TB lung disease (PTLD) is an important contributor to excess
disability and mortality that can affect an estimated 155 million TB survivors globally. Yet there are no known
interventions to prevent TB-associated lung injury and the likelihood of subsequent PTLD. The goal of this R01
proposal is to characterize the burden, severity, and phenotypic presentation of PTLD, and its association with
interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling pathways, in TB patients with and without HIV. We will leverage the ongoing NIH
and Indian Government funded RePORT-India TB Research Consortium, a multi-site study that is prospectively
evaluating HIV-uninfected adults with drug-sensitive TB for lung injury during and after TB treatment, by enrolling
a comparison cohort of HIV-positive drug-sensitive TB patients matched on age, sex, and smoking exposure
who will follow identical study protocols. Through Aim-1, we will extensively characterize and compare the
phenotypic differences in lung injury at TB treatment initiation, its resolution during treatment, and subsequent
PTLD between TB patients with versus without HIV using a multi-dimensional approach of pulmonary function
testing, respiratory health and functional status assessments, and novel lung imaging approaches. Through Aim-
2, we will use induced sputum samples to comprehensively investigate the role of different IL-6 signaling
pathways in determining the extent of lung injury, and its resolution during TB treatment, by measuring key
immune, cellular, and gene expression markers, along with downstream inflammatory pathways linked to acute
lung injury and fibrotic remodeling. This R01 application will expand upon our prior and ongoing research in India
and generate evidence to support the design of clinical trials of host-directed therapies for selectively modulating
IL-6 signaling pathways to improve pulmonary outcomes in TB patients with and without HIV.","<(TNF)-α><21+ years old><ADAM-17><AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired

An implementation science approach to the design and evaluation of tuberculosis self-testing in Peru,An implementation science approach to the design and evaluation of tuberculosis self-testing in Peru,"Project Summary
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health emergency, responsible for 10 million new cases in 2021. Despite the
global community's extensive effort to identify TB cases, 30% of the new cases were never diagnosed. Current
efforts focus on active case finding of TB which is expensive and difficult to implement in practice. One approach
that can address the challenges is self-testing. Self-testing for TB has not been widely implemented to date, due
in part to a lack of appropriate testing modalities and studies evaluating this approach. However, recent advances
in diagnostic tools make self-testing a realistic possibility, opening a new door for patient-centered TB care.
I propose a type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness study to evaluate the feasibility of implementing self-
testing for active TB. I will apply a currently available diagnostic tool – oral swab specimens for Xpert Ultra (which
are easy to self-collect and highly sensitive but require shipping to a laboratory). I will first identify barriers to the
implementation of TB self-testing and refine the implementation strategies to address these barriers by using
qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys (Aim 1). I will then perform a prospective study in six high-risk
occupational settings in South Africa, where working-age individuals are known to rarely seek care, placing oral
swab kits in three interventional sites and maintaining the standard of care in three control sites (Aim 2). I will
evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of each strategy guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adopt,
Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. My primary outcome will be an increase in the
proportion of individuals receiving microbiological testing results, reflecting the acceptability and fidelity of TB
self-testing. To achieve the aims, I will use a highly pragmatic study design in which the study team minimizes
contact with the study sites. This will enable me to evaluate whether the implementation of TB self-testing is
likely to impact case finding and improve working-aged individuals’ health outcomes in a “real world” setting.
Completion of this study will generate pragmatic, preliminary data on the potential implementation and
effectiveness of TB self-testing in high-burden settings, which if successful will justify a larger trial and if not will
inform alternative approaches to overcoming barriers to seeking care for TB. In either case, these findings will
motivate a larger R01 proposal at the end of the five-year grant period and advance the field of TB self-testing.
While this proposal will evaluate self-testing using an available tool, a broader goal is to conceptualize the self-
testing strategy in TB disease that will be applicable to future tools, thus representing a step toward improving
patient-initiated or patient-centered TB care. The study will also serve as a vehicle for me to acquire skills in
mixed methods study and implementation science, positioning me as a future leader in implementing patient-
centered TB interventions in the global health context.

Regulation of HSP70 function during heat stress tolerance,Regulation of HSP70 function during heat stress tolerance,"Project Summary
 The 70-kilodalton heat shock protein (HSP70) family, universally conserved across prokaryotic and
eukaryotic organisms, serves as essential molecular chaperones for maintaining protein homeostasis. They are
central to the pathology of various diseases, including cancer, infectious diseases, neurodegeneration, and
cardiovascular disorders. Beyond their established intracellular roles, HSP70 proteins also manifest in the
extracellular space, significantly influencing cancer biology by modulating immune responses and facilitating
metastasis. This positions them as vital biomarkers for deciphering and potentially targeting the mechanisms
underlying cancer pathology. The critical involvement of HSP70 in such diverse human pathologies underscores
the potential of therapeutic strategies to modulate HSP70 pathways. Delving into the complex structure-function
relationship of HSP70 is essential for developing novel therapeutic interventions capable of addressing various
pathologies. This project aims to elucidate the intricate roles of the cytosolic HSP70, with a particular emphasis
on its underexplored structural attributes and their ramifications for cellular operations and disease pathogenesis.
The long-term objectives include a deeper understanding of HSP70’s role in maintaining cellular integrity and
stress response, which is crucial for developing innovative therapeutic interventions for various diseases.
Specifically, the research will concentrate on HSP70’s lectin-like capacity to bind O-GlcNAcylated proteins, its
ability to bind calcium/calmodulin, and its extracellular functions. These functionalities are hypothesized to be
pivotal in modulating cellular thermoresistance and stress responses and potentially influencing the onset and
progression of various diseases. The chosen model system for this investigation is Arabidopsis cytosolic HSP70
(AtHSP70), selected for its significant homology to human HSP70 isoforms and its established role in conferring
heat stress resilience in plants. This model provides a robust framework for dissecting the conserved
mechanisms of HSP70 function relevant to human health, thus directly aligning with the mission of improving the
understanding and treatment of human diseases. To achieve these aims, the project will employ cutting-edge
techniques such as proximity labeling with TurboID to identify novel protein interactions in vivo and lectin weak
affinity chromatography to characterize the interaction between HSP70 and glycosylated proteins. Through a
detailed examination of these interactions, the project seeks to expand the current understanding of HSP70’s
intracellular and extracellular functions and uncover potential therapeutic targets within the HSP70 pathway. By
revealing how alterations in HSP70’s interactions with carbohydrates and Ca2+/CaM can influence disease
mechanisms, the research aims to open new avenues for developing therapies that modulate these pathways.
In essence, this project embodies a strategic approach to bridging fundamental biological research with potential
clinical applications, thereby underscoring its relevance to the overarching goal of advancing human health by
targeting the molecular bases of disease.",<4 Hydroxyproline><70-kD Heat-Shock Protein><ATP phosphohydrolase><ATPase><Address><Adenosine Triphosphatase><Affinity Chromatography><Animals><Arabidopsis><Binding><Biologic Models><Biological Markers><Biological Models><Breast Cancer Cell><Calcium><Calcium Binding><Calcium-Dependent Activator Protein><Calcium-Dependent Regulator><Calmodulin><Cancer Biology><Cancers><Carbohydrates><Cardiovascular Diseases><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Signaling><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Cellular Stress><Cellular Stress Response><Chaperone><Characteristics><Client><Communicable Diseases><Complex><Coupled><Cytoplasm><Defense Mechanisms><Development><Disease><Disease Pathway><Disorder><Effectiveness><Exhibits><Extracellular Space><Family><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic defect><Goals><HSP 70><HSP70><Health><Heat Stress><Heat shock proteins><Heat-Shock Proteins 70><Human><Human Pathology><Hydroxyproline><Immune response><Immunological response><Immunomodulation><Infectious Disease Pathway><Infectious Diseases><Infectious Disorder><Intercellular Space><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigation><Isoforms><Label><Lectin><Life><Life Cycle><Life Cycle Stages><Link><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Mammalia><Mammals><Mediating><Metabolic Glycosylation><Metabolic Pathway><Metastasis><Metastasize><Metastatic Lesion><Metastatic Mass><Metastatic Neoplasm><Metastatic Tumor><Methods><Missense Mutation><Mission><Model System><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular Chaperones><Molecular Interaction><Molecular Target><Mutation><Nature><Neoplasm Metastasis><Nerve Degeneration><Neuron Degeneration><Nucleotides><Nutritional><Organism><Oxyproline><Pathogenesis><Pathology><Pathway interactions><Peptides><Phosphodiesterase Activating Factor><Phosphodiesterase Protein Activator><Physiologic><Physiological><Plants><Play><Position><Positioning Attribute><Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry><Post-Translational Modifications><Post-Translational Protein Modification><Post-Translational Protein Processing><Posttranslational Modifications><Posttranslational Protein Processing><Property><Protein Glycosylation><Protein Isoforms><Protein Modification><Proteins><Reader><Recombinants><Regulation><Research><Role><Secondary Neoplasm><Secondary Tumor><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Specificity><Stress><Structure-Activity Relationship><Subcellular Process><System><Techniques><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Intervention><affinity purification><analog><angiogenesis><base><bases><bio-markers><biologic marker><biological adaptation to stress><biological research><biological signal transduction><biomarker><breast tumor cell><calcium bound><cancer metastasis><cardiovascular disorder><cell stress><chemical structure function><clinical applicability><clinical application><develop therapy><developmental><extracellular><genome mutation><glycosylation><host response><hsp70 Family><human disease><immune modulation><immune regulation><immune system response><immunologic reactivity control><immunomodulatory><immunoregulation><immunoregulatory><immunoresponse><improved><in vivo><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><interest><intervention development><intervention therapy><life course><living system><malignancy><neoplasm/cancer><neural degeneration><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neurological degeneration><neuronal degeneration><new therapeutic approach><new therapeutic intervention><new therapeutic strategies><new therapy approaches><new treatment approach><new treatment strategy><novel><novel therapeutic approach><novel therapeutic intervention><novel therapeutic strategies><novel therapy approach><nutritious><operation><operations><pathway><protein folding><protein homeostasis><proteostasis><psychological defense mechanism><reaction; crisis><resilience><resilient><resilient to stress><response><social role><stress protein><stress resilience><stress resiliency><stress response><stress tolerance><stress; reaction><structure function relationship><therapeutic target><therapy development><treatment development><tumor cell metastasis>,Building Research Capacity at Institutions with Limited NIH Funding; Cancer; Climate-Related Exposures and Conditions
Regulation of Neurodegeneration by Nonpathogenic Cellular Prion Protein and LRP1,Regulation of Neurodegeneration by Nonpathogenic Cellular Prion Protein and LRP1,"Microglial activation and neuro-inflammation regulate disease progression in diverse neurodegenerative di-
seases (NDs), including but not limited to Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Tauopathies. Under-
standing pathways that regulate neuro-inflammation in NDs is a significant goal. Cellular Prion Protein (PrPC) is
best known as a GPI-anchored membrane protein that, in rare circumstances, undergoes conformational change
to generate a derivative that aggregates in the brain, causing rapid ND and death. Pathogenic PrPC is trans-
missible. Non-pathogenic PrPC is expressed widely, inside and outside the CNS. Numerous studies in diverse
mouse model systems have shown that PrPC attenuates inflammatory responses, including neuro-inflammation.
We contributed to this field by identifying a system of receptors that mediates the anti-inflammatory activity of
PrPC in macrophages when PrPC is released from cells by ADAM family proteases (S-PrP) or in exosomes and
other extracellular vesicles (EVs). This receptor system includes LDL Receptor-related Protein-1 (LRP1) and
the NMDA Receptor (NMDA-R). Binding of PrPC derivatives to the LRP1/NMDA-R receptor assembly in mac-
rophages blocks pro-inflammatory responses initiated by diverse Pattern Recognition Receptors. We now have
data showing that the PrPC-LRP1/NMDA-R interaction initiates anti-inflammatory cell-signaling in microglia. We
also have shown that the anti-inflammatory activity of S-PrP may be harnessed in small synthetic peptides (14-
mers, 4-mer) corresponding to a putative LRP1-binding motif in PrPC that includes Lys100 and Lys103. The major
goal of this research project is to characterize the activity of PrPC and the LRP1/NMDA-R receptor system in
neuro-inflammation in NDs. A second goal is to test whether PrPC derivatives may be administered therapeu-
tically to amplify the activity of the microglial LRP1/NMDA-R system and thereby attenuate neuro-inflammation.
Three specific aims are proposed. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the ability of anti-inflammatory PrPC derivatives
to regulate microglial activation and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators by microglia and astrocytes in res-
ponse to proteins that accumulate and aggregate in the extracellular spaces of the CNS in various NDs, including
amyloid-β (Aβ), microtubule-associated protein Tau, and α-synuclein. In Specific Aim 2, the effects of PrPC gene
(Prnp) deletion on biomarkers of microglial activation and neuro-inflammation will be studied in three distinct
mouse models of ND, including AppNL-F mice, P301S-Tau transgenic mice, and mice that receive intracerebral
injections of α-synuclein pre-formed fibrils. In Specific Aim 3, we will replicate the studies proposed in Specific
Aim 2, studying tga20 mice, which express 3-4× more PrPC in the CNS compared with wild-type mice. Next, we
will exploit the known ability of LRP1 to serve as a Blood-Brain Barrier Trojan Horse-receptor that transports
proteins into the CNS and test whether systemically administered PrPC-derived proteins and peptides augment
the anti-inflammatory activity of the microglial LRP1/NMDA-R receptor system in the CNS. Collectively, these
studies will elucidate a novel anti-inflammatory system that may be highly significant in diverse NDs.",<AD dementia><Address><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer beta-Protein><Alzheimer disease

The role of a Coxiella burnetii effector protein that inhibits RIG-I signaling,The role of a Coxiella burnetii effector protein that inhibits RIG-I signaling,"Project Summary/Abstract
Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen that grows within a lysosome-derived vacuole.
The formation of a replication-permissive vacuole by C. burnetii requires a type IVB secretion system called
Dot/Icm, and the >130 effector proteins delivered by this system into the host cell. While it is established that
the collective activities of these effector proteins remodel host signaling networks to create a replication-
permissive environment, the molecular targets and biochemical mechanisms of most of these effectors are not
known. My studies have established that C. burnetii inhibits the activation of the host RIG-I pathway, a
cytosolic double-stranded RNA sensing pathway, and that this process requires two effectors, EmcA and
EmcB. Although these proteins do not have predicted sequence or structural homology that would indicate
possible biochemical functions, we established that EmcB has cysteine deubiquitinase activity. EmcB directly
targets RIG-I and preferentially cleaves long, K63-linked ubiquitin chains that are potent activators of RIG-I
signaling. The goal of this study is to determine how EmcB functions to cleave ubiquitin chains from RIG-I
during infection and identify how C. burnetii infection is sensed by RIG-I. To achieve this goal, I will use
biochemical assays, pull-down experiments, and infection studies using a newly engineered emcA, emcB
double mutant to determine how EmcB functions to inhibit the RIG-I pathway during infection (Aim 1). Next, I
will identify the specific RNAs sensed by RIG-I during C. burnetii infection and test the relative capacity of
these RNAs to activate the RIG-I pathway (Aim 2). Together, these studies will enhance our understanding of
how intracellular bacterial pathogens modulate host signaling networks for productive infection. By
understanding the molecular details of how an intracellular pathogen modulates host processes, fundamental
details of C. burnetii infection will be uncovered which could provide insights that lead to improved treatments.

"Utility of human milk oligosaccharides against the perinatal pathogen, Group B Streptococcus","Utility of human milk oligosaccharides against the perinatal pathogen, Group B Streptococcus","Project Summary
Adverse pregnancy outcomes are a global issue that affects more than 50 million people per year. Infections
during gestation contribute significantly to adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth and neonatal
sepsis. Streptococcus agalactiae or Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of ascending vaginal and
intrauterine infection during pregnancy. To initiate infection, GBS must colonize the vagina and initiate a robust
biofilm to turn the vaginal mucosa into a replicative niche. Subsequently, GBS ascends the reproductive tract in
an undefined process to invade the gestational membranes, cross the placenta, and infect the amniotic cavity
and the fetus. Currently, there is no commercially available vaccine against GBS to prevent its cognate disease
outcomes. However, epidemiological data has indicated that exposure to maternal breast milk is associated with
protection against GBS infection of the neonate. We have new and exciting data to suggest that components of
human breast milk, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), have antibiofilm activity against GBS. Given
this, we hypothesize that treatment with HMOs could lead to decreased GBS biofilm formation, colonization,
invasive infection cognate inflammation, microbiome disruption, and disease progression. We will test this by
determining the contribution of HMOs on bacterial and immunological responses in primary human placental
macrophages, an organ-on-a-chip infection model, ex vivo gestational membrane model, vaginal tissue models
and a mouse model of infection during pregnancy. This work will help us establish the efficacy of deployment of
prebiotic HMOs as a cost-effective dietary or chemotherapeutic strategy against GBS which may improve
pregnancy outcomes in vulnerable groups.",<Active Oxygen><Adherence><Affect><Amnionitides><Anti-Bacterial Agents><Antibiotic Agents><Antibiotic Drugs><Antibiotic Therapy><Antibiotic

Impact of benzalkonium chloride on gut microbiome and gut-liver interactions,Impact of benzalkonium chloride on gut microbiome and gut-liver interactions,"Benzalkonium chlorides (BACs) are widely used antimicrobials in disinfecting products, medical products, and
food processing industries, suggesting humans may be exposed chronically to BACs through various routes.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to greatly increased use of disinfectants, resulting in a 174% increase
in median BAC levels in human blood. We recently analyzed 15 de-identified human fecal samples collected
during COVID-19 and detected BACs in all of them, ranging from 55 nM to 2.74 µM (a 50-fold difference). BACs
are potent antimicrobials, but their effect on the gut microbiome has not been examined, which is the major gap
that this proposal aims to fill. Our goal is to characterize the effect of BAC exposure on gut microbiome compo-
sition and function, microbiota metabolism, and altered liver metabolism via the gut-liver axis. We previously
reported that BACs are metabolized by human cytochromes P450 (CYP) in the liver. Our preliminary data sup-
port biliary excretion from the liver to the intestine being the major route of elimination for BACs. Thus, exposure
of gut microbiome to BACs is inevitable regardless of the route of exposure. Disruption of the gut microbiome
can lead to changes in endogenous and xenobiotic metabolism through modulating the ligand availability for the
bile acid-sensing farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the lipid-sensing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha
(PPARa), and xenobiotic-sensing constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR). Im-
portantly, in a preliminary study, we found that BAC exposure in mice significantly upregulated the expression of
Cyp2c38, Cyp2j6, Cyp4a10, and Cyp4f13 in the liver, which is consistent with the inhibition of CAR and/or acti-
vation of PPARa. Thus, we hypothesize that BACs reduce gut microbiome diversity and alter the metabolism of
xenobiotics, bile acids, sterols, and lipids in the liver by modulating the activities of nuclear receptors. In Aim 1,
we will characterize the impact of BAC exposure at different doses and exposure regimes on gut microbiome
diversity and function in mice. We will then correlate the changes in microbiome functional genes with the
changes in the gut bile acid, sterol, and lipid profiles. In Aim 2, we will measure the effect of BAC exposure on
bile acid, sterol, lipid, and xenobiotic metabolism in the liver of conventional and germ-free mice. Relationships
between bile acid, sterol, and lipid profiles and relevant gene expression levels in the liver will be evaluated.
Activation or inhibition of nuclear receptors regulating xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) will be as-
sessed. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the relationship between BAC levels and gut microbiome diversity and function
in humans. The significance of this project lies in that it will allow us to begin to understand the impact of in-
creased BAC exposure on gut microbiome and gut-liver interactions in humans. The innovation of this project
lies in that a) it represents the first study to examine the impact of BAC exposure on gut-liver interactions, and
b) alteration of XME gene expression by BAC exposure represents a novel gene-environment interaction that
could affect the metabolism of endogenous metabolites and other xenobiotics.","<Affect><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Antiseptics><Bacteria><Benzalkonium Chloride><Bile Acids><Biliary><Biological><Blood><Blood Plasma><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Blood Sample><Blood specimen><COVID crisis><COVID epidemic><COVID pandemic><COVID-19><COVID-19 crisis><COVID-19 epidemic><COVID-19 era><COVID-19 global health crisis><COVID-19 global pandemic><COVID-19 health crisis><COVID-19 pandemic><COVID-19 period><COVID-19 public health crisis><COVID-19 years><CPD6><CV-19><CYP 2D6><CYP2D><CYP2D6><CYP2D6 gene><CYP2DL1><CYPIID6><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Chronic><Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019><Cytochrome P-450><Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6><Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System><Cytochrome P450><Cytochrome P450 2D6><Cytochrome P450 Family Gene><Cytochrome P450 Subfamily IID Polypeptide 6><Data><Debrisoquine 4-Hydroxylase><Debrisoquine 4-Monooxygenase><Debrisoquine Hydroxylase><Detection><Disinfectants><Dose><Environmental Pollutants><Enzyme Gene><Enzymes><Excretory function><Exposure to><Feces><Food processing industry><Foundations><Frequencies><Future><GI microbiome><Gene Expression><Gene x Environment Interaction><Genes><Germ-Free><Goals><GxE interaction><Health><Hepatic Disorder><Human><Imipramine 2-Hydroxylase><Individual><Intermediary Metabolism><Intestinal><Intestines><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Isoforms><Knowledge><Ligands><Lipids><Liver><Liver Microsomes><Liver diseases><Local Anti-Infective Agents><Measures><Medical><Metabolic><Metabolic Diseases><Metabolic Disorder><Metabolic Pathway><Metabolic Processes><Metabolism><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Murine><Mus><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Nuclear Receptors><Oral><Outcome><P450><P450-2D6><P450-DB1><P450C2D><P450DB1><PPAR alpha><PPAR-α><PPARalpha><PPARα><PXR receptor><Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor alpha><Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor α><Plasma><Plasma Serum><Population><Prevention><Protein Isoforms><RNA Seq><RNA sequencing><RNAseq><Receptor Protein><Receptor Signaling><Reporting><Research><Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma><Risk><Role><Route><SARS-CoV-2 epidemic><SARS-CoV-2 global health crisis><SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic><SARS-CoV-2 pandemic><SARS-coronavirus-2 epidemic><SARS-coronavirus-2 pandemic><Safety><Sampling><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 epidemic><Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 pandemic><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic><Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic><Shotguns><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Sparteine Monooxygenase><Sterols><Subfamily IID Cytochrome P450><Subfamily IID-Like 1 Cytochrome P450><Thesaurismosis><Topical Anti-Infective Agents><United States National Institutes of Health><Xenobiotic Metabolism><Xenobiotics><anti-microbial><antimicrobial><bile acid metabolism><bile metabolism><biologic><biological signal transduction><bowel><constitutive androstane receptor><consumer product><coronavirus disease 2019><coronavirus disease 2019 crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic><coronavirus disease 2019 global health crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 global pandemic><coronavirus disease 2019 health crisis><coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic><coronavirus disease 2019 public health crisis><coronavirus disease crisis><coronavirus disease epidemic><coronavirus disease pandemic><coronavirus disease-19><coronavirus disease-19 global pandemic><coronavirus disease-19 pandemic><coronavirus infectious disease-19><digestive tract microbiome><enteric microbiome><environment effect on gene><environmental contaminant><excretion><exposure route><fat metabolism><fecal microbiome><fecal sample><gastrointestinal microbiome><gene environment interaction><gut microbiome><gut-associated microbiome><gut-liver axis><hepatic body system><hepatic disease><hepatic metabolism><hepatic organ system><hepatopathy><human disease><innovate><innovation><innovative><intestinal biome><intestinal microbiome><lipid metabolism><lipidomics><liver disorder><liver function><liver metabolism><metabolism disorder><metabolome><metabonome><metagenome sequencing><metagenomic sequencing><meter><microbial><microbial consortia><microbial flora><microbiome><microbiome community composition><microbiome composition><microbiome species composition><microbiome structure><microbiota><microflora><model of animal><multispecies consortia><novel><pandemic><pandemic disease><pre-pandemic><pregnane X receptor><receptor><response><severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global health crisis><severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic><shot gun><social role><stool><stool microbiome><stool sample><stool specimen><stool-associated microbiome><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing>",Clinical Research; Digestive Diseases; Liver Disease; Microbiome
A Novel Peptide for the Oral Treatment and Prevention of P. Gingivalis Infection,A Novel Peptide for the Oral Treatment and Prevention of P. Gingivalis Infection,"Project Summary
Our goal is to develop a first-in-class oral peptide inhibitor for the treatment and prevention of gingivitis and
periodontitis. Oral infection by P. gingivalis leads to inflammation and bleeding of the gums, called gingivitis,
and eventually bone and tooth loss, called periodontitis3. Almost 50% of adults worldwide over the age of thirty
have periodontal disease, making it one of the most common infections in humans11, 72. P. gingivalis infection is
also closely associated with several other chronic health conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease,
cardiovascular disease, cancer, and arthritis9, 12-16, 27.
P. gingivalis is considered a causative species in periodontitis that can function to shape the overall microbial
community leading to dysbiosis and tissue damage4-7. Clinical research has confirmed that initial P. gingivalis
colonization occurs outside the subgingival pocket38-40. P. gingivalis adheres efficiently to supragingival
bacteria such as commensal streptococci32-34. This adherence modulates the pathogenic potential of P.
gingivalis and drives colonization35-37. Thus, inhibiting the adherence of P. gingivalis to supragingival bacteria
represents an excellent approach to reducing and preventing periodontitis.
Our project team originally discovered that initial colonization of the oral cavity by P. gingivalis is mediated by
the minor fimbrial antigen Mfa1 of P. gingivalis binding to the surface antigen SspB of Streptococcus gordonii32,
42-44. Subsequently, we identified a domain in SspB essential to this binding45, 46. A synthetic peptide derived
from this region functions as a potent inhibitor of P. gingivalis adherence and formation of biofilms45, 46. In
addition, the synthetic peptide demonstrates inhibition of P. gingivalis virulence by preventing colonization and
subsequent alveolar bone loss in mouse models of severe periodontitis35.
Building from this innovative work, our objective is to advance this first-in-class, cyclic peptide (called VTC-880)
towards the clinic for the treatment and prevention of gingivitis and periodontitis. The key aims of this proposal
are to: 1) manufacture VTC-880 and establish potency and analytical assays, 2) determine the optimal
formulation and in vitro PK of VTC-880 in human saliva, 3) establish the oral PK and optimal effective dose
for VTC-880 in mice, 4) generate acute toxicology profiles for VTC-880 in mice and in a human saliva biofilm
model, and 5) finalize our IND-enabling and clinical study plan to advance VTC-880 into a clinical study.",<21+ years old><AD dementia><Acute><Adherence><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><Affinity><Age><Alveolar Bone Loss><Alveolar Resorption><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><Amino Acids><Antibiotic Agents><Antibiotic Drugs><Antibiotics><Antigens><Antiseptics><Arthritis><Assay><Bacteria><Bacteroides gingivalis><Binding><Bioassay><Biochemistry><Biological><Biological Assay><Biological Chemistry><Bleeding><Body Tissues><Buccal Cavity><Buccal Cavity Head and Neck><Cancers><Cardiovascular Diseases><Cavitas Oris><Cell Surface Antigens><Chronic><Chronic Periodontitis><Clinic><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Consumption><Cyclic Peptides><Cyclicity><Data><Dental><Dental Calculus><Dental Care><Dental Procedure><Detection><Development><Dose><Drug Kinetics><ELISA><Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay><Formulation><Gingivitis><Goals><Health><Hematology><Hemorrhage><Histopathology><Home><Human><Human Microbiome><Immunologic Surface Markers><Immunological Surface Markers><In Vitro><Incubated><Infection><Inflammation><Investments><LC/MS><Liquid substance><Local Anti-Infective Agents><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Marketing><Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis><Mass Spectrometry><Mass Spectroscopy><Mass Spectrum><Mass Spectrum Analyses><Mass Spectrum Analysis><Measurement><Measures><Mediating><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Microbial Biofilms><Minor><Miscellaneous Antibiotic><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular Interaction><Mouth><Mouth Sore><Mouth microbiome><Mouthwash><Murine><Mus><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Oral><Oral Administration><Oral Drug Administration><Oral cavity><Organ><P gingivalis><P. gingivalis><Parodontosis><Pathogenicity><Peptides><Performance><Periodicity><Periodontal Bone Loss><Periodontal Diseases><Periodontal Resorption><Periodontitis><Pharmacokinetics><Phase><Population><Porphyromonas gingivalis><Pre IND FDA meeting><Pre-IND mtg><Prevention><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Procedures><Recommendation><Recurrence><Recurrent><Rhythmicity><Ribosomal RNA><S gordonii><S. gordonii><SBIR><Saliva><Sampling><Shapes><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Solubility><Staining method><Stains><Streptococcus><Streptococcus gordonii><Surface Antigens><Surface Plasmon Resonance><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><Tartar><Time><Tissues><Tooth><Tooth Loss><Tooth structure><Topical Anti-Infective Agents><Toxicology><Virulence><Work><World Health><adulthood><ages><alleviate symptom><ameliorating symptom><aminoacid><aqueous><arthritic><bacteria pathogen><bacterial pathogen><biofilm><biologic><blood loss><bone loss><cardiovascular disorder><community microbes><decrease symptom><dental service><developmental><dysbacteriosis><dysbiosis><dysbiotic><enzyme linked immunoassay><fewer symptoms><first in man><first-in-human><fluid><homes><human-associated microbiome><immunogen><improved><infection mouth><inhibitor><innovate><innovation><innovative><intraoral drug delivery><irritation><liquid><liquid chromatography mass spectrometry><malignancy><manufacture><microbial community><microbial imbalance><microbiome><mouse model><murine model><neoplasm/cancer><novel><oral infection><oral infectious><oral microbial community><oral microbiome><oral microbiota><oral microflora><pathogenic bacteria><periodontal disorder><periodontium disease><periodontium disorder><polymicrobial community><pre-IND consultation><pre-IND discussion><pre-IND meeting><pre-Investigational New Drug meeting><preservation><prevent><preventing><primary degenerative dementia><procedural costs><procedure cost><rRNA><reduce symptoms><relieves symptoms><safety assessment><saliva sample><salivary sample><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><side effect><success><surgery><symptom alleviation><symptom reduction><symptom relief><synthetic peptide><teeth><treatment planning>,"Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Disease; Infectious Diseases; Microbiome; Prevention"
ISES 2024 Annual Meeting,ISES 2024 Annual Meeting,"Abstract
The International Society of Exposure Science (ISES) is the premier international society devoted to bringing
the full value of exposure science to research and decision-making to improve human health and the
environment. This conference represents the most comprehensive gathering of environmental exposure
scientists and environmental health professionals from academia, government, and organizations from
around the world, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the field. The theme of the 34th ISES Annual
Meeting is “Exposures that Impact Health in Vulnerable Populations”. The 2024 conference will focus
on new and emerging environmental health challenges for humans and the ecosystem. Environmental
exposures may affect human health and the ecosystem in complex and non-linear ways. Exposure and
health issues also vary between local, regional, and global scales. Understanding the complex nature of
environmental exposures, the health impacts, and relevant strategies and policies to improve environmental
health requires the knowledge, analytical methods, and data collection tools developed from multiple
disciplines and applied at different scales. 2024 Meeting topics include application of sensors in exposure
assessment, citizen science and community-engaged research, climate change impacts on human
exposure, COVID-19, vulnerabilities in environmental exposure and health, new and emerging environmental
exposures, exposure data to policy action and impacts of public health policy, multiple exposures and
interactions, risk communication, statistical methods in exposure science and epidemiology, and
technology/sensors among others. There will be an added focus on environmental justice and
community engaged research as it relates to the field of exposure science. The 34th ISES annual
conference will be held in Montreal, Canada from October 20 - 24 , 2024 and will continue the success of
previous meetings. The meeting offers four and half days of cross-disciplinary presentations and discussions
of new research and methods of international, national, and regional significance and facilitates the exchange
of information and ideas among exposure science and environmental health scientists from academia,
government agencies, non-profit organizations, and industry. Conference attendance is expected to be
between 500-600 participants from North America, Europe, and Asia. ISES has encouraged attendance of
students and new researchers, as well as investigators from low- and middle-income countries over the last
6 years resulting in an average of 15% increase in the number of attendees. This proposal will support the
representation of students and new researchers from underrepresented backgrounds as well as provide an
opportunity for participation of community members, hence enhancing member diversity, promoting the
global development of exposure science, and fostering collaborations and information exchange both
nationally and internationally.",<Academia><Affect><Air><Area><Asia><Biological><COVID-19><CV-19><Canada><Collaborations><Communication><Communities><Community Participation><Complex><Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019><Country><Data><Data Collection><Decision Making><Developing Countries><Developing Nations><Development><Discipline><Disparities><Disparity><Ecologic Systems><Ecological Systems><Ecological impact><Ecosystem><Education><Educational aspects><Environment><Environmental Epidemiology><Environmental Exposure><Environmental Health><Environmental Health Science><Environmental Impact><Environmental Policy><Epidemiology><Europe><Event><Exposure to><Faculty><Financial Support><Food><Fostering><Funding><Goals><Government><Government Agencies><Health><Health Care Professional><Health Policy><Health Professional><Healthcare professional><Human><Hydrogen Oxide><Industry><International><Investigators><Knowledge><LMIC><Less-Developed Countries><Less-Developed Nations><Link><Mentors><Methodology><Methods><Modern Man><Names><Nature><Noise><Non-Profit Organizations><Nonprofit Organizations><North America><Oral><Participant><Peer Review><Policies><Policy Making><Public Health><Radiation><Research><Research Methodology><Research Methods><Research Personnel><Research Resources><Researchers><Resources><Risk><Scholarship><Science><Scientist><Societies><Statistical Methods><Students><Technology><Third-World Countries><Third-World Nations><Training><Translational Research><Translational Science><Travel><Under-Developed Countries><Under-Developed Nations><Vulnerable Populations><Water><amateur science><amateur scientists><analytical method><biologic><citizen science><citizen scientists><civic science><climate change><climatic changes><community based participatory research><community engaged participatory research><community engaged research><community led research><community participatory research><community partnered participatory research><community partnered research><community-engaged study><community-partnered study><conference><convention><coronavirus disease 2019><coronavirus disease-19><coronavirus infectious disease-19><crowd science><crowd-sourced science><developing country><developing nation><developmental><environmental agent><environmental justice><epidemiologic><epidemiological><exposed human population><extreme weather><financial assistance><global climate change><health care policy><healthcare policy><human exposure><improved><low and middle-income countries><low income country><meeting><meetings><member><name><named><naming><new technology><next generation><novel technologies><participatory action research><pathogen><posters><research and methods><scientific citizenship><sensor><statistic methods><success><successful intervention><summit><symposia><symposium><tool><translation research><translational investigation><vulnerable group><vulnerable individual><vulnerable people>,Climate-Related Exposures and Conditions; Social Determinants of Health
Examination of epigenetic spatial architecture in the CNS as a method to understand cocaine relapse in ecoHIV infected mice,Examination of epigenetic spatial architecture in the CNS as a method to understand cocaine relapse in ecoHIV infected mice,"This proposal seeks to develop a new imaging pipeline that will examine tissue level and nuclear level
spatial architecture of histone dopaminylation in the CNS of ecoHIV infected mice allowed to self
administer cocaine. To achieve this goal we will develop a new imaging pipeline that that collects large
numbers of images (>15,000 per animal and brain region) and analyzes them using a novel AI-powered,
machine learning approach.
 Substance use disorders (SUD) are a chronic disease of the CNS that are characterized by compulsive
craving that persists even after substance use ceases. The development of SUD is associated with a transition
in brain physiology that maintains drug seeking and taking. Epigenetics, the change in gene expression without
change to DNA sequence, and the underlying mechanisms of histone modification, transcription factor
recruitment and DNA packaging, is involved in an array of neurodegenerative diseases, including control of HIV
transcription. Furthermore, there is evidence that substance use drives changes in chromatin structure and
therefore may alter gene expression, and that these changes may play a role in relapse to drug use. Recent
studies have shown that dopamine can modify histones of cells in the CNS and that dopaminylation drives
cocaine seeking behavior in rodents. Techniques that can connect the available powerful single cell molecular
approaches and gross examination of the CNS by both traditional histology and modern non-invasive imaging
for the study of HIV and substance use have not been used extensively. We propose to address this technical
shortcoming by combining our strengths in epigenetics, high resolution imaging of the CNS, computational
biology and animal behavior. We will query sub-nuclear and tissue region architecture of epigenetic
modifications, including the newly discovered dopaminylation of histone H3 (H3Q5dop), analyze the resulting
data using a machine learning based pipeline, and then correlate this architecture to behavioral outcomes as
they relate to drug seeking behavior. In addition to the creation and testing of new technologies, we will address
the hypothesis that altered dopaminylation of histones in astrocytes is the mechanism by which HIV infection
enhances sensitivity to cocaine’s neurobehavioral properties. We develop our technology in the R61 exploratory
phase (Aim 1: Imaging of H3Q5dop and other epigenetic marks in nuclei isolated from mice self-administering
cocaine, Aim 2: Assess applicability of tissue clearing protocols to whole-tissue imaging of histone modification,
Aim 3: Determine applicability of NUCLEO-M and tissue clearing microscopy to existing tissue bank samples)

Molecular recognition by ADAR1 of Z-RNA within transcriptomes,Molecular recognition by ADAR1 of Z-RNA within transcriptomes,"Project Summary
RNA editing of cellular RNAs helps the cell distinguish between self and non-self RNAs. This
editing of adenosines into inosines is generally catalyzed by the `adenosine deaminase acting on
RNA-1' protein (ADAR1). A>I editing is augmented in tumors and upon infection, primarily
through the interferon-induced longer isoform of ADAR1 that comprises a Z-DNA/Z-RNA binding
domain named ‘Zα’ at its N-terminus. Misediting is implicated in neurological diseases such as
Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Z-RNA in the form of repeats of cytosine and guanosine (CpG) in a
left-handed double-helical conformation has been proposed in cells, but the prevalence of such
structures and their exact role are unknown. In addition, many —if not most— regions proposed
to adopt a Z conformation do not resemble regular (CpG)n. How these local Z-RNA conformations
are generated within A-form helices, stabilized and regulated by Zα of ADAR1, as well as their
exact role in the function of these RNAs, remain unknown. Our hypothesis is that the binding
of Zα to Z-RNA plays an essential role during the editing process. Here, we propose to
answer the following questions: What is the mechanism for Z-RNA formation at CpG but also
non-CpG sequences? How widespread are transitions to Z-RNA across transcriptomes? Is Z-
RNA sampled in the free form or only adopted upon binding by Zα? What are the structural
features of Z-RNA recognition by Zα at non CpG sequences? We will first dynamically
characterize the propensity of various sequence contexts to adopt Z-RNA conformations.
This aim will use advanced NMR methods to characterize the sequence of events that lead an
RNA region from A-form to Z-form. Second, we will determine the unbiased 3D structure of
RNA fragments bound to Zα in solution. Finally, we will identify and localize Zα binding
sites and Zα-dependent A>I editing events. This aim will take advantage of the robust
expertise and support for next-generation sequencing on our campus and at a contracted
company. Overall, our joint work as co-PIs will provide a structural rationale for the formation of
Z-RNA and the resulting formation of A-Z junctions across a variety of RNAs. We ultimately aim
to explain how the Z-RNA binding domain of ADAR1 increases the specificity and activity of
ADAR1. Our findings will help beyond this application with proposing a comprehensive
mechanism for ADAR1 editing and its RNA-mediated transcriptome-wide regulation, and
contribute to understanding disease such as cancer or auto-immune deficiencies.","<3-D structure><3-dimensional structure><3D structure><Address><Adenosine><Adopted><Adoption><Affect><Aicardi Goutieres syndrome><Alu Elements><Alu Family><Alu Repetitive Sequences><Autoimmune><Autoimmune Diseases><Base Sequence><Binding><Binding Sites><Biological Function><Biological Process><Biophysics><Brain Diseases><Brain Disorders><CREE ENCEPHALITIS><Cancers><Cell Body><Cells><Combining Site><Contracting Opportunities><Contracts><Cytoplasm><Cytosine><DNA Transposable Elements><Disease><Disorder><Encephalon Diseases><Encephalopathy with intracranial calcification and chronic lymphocytosis of cerebrospinal fluid><Encephalopathy, familial infantile, with calcification of basal ganglia and chronic cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis><Enzyme Gene><Enzymes><Event><Gene Action Regulation><Gene Expression Regulation><Gene Regulation><Gene Regulation Process><Geography><Goals><Guanosine><Human><IFN><Immune response><Immune system><Immunological response><Infection><Infectious Agent><Innate Immune Response><Inosine><Interferons><Intracranial CNS Disorders><Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders><Isoforms><Joints><Knowledge><Lead><Left><Left-Handed DNA><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Mediating><Methods><Modern Man><Molecular Configuration><Molecular Conformation><Molecular Interaction><Molecular Stereochemistry><NGS Method><NGS system><Names><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neurologic Disorders><Neurological Disorders><Non-Polyadenylated RNA><Nuclear><Nucleotide Sequence><Pb element><Play><Point Mutation><Population><Prevalence><Process><Protein Isoforms><Proteins><Publishing><Putative RNA-Binding Region><RNA><RNA Binding Domain><RNA Conformation><RNA Editing><RNA Gene Products><RNA Recognition Motif><RNA Seq><RNA Viruses><RNA sequencing><RNA, Messenger, Editing><RNAseq><RNP Domain><RNP Motif><RNP-1 Signature><Reactive Site><Regulation><Ribonucleic Acid><Role><Sampling><Site><Specificity><Structure><Techniques><Transposable Elements><Work><Z-DNA><Z-Form DNA><adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA><autoimmune condition><autoimmune disorder><autoimmunity disease><biophysical foundation><biophysical principles><biophysical sciences><cancer progression><conformation><conformational><conformational state><conformationally><conformations><dADAR><double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase><dsRNA adenosine deaminase><dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase><global gene expression><global transcription profile><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><host response><immune system response><immunoresponse><in vivo><infectious organism><malignancy><microcephaly-chorioretinopathy syndrome><molecular recognition><mutant><name><named><naming><neoplasm progression><neoplasm/cancer><neoplastic progression><neurological disease><next gen sequencing><next generation sequencing><nextgen sequencing><nucleic acid sequence><plasma protein Z><protein Z><pseudotoxoplasmosis syndrome><response><restraint><social role><three dimensional structure><transcriptome><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing><tumor><tumor progression><zDNA>",Genetics
Rescuing myelination in viral infections of the juvenile brain,Rescuing myelination in viral infections of the juvenile brain,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Viruses are well-established causes of central nervous system (CNS) disease in the most vulnerable
populations, particularly in the young and immunocompromised. During CNS infection, the immune
response can inadvertently cause neuropathology, resulting in neuronal death and demyelination.
Mouse models of viral infection have served as a valuable tool for dissecting mechanisms of
demyelinating disease in the adult brain, and a rich body of literature has revealed a complex role for
the immune response in demyelination. However, we know little about how viruses disrupt myelination
in childhood, when both neurons, oligodendrocytes (OLs), and immune cells are actively maturing.
Thus, true myelin restoration remains an elusive therapeutic goal in demyelinating diseases at all ages.
The long-term goal is to identify mechanisms to support the preservation and repair of brain cells in the
very young. The overall objective of this project is to evaluate the response of oligodendrocyte
precursor cells (OPCs), which ultimately give rise to myelinating OLs, during a viral infection in the
developing brain. Using a juvenile mouse model of neuron-restricted virus infection, where OPCs/OLs
are bystanders to the antiviral immune response, we have found that OPCs expand dramatically during
infection, and infiltrating adaptive immune cells are primary drivers of this OPC response. The general
hypothesis is that OPCs are spurred to proliferate by infiltrating B cells during a juvenile infection, but
that full-fledged OPC differentiation is ultimately impeded by virally-infected neurons. The general
hypothesis will be tested via the following the specific aims: (1) determine the protective role of juvenile
immune cells in promoting OPC proliferation; and (2) define the role of OPC maturation in recovery
from demyelination during a juvenile infection. In Aim 1, we will use genetic and molecular approaches
to define how OPC proliferation and maturation are regulated by subsets of B cells over the course of a
juvenile infection. In aim 2, we will assess how virally-infected neurons regulate the differentiation of
newly-generated OPCs using in vivo and in vitro approaches. The expected outcomes are that we will
define cellular and molecular interactions that direct OPC fate during a juvenile viral infection.
Collectively, these results are expected to have a significant impact by providing a basis for the
development of therapies to preserve or restore myelination in the young brain. This research aligns
with NIND's mission by generating fundamental insights into interactions between the brain and
immune cells, and by applying that new knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease in the
most vulnerable populations.",<0-11 years old><21+ years old><Academic Research Enhancement Awards><Acute><Address><Adolescent><Adolescent Youth><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><Age><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Automobile Driving><B blood cells><B cell><B cells><B-Cell Subsets><B-Cells><B-Lymphocyte Subsets><B-Lymphocytes><B-cell><Binding><Brain><Brain Inflammation><Brain Nervous System><Bystander Effect><CD 46 antigen><CD46><CD46 Antigen><CNS Diseases><CNS Nervous System><CNS disorder><CNS infection><Cell Body><Cell Communication><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Count><Cell Differentiation><Cell Differentiation process><Cell Growth in Number><Cell Interaction><Cell Locomotion><Cell Maturation><Cell Migration><Cell Movement><Cell Multiplication><Cell Number><Cell Proliferation><Cell Signaling><Cell-to-Cell Interaction><Cells><Cellular Migration><Cellular Motility><Cellular Proliferation><Central Nervous System><Central Nervous System Diseases><Central Nervous System Disorders><Central Nervous System Infections><Central Nervous System Infectious Disease><Central Nervous System Infectious Disorder><Central Nervous System Viral Diseases><Central Nervous System Viral Infections><Child><Child Youth><Childhood><Children (0-21)><Complex><Cues><Data><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Demyelinating Diseases><Demyelinating Disorders><Demyelinations><Development><Disseminated Sclerosis><Doctor of Pharmacy><Educational process of instructing><Encephalitis><Encephalon><Genetic><Goals><Immune><Immune Globulins><Immune response><Immunes><Immunization><Immunocompromised><Immunocompromised Host><Immunocompromised Patient><Immunoglobulins><Immunological response><Immunosuppressed Host><In Vitro><Infection><Infiltration><Inflammation><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigators><Knowledge><Left><Literature><MCP antigen><Measles virus><Mediating><Mentors><Mice><Mice Mammals><Mission><Modeling><Molecular><Molecular Interaction><Multiple Sclerosis><Murine><Mus><Myelin><Natural regeneration><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neural Cell><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neuraxis><Neurocyte><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Deficit><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neurologic Disorders><Neurological Disorders><Neurons><Neurosciences><Oligodendrocytes><Oligodendrocytus><Oligodendroglia><Oligodendroglia Cell><Outcome><Output><Pathogenicity><Patients><Ph D student><Ph D. student><Ph.

"A Growing Crisis of Novel Injection-Related Wounds and Skin & Soft Tissue Infections among People Who Inject Drugs: A Community-Based, Longitudinal Investigation in North Carolina","A Growing Crisis of Novel Injection-Related Wounds and Skin & Soft Tissue Infections among People Who Inject Drugs: A Community-Based, Longitudinal Investigation in North Carolina","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We propose a community-based, longitudinal, mixed-methods study to investigate the growing crisis of
injection-related wounds and skin and soft tissue infections (IWSSTIs) among people who inject drugs
(PWID) in the United States. Lost among the data on skyrocketing overdose deaths is an alarming increase
in the prevalence and severity of novel IWSSTIs. IWSSTIs are a leading cause of morbidity for PWID and
the most common cause of hospitalizations. More than 100,000 IWSSTIs have occurred annually since
2018. When left untreated, IWSSTIs can become septic, gangrene, and progress to catastrophic infections
that require complicated surgeries and long-term medical care. IWSSTIs can stress hospital systems
already overburdened with COVID-19, consume limited Medicaid funding, and increase stigma toward
PWID. While IWSSTIs have been a concern for PWID for decades, rising incidence of dermal reactions and
antinociceptive effects from synthetic drugs and novel psychoactive substances (NPS) represents a new
and emerging public health crisis. The Office of National Drug Control Policy recently listed xylazine as an
emerging threat and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned of xylazine’s growing
involvement in fentanyl overdose deaths. Aim 1: To observe, examine, and typologize IWSSTIs by DSS
factors through Consensus-based Clinical Case Reporting Guideline Development (CARE)26-informed case
reports, ethnographic interviews, and community-based drug checking among a qualitative sample of 30
PWID (15/site) in western NC; Aim 2: To examine associations between DSS factors and IWSSTI risk
among a longitudinal cohort of PWID in NC (N = 450). To achieve these aims, we will recruit PWID from
SSPs, homeless encampments, motels, and other places where PWID reside and congregate at the two
study sites and surrounding counties (see Facilities). Aim 1 will be accomplished using targeted sampling
methods and Aim 2 will be accomplished using respondent-driven sampling (RDS). The study will be led by
Principal Investigator Jon Zibbell, a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)–funded behavioral scientist
with many years of experience studying injection drug use and infectious disease risk among PWID. The
team also includes William Zule, a NIDA-funded epidemiologist; Arnie Aldridge, a National Institutes of
Health–funded statistician; Asher Schranz, a physician and medical expert in injection-related infectious
diseases; and Sarah Duhart Clarke, an applied psychologist. Findings from the proposed study will help
characterize the etiology and unique features of IWSSTs by DSS factors and quantify xylazine prevalence
in the illicit drug supply in western NC. Because growing xylazine contamination and sharp growth in novel
IWSSTIs among PWID together comprise an emerging crisis, these data are time sensitive, and the
proposed study is poised to make a timely and effective contribution to inform public health response.",<Abscess><Actiq><Active Follow-up><Address><Amputation><Animals><Ankle><Appalachia><Appalachian><Appalachian Region><Appearance><Ataractics><Behavior><Behavioral><COVID-19><CV-19><Caring><Case Study><Causality><Centers for Disease Control><Centers for Disease Control and Prevention><Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)><Characteristics><Chemical Burns><Chronic><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Communicable Diseases><Communities><Consensus><Consumption><Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019><County><Cutaneous Nodule><Data><Data Collection><Dermal><Dermatologic><Dermatological><Development><Drug Contamination><Drugs><Duragesic><Dysfunction><Environment><Epidemiologist><Ethnography><Etiology><Exhibits><Exposure to><Fentanest><Fentanyl><Fentyl><Fingers><Food><Functional disorder><Funding><Future><Gangrene><Generalized Growth><Growth><Guidelines><Health><Homelessness><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Hospitals><Illicit Drugs><Incidence><Infection><Infectious Disease Pathway><Infectious Diseases><Infectious Disorder><Infectious Skin Diseases><Injecting drug user><Injection Drug User><Injections><Interview><Investigation><Irritants><Knee><Knowledge><Left><Letters><Link><Long-term cohort><Longitudinal Studies><Longitudinal cohort><Longterm cohort><Medicaid><Medical><Medication><Methods><Modeling><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><NIDA><NIH><National Institute of Drug Abuse><National Institute on Drug Abuse><National Institutes of Health><Nature><Necrosis><Necrotic><North Carolina><PWID><Panniculitis><Participant><Persons><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phentanyl><Physicians><Physiopathology><Pilot Projects><Poison><Policies><Prevalence><Principal Investigator><Property><Psychologist><Public Health><Reaction><Regio tarsalis><Reporting><Research><Respondent><Risk><Risk Factors><Risk Marker><Sampling><Scientist><Sedation procedure><Severities><Site><Skin Nodule><Skin Tissue><Soft Tissue Infections><Source><Stress><Surgical complication><Survey Instrument><Surveys><System><Time><Tissue Growth><Toes><Toxic Chemical><Toxic Substance><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Tranquilizing Agents><Tranquillizing Drugs><Typology><United States><United States Centers for Disease Control><United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention><United States National Institutes of Health><Wound Infection><Xylaxine><Xylazine><active followup><antinociception><antinociceptive><case report><causation><chronic ulcer><coronavirus disease 2019><coronavirus disease-19><coronavirus infectious disease-19><cutaneous infection><cutaneous tissue><developmental><disease causation><disease risk><disorder risk><drug/agent><ethnographic><experience><fentanyl overdose><fentanyl test><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><homeless><infected skin><infected wound><injection drug use><long-term study><longitudinal outcome studies><longterm study><non-healing ulcer><nonhealing ulcer><novel><ontogeny><overdose death><overdose fatalities><pathophysiology><people who inject drugs><people who inject illicit drugs><persons who inject drugs><pilot study><recruit><research study><response><risk predictor><risk predictors><sedation><septic><skin infection><skin ulcer><social stigma><stigma><surgery complication><synthetic drug><test for fentanyl><test strip><tissue wound><toxic compound><tranquilizer><ulcerative wounds><unhoused><wound><wound assessment><wound care><wound monitoring><wounding><wounds>,Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Fentanyl Misuse and Addiction; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Infectious Diseases; Opioid Misuse and Addiction; Opioids; Rural Health; Social Determinants of Health; Substance Misuse; Wound Healing and Care
mSaada: A Mobile Health Tool to Improve Cervical Cancer Screening in western Kenya,mSaada: A Mobile Health Tool to Improve Cervical Cancer Screening in western Kenya,"Abstract
Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among women in many low- and middle-income countries,
including Kenya. This is mainly due to the lack of screening, which remains the cornerstone of prevention for
the over one hundred million reproductive-aged women who fall outside the target age group or live in
countries where the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is not available. While HPV-based screening has
the potential to be incorporated into simplified protocols, the laboratory testing component requires programs to
have capacity to track specimens, results and patient follow-up, which can be a challenge in settings with
limited healthcare infrastructure and no electronic medical records. Further, low baseline knowledge of HPV
and cervical cancer risk in the community is associated with low rates of screening and follow-up, making
effective outreach and education a key component of screening programs. This work is often done by
community health volunteers (CHVs) with limited content-specific training. We propose to fill these gaps
through an integrated digital platform that includes a mobile app (mSaada) that supports CHVs with patient and
specimen tracking and follow-up, and counseling and protocol support. In the R21 phase of this project, we will:
(1) work with key stakeholders and local and international developers to finalize the mSaada platform, building
on the existing prototype to add patient and specimen tracking functionality; and (2) carry out a pilot study to
identify the patient, provider and health system factors necessary to design a trial to evaluate mSaada
effectiveness and implementation factors. We will carry out a six-month pilot in two health facilities providing
HPV-based screening, and use performance metrics including system usage rates, workflow observations and
qualitative data to guide the planning of a cluster-randomized clinical trial (c-RCT) to determine effectiveness of
mSaada. In the R33 phase of the project, we will use a hybrid implementation effectiveness design to: (1)
conduct an 18-month c-RCT across 12 health facilities to determine the impact of mSaada on cervical cancer
screening uptake, treatment acquisition and cervical cancer knowledge levels among women in the community;
and (2) measure the requisite implementation factors for mSaada effectiveness, sustainability, and scale-up.
The rigorous study design will allow us to determine the clinical impact of mSaada, ensure the local and
regional infrastructure has the capacity necessary for sustainability and develop strategies for widespread
implementation and scale-up. Collaboration with key stakeholders from the Kenya Ministry of Health will
facilitate the development of a long-term sustainability plan as the country moves toward HPV-based cervical
cancer screening. We anticipate the mSaada platform will play a pivotal role in facilitating the introduction of
HPV-based screening programs that can reach women in settings with limited health care infrastructure.","<Active Follow-up><Address><Adopted><Africa South of the Sahara><Cancer Burden><Cancer Control><Cancer Control Science><Cancers><Case Management><Cell Phone><Cellular Phone><Cellular Telephone><Cervical Cancer><Cervical Cancer Screening><Cervix Cancer><Clinic><Clinical><Cluster randomization trial><Cluster randomized trial><Collaborations><Communities><Community Health><Computerized Medical Record><Counseling><Country><Data><Data Collection><Decision Making><Development><Education and Outreach><Effectiveness><Electronic Medical Record><Electronics><Eligibility><Eligibility Determination><Ensure><Focus Groups><Future><Guidelines><HPV><HPV Vaccination><HPV induced cancer><HPV malignancy><HPV+ cancer><HPV-Related Malignancy><HPV-associated cancer><HPV-associated malignancy><HPV-related cancer><Health><Health Facilities><Health care facility><Health system><Healthcare><Healthcare Facility><Human Papilloma Virus><Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination><Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignancy><Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm><Human Papilloma Virus-associated cancer><Human Papilloma Virus-associated malignancy><Human Papilloma Virus-related cancer><Human Papillomavirus><Human Papillomavirus Vaccination><Human Resources><Human papillomavirus cancer><Human papillomavirus induced cancer><Human papillomavirus malignancy><Human papillomavirus-Related Malignancy><Human papillomavirus-Related Malignant Neoplasm><Individual><Infectious Human Wart Virus><Information Management><Infrastructure><Instruction and Outreach><International><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Interview><Kenya><Knowledge><LMIC><Laboratories><Low-resource area><Low-resource community><Low-resource environment><Low-resource region><Low-resource setting><Malignant Cervical Neoplasm><Malignant Cervical Tumor><Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Malignant Tumor of the Cervix><Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri><Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm><Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor><Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri><Manpower><Measures><Mobile Phones><Modeling><Morbidity><Morbidity -

Somos Esenciales: Community Revitalization and Health through Latino Arts and Entrepreneurship,Somos Esenciales: Community Revitalization and Health through Latino Arts and Entrepreneurship,"Abstract
Somos Esenciales: Community Revitalization and Health through Latino Arts and
Entrepreneurship is a comprehensive community revitalization plan led by Cultura y Arte Nativa
de Las Americas (CANA) in San Francisco’s Mission District in collaboration with government
and community partners, that targets upstream social and policy determinants of health.
Structural targets include combining an affordable housing/home ownership initiative, urban
gardening and food distribution, harnessing economic development through transforming empty
storefronts with Latino entrepreneurship, and providing culturally responsive wellness and
mental healthcare. These efforts are a clear continuation and extension of CANA’s work and
mission, critical for mental health (e.g., depression and anxiety), physical health (e.g., chronic
illnesses such as hypertension, diabetes) and economic well-being of our families and
community in a post COVID-19 recovery environment. Central to this collaborative plan is a
community-based participatory action research approach with local Latino laborers, domestic
workers, and cultural producers, in collaboration with professional health services researchers
at UCSF, whose goal together is to identify the relationship between systemic inequities, racial
disparities, and physical and mental health outcomes. CANA and its partners will utilize this
research as part of the NIH Common Fund launched by the Community Partnerships to
Advance Science for Society, and to create and implement a multi-platform COVID-19 recovery
plan and community revitalization for Latino, Indigenous, and Black residents of San Francisco’s
Mission District that brings opportunities for all to thrive through community revitalization and
structural interventions focused on home ownership, food access, bilingual health and wellness,
and economic workforce development.",<Address><Admission><Admission activity><Adrenal Glands><Adrenals><Affect><American Indian><American Indians><Americas><Anxiety><Area><Arts><Black><Black

Pathogenic exosomes during herpes zoster mediate increased vascular dementia risk,Pathogenic exosomes during herpes zoster mediate increased vascular dementia risk,"Project Summary: Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia. Therapies aim to
control risk factors (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus) to prevent development or
worsening of disease. Recent studies show that viral infections are potentially modifiable risk factors for
dementia. Amongst all pathogens, varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the most likely contributor to vascular
dementia. VZV is a neurotropic DNA virus that is latent in >95% of Americans and reactivates to produce
herpes zoster (shingles) in 50% by 85 years of age. Despite the availability of zoster vaccines, there are still >1
mil cases of zoster annually. Recent studies reveal zoster increases dementia risk and treatment (vaccines,
antivirals) reduces risk. Importantly, a recent FinnGen and U.K. biobank study showed VZV was specifically
associated with an increased risk of vascular dementia. VZV likely contributes to vascular dementia risk
through its well-established ability to produce vascular pathology leading to ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke
(VZV vasculopathy). VZV directly infects cerebral arteries and causes a vasculitis, as well as induces a
prothrombotic state triggering cerebral thrombosis. A notable feature is the involvement of soluble factors that
promote vasculitis or thrombosis distal from the site of rash. We recently showed that plasma exosomes
isolated from acute zoster patients contained significantly elevated prothrombotic and proinflammatory proteins
including thrombospondin-1, caveolae-associated protein 2, coagulation factors V and XIIIA1, calmodulin 1,
and transthyretin compared to matched controls. These exosomes were non-infectious but induced IL-6 and
IL-8 secretion when applied to naïve primary human brain vascular adventitial fibroblasts, activated donor
platelets, and induced platelet-leukocyte aggregations supporting a proinflammatory and prothrombotic state.
Importantly, these exosomes persist for at least 3 months post-zoster, well after rash clearance and detectable
viremia. Overall, we hypothesize that circulating exosomes during zoster and in subsequent months will
promote vasculitis and thrombosis, thus providing a mechanistic basis for the increased vascular dysfunction
risk preceding vascular dementia. To test this hypothesis, we will isolate plasma exosomes from individuals
during acute zoster and at 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-zoster, as well as isolate
exosomes from matched control individuals during a single clinic visit. Aim 1 will analyze exosome content for
known vascular damaging proteins/miRNAs from matched control and zoster individuals over a 12-month
period. Aim 2 will determine the mechanism(s) in which non-infectious zoster exosomes promote vascular
dysfunction. Understanding how long-lasting pathogenic exosomes promote cerebrovascular disease during
and after zoster, thereby accelerating vascular dementia risk, is significant because it will potentially change
clinical practice with regards to duration of antiviral therapy and use of anti-platelet agents for zoster, as well as
increase support for vaccination to prevent rash and stroke, as well as to decrease vascular dementia risk.","<(TNF)-α><19S Gamma Globulin><3-10C><7S Gamma Globulin><AC Globulin><AMCF-I><APOE

Enhancing E. coli Nissle colonization with CRISPR-Cas immunity,Enhancing E. coli Nissle colonization with CRISPR-Cas immunity,"Project Summary
 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) prevalence is rising globally and live biotherapeutic products (LBPs)
have shown some success in relieving the symptoms of IBD. However, LBP efficacy has been limited in part due
to inadequate engraftment and colonization. Novel technologies are needed to identify and address the factors
limiting the engraftment and efficacy of LBPs in the clinic. Lytic and lysogenic phage predation has the potential
to inhibit the colonization of LBP strains and obstruct their engraftment. Bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems, while
extensively used for genome engineering, provide adaptive immunity against phage predation by degrading
foreign DNA in a programmable and sequence specific manner. Thus, the addition of a rationally designed
CRISPR-Cas system to an LBP can provide phage immunity and support bacterial survival in the presence of
phage predation. Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is an LBP with a long history of human use for a variety of
applications, including treatment of UC and as a chassis for the delivery of therapeutic payloads. However, like
most LBPs, EcN variably engrafts in patients, which can limit its utility in the clinic. We have identified and isolated
EcN phages from stool samples of patients with UC, and further validated the existence of these phages in in
vitro experiments. This work suggests that these phages could directly prevent the survival and efficacy
of this therapeutically significant strain in the clinic.
 Ancilia Bioscience’s long-term goal is to harness CRISPR’s natural function to develop a new class of
LBPs with enhanced engraftment and therapeutic efficacy. The overall objective of this proposal is to improve
EcN colonization in the presence of phage. Our central hypothesis is that phages can directly prevent the
therapeutic efficacy of LBPs. By strategically engineering CRISPR, we can immunize EcN to robustly colonize
the intestinal tract and increase bacterial engraftment. This proposal aims to investigate phage immunity as a
method to augment EcN therapeutic efficacy and fitness in the context of IBD. These studies will be executed
by Ancilia Biosciences through collaborations with Dr. Rodolphe Barrangou, Todd R. Klaenhammer
Distinguished Professor at NC State University, and Dr. Casey Theriot, Associate Professor in Infectious
Disease at NC State University. Furthermore, we expect these results to establish the feasibility of engineering
CRISPR-Cas immunity for improved bacterial engraftment to enable the therapeutic efficacy and
commercialization of LBPs for a range of applications.",<Acute><Address><Adrenal Cortex Hormones><Adverse effects><Bacteria><Bacterial Genome><Bacteriophages><Biologic Sciences><Biological Response Modifier Therapy><Biological Sciences><Biological Therapy><Bioscience><Bloody diarrhea><CRISPR><CRISPR/Cas system><Clinic><Clinical><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats><Colitis><Collaborations><Communicable Diseases><Corticoids><Corticosteroids><Crohn disease><Crohn's><Crohn's disease><Crohn's disorder><Cytolysis><DNA><DSS colitis><DSS model><DSS mouse model><DSS-induced acute colitis><DSS-induced colitis><Deoxyribonucleic Acid><Development><Disease><Disorder><Dysfunction><E coli><E. coli><Economic Burden><Engineering><Engraftment><Environmental Factor><Environmental Risk Factor><Escherichia coli><Functional disorder><GI colonization><GI microbiome><Genetic><Genome engineering><Goals><Granulomatous Enteritis><Hemorrhagic colitis><Hemorrhagic diarrhea><History><Human><IMiD><Immune modulatory therapeutic><Immunity><Immunize><In Vitro><Infectious Disease Pathway><Infectious Diseases><Infectious Disorder><Inflammation><Inflammatory Bowel Diseases><Inflammatory Bowel Disorder><Intestinal><Intestinal Diseases><Intestinal Disorder><Intestines><Life Sciences><Lysis><Lytic><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Mission><Modality><Modern Man><Murine><Mus><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Outcome><Pathogenesis><Patients><Phages><Physiopathology><Predatory Behavior><Prevalence><Recording of previous events><Research><Role><System><Therapeutic><Treatment Efficacy><Ulcerated Colitis><Ulcerative Colitis><United States National Institutes of Health><Universities><Virus><Work><adaptive immunity><alleviate symptom><ameliorating symptom><associate faculty><associate professor><bacterial virus><biological therapeutic><biological treatment><biologically based therapeutics><biotherapeutics><biotherapy><bowel><burden of disease><burden of illness><colitis-induced dysbiosis><commercialization><decrease symptom><developmental><dextran sulfate sodium colitis><dextran sulfate sodium induced colitis><dextran sulfate sodium model><dextran sulfate sodium mouse model><digestive tract microbiome><disease burden><distinguished professor><eleocolitis><enteric microbiome><environmental risk><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><fecal sample><fewer symptoms><fitness><gastrointestinal microbiome><gastrointestinal tract colonization><gut colonization><gut microbiome><gut-associated microbiome><histories><immune modulating agents><immune modulating drug><immune modulating therapeutics><immune modulatory agents><immune modulatory drugs><immunomodulating agents><immunomodulating drugs><immunomodulator agent><immunomodulator drug><immunomodulator medication><immunomodulator prodrug><immunomodulator therapeutic><immunomodulatory agents><immunomodulatory drugs><immunomodulatory therapeutics><improved><in vivo><inflammatory disease of the intestine><inflammatory disorder of the intestine><insight><intervention efficacy><intestinal autoinflammation><intestinal barrier><intestinal biome><intestinal colonization><intestinal microbiome><intestinal mucosal barrier><intestine disease><intestine disorder><microbiome><microbiome components><microbiome members><mid-career faculty><midcareer faculty><mouse model><murine model><new technology><novel><novel technologies><pathophysiology><portability><predation><prevent><preventing><rational design><reduce symptoms><regional enteritis><relapse risk><relieves symptoms><social role><stool sample><stool specimen><success><symptom alleviation><symptom reduction><symptom relief><therapeutic efficacy><therapy efficacy><translational impact>,Autoimmune Disease; Biotechnology; Digestive Diseases; Inflammatory Bowel Disease; Microbiome
Implementation of a qPCR-based assay for the quantification of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in immunocompromised patients,Implementation of a qPCR-based assay for the quantification of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in immunocompromised patients,"SUMMARY
 Long-term protection from viral infections is mediated by both the humoral and cellular immune pathways.
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy in the US and is characterized
by clonal plasma cell production, resulting in immune suppression and recurrent bacterial and viral infections.
 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody quantification are currently being used as clinical endpoints to determine
immune protection against COVID-19, and this information is even more relevant in immunocompromised
individuals who lack a humoral response, but are protected by the cellular immunity (i.e. MM patients).
 Despite the urgent need to quantify cellular immunity, the complexity and lack of scalability of traditional
methods (e.g. ELISpot, flow cytometry) to detect antigen-specific T cells has so far prevented large scale studies.
 To address this problem, we developed a direct qPCR-based rapid T cell activation (dqTACT) assay based
on ex vivo stimulation of whole blood samples with a pool of viral peptides (i.e.immunodominant peptides
covering SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein),
SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific T cells, and CXCL10,
followed by direct amplification of IFNG 𝛾 or IL2 which are produced by
 which is produced by monocytes and neutrophils in
,
response
to
T cell activation.
The overarching aim of this proposal is to develop and implement a qPCR method that can be used as a proxy
to measure the presence and functionality of antigen specific T cells in MM patients. Specifically, we hypothesize
that SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells might be a biomarker of previous infection and of efficacy of vaccination
strategies, complementary to quantification of the humoral response.
 In the UH2 phase, we will define analytical sensitivity and specificity and establish cut-off/thresholds and
appropriate positive and quality controls, accuracy and false result rate by comparing the dqTACT assay with
the gold standard assays such as flow cytometry and ELISpot for measuring cellular immune responses.
 In the UH3 phase, we will test the presence and persistence of cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in
convalescent and vaccinated myeloma patients. Well annotated patient populations will be used to define
sensitivity, specificity, and thresholds with response to clinical end-points, such as presence and persistence of
humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2. We will estimate the prevalence of the markers within vaccinated
myeloma patients. We will then extend our studies and use banked as well as fresh samples from our large
myeloma/immunocompromised population and healthy controls enrolled in IRB approved studies.
 The overarching goal is to use the dqTACT assay to test the presence of T cells due to natural infection or
vaccination in myeloma patients, possibly aiding in nationwide booster strategies or passive antibody infusion
support to protect these vulnerable population.

DIALS: supporting structural biology through open source diffraction processing software,DIALS: supporting structural biology through open source diffraction processing software,"Project Summary/Abstract
X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for determining the atomic positions of proteins, used by researchers at
synchrotrons and X-ray free electron lasers. Typically, the crystal is exposed to X-rays, which diffract and are
collected on a detector to create diffraction patterns. These patterns are processed by software designed to
seek out weak signal on the images and create datasets from which the protein structure can be solved.
 The DIALS diffraction data processing package is a mature product produced in collaboration between
LBNL and Diamond Light Source (UK) that has primarily been supported in the US by research funding. DIALS
is used at a number of synchrotrons world-wide for regular processing of user datasets and has been used at X-
ray free electron lasers for fast processing of large datasets collected at hundreds to thousands of images per
second. The program allows fast feedback of data quality when incorporated into automated processing that
allows users to quickly make decisions about beamline operation and experimental direction. This has allowed
researchers to produce high-impact structures in general biological fields, including human diseases such as
COVID-19 and malaria, and energy research such as photosynthesis.
 This proposal would create a US R24 National Resource for the DIALS diffraction data processing
package. The Resource would move DIALS funding in the US from primarily R01 research funding to a
combination of separate research funding and operational funding from this proposal. The operational funding
would be to support codebase optimization, maintenance, and refactoring, a build-and-release schedule, and
new robust and adaptable user interfaces. Further, it would provide user outreach and training, both for general
users, and through on-site training for beamline scientists to help with software integration into existing pipelines.
 The end result will be a well-maintained and documented software package used at synchrotrons and
XFELs for routine data analysis without user intervention, and robust support for difficult cases.",<Acceleration><Achievement><Achievement Attainment><Address><Adoption><Advisory Committees><Biological><COVID-19><CV-19><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Code><Coding System><Collaborations><Communities><Computer Software Tools><Computer software><Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019><Crystallographies><Crystallography><Data><Data Analyses><Data Analysis><Data Collection><Data Files><Data Set><Decision Making><Dependence><Designing computer software><Development><Development and Research><Diamond><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Documentation><Drug Design><Education and Outreach><Ensure><Environment><Exposure to><Feedback><Funding><Future><Goals><Graphical interface><Health><Human><Image><Individual><Instruction and Outreach><International><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigators><Libraries><Life><Light><Maintenance><Malaria><Memory><Modern Man><Molecular><Outcome><Paludism><Pattern><Performance><Phase><Photoradiation><Photosynthesis><Plasmodium Infections><Position><Positioning Attribute><Process><Progress Reports><Proteins><Pythons><R & D><R&D><R24><Reading><Research><Research Personnel><Research Resources><Researchers><Resources><Roentgen Rays><Schedule><Scientist><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Single Crystal Diffraction><Site><Software><Software Design><Software Tools><Source><Speed><Structure><Synchrotrons><System><Task Forces><Technology><Testing><Training><Training and Outreach><Tutoring and Outreach><Update><Vaccines><Writing><X Ray Crystallographies><X-Radiation><X-Ray Crystallography><X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography><X-Ray Radiation><X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography><X-ray><Xray><Xray Crystallography><Xray free electron laser><advisory team><base><bases><beamline><biologic><biological signal transduction><cluster computing><combat><computerized data processing><coronavirus disease 2019><coronavirus disease-19><coronavirus infectious disease-19><data archive><data archives><data grid><data interpretation><data processing><data quality><datagrid><design><designing><detector><developmental><disease control><disorder control><distributed computing><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><file format><flexibility><flexible><graphic user interface><graphical user interface><human disease><imaging><improved><interventional strategy><large data sets><large datasets><open source><operation><operations><portability><programs><protein structure><protein structures><proteins structure><research and development><software toolkit><software user interface><structural biology><tech development><technology development><tool><x-ray FEL><x-ray free-electron laser>,Bioengineering; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Prevention
Targeting astrocytes to prevent motor decline in aging,Targeting astrocytes to prevent motor decline in aging,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the aged brain, reduced brain size and altered synaptic function are observed in conjunction with motor and
cognitive decline. Despite the importance of identifying what underlies these changes with aging, the molecular
drivers of brain aging and synaptic decline are not well characterized. Recently a role for non-neuronal glial cells,
i.e., astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, has been proposed in typical aging. Astrocytes are 15% of brain
cells and provide metabolic support for neurons, perform neurotransmitter recycling, and directly modulate
neuronal synapses in the developing and adult brain. Studies show mouse astrocytes undergo regionally-specific
molecular alterations with aging, with unique transcriptional alterations in astrocytes of the cortex, hippocampus,
striatum, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. In particular, astrocytes of the cerebellum show greater transcriptional
dysregulation than those in cortex, including upregulation of immune system genes in the interferon pathway.
Prior work identified loss of cerebellar neurons in aging, raising the question of whether regionally specialized
changes to cerebellar astrocytes that occur with aging contribute to this neuronal decline. To address this
question RNA sequencing of astrocytes from mouse and human, adult and aged, cerebellum was performed,
identifying Stat1 as a candidate transcriptional regulator of the heightened interferon state of cerebellar
astrocytes in the aged brain. Upregulation of Stat1 occurs concomitant with reduced numbers of excitatory
synapses in cerebellum, and mouse behavioral alterations that are linked to cerebellar function. In Aim 1
experiments are performed to ask if Stat1 is responsible for driving the aged astrocyte signature in the cerebellum
by: decreasing expression of Stat1 in astrocytes in aged mice using viral delivery of the RNA degrading enzyme
CasRx to ask if this is sufficient to revert cerebellar astrocyte aging signatures, and rescue synaptic and
behavioral deficits that are present; knocking-out Stat1 from adult astrocytes to ask if this is sufficient to prevent
the induction of aging-related alterations in cerebellar astrocytes; over-expressing Stat1 in cerebellar astrocytes
in juvenile mice to ask if this is sufficient to drive aging-related transcriptional signatures and motor decline. In
Aim 2 experiments address the cues that drive upregulation of Stat1 and the genes it regulates in aged cerebellar
astrocytes, focusing on signaling through the interferon receptor in astrocytes, and asking if the source of
interferon originates within the brain or in the periphery. These experiments will provide mechanistic insight into
the transcriptional regulation of aging-associated astrocyte states and reveal their contribution to synaptic and
behavioral decline in the aging brain.",<21+ years old><AD dementia><Address><Adolescent><Adolescent Youth><Adult><Adult Human><Aging><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><Ammon Horn><Architecture><Astrocytes><Astrocytus><Astroglia><Automobile Driving><Autoregulation><Basal Transcription Factor><Basal transcription factor genes><Behavior><Behavioral><Biochemical><Blocking Antibodies><Body Tissues><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Brain region><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Nucleus><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cerebellum><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive deficits><Cognitive function abnormal><Cornu Ammonis><Corpus Striatum><Corpus striatum structure><Cues><Data Set><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Development><Disease><Disorder><Disturbance in cognition><Dysfunction><Encephalon><Engineering / Architecture><Environment><Enzyme Gene><Enzymes><Excitatory Synapse><Expression Signature><Functional disorder><Future><Gene Expression Profile><Gene Transcription><General Transcription Factor Gene><General Transcription Factors><Genes><Genetic Transcription><Glia><Glial Cells><Goals><Health><Hippocampus><Homeostasis><Hortega cell><Human><Hypothalamic structure><Hypothalamus><IFN><Immune system><Immunity><Impaired cognition><Inflammatory><Interferon Receptor><Interferons><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Knock-out><Knockout><Kolliker's reticulum><Link><Mediating><Metabolic><Mice><Mice Mammals><Microglia><Modern Man><Molecular><Motor><Motor output><Murine><Mus><Nerve Cells><Nerve Transmitter Substances><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Cell><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurocyte><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neuroglia><Neuroglial Cells><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neurons><Neurotransmitters><Non-neuronal cell><Nonneuronal cell><Nucleus><Oligodendrocytes><Oligodendrocytus><Oligodendroglia><Oligodendroglia Cell><Output><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Pathway interactions><Performance><Peripheral><Physiological Homeostasis><Physiopathology><Primary Parkinsonism><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><RNA Expression><RNA Seq><RNA delivery><RNA sequencing><RNAseq><Recycling><Risk><Risk Factors><Role><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Source><Striate Body><Striatum><Synapses><Synaptic><Techniques><Testing><Tissues><Transcription><Transcription Alteration><Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene><Transcription Regulation><Transcription factor genes><Transcriptional Control><Transcriptional Regulation><Transgenic Mice><Up-Regulation><Upregulation><Viral><Work><adulthood><age associated><age correlated><age dependent><age linked><age related><age specific><aged><aged brain><aged mice><aged mouse><aging associated><aging brain><aging related><astrocytic glia><biological signal transduction><brain cell><brain size><cognitive defects><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive loss><decline in function><decline in functional status><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><developmental><driving><elderly mice><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><functional decline><functional status decline><gene expression pattern><gene expression signature><gene induction><gene manipulation><gene signatures><genetic manipulation><genetic signature><genetically manipulate><genetically perturb><gitter cell><hippocampal><hypothalamic><induction of genes><insight><juvenile><juvenile human><mesoglia><microglial cell><microgliocyte><motor deficit><nerve cement><neurodegenerative illness><neuronal><old mice><overexpress><overexpression><pathophysiology><pathway><perivascular glial cell><prevent><preventing><primary degenerative dementia><response><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><social role><striatal><synapse><synapse function><synaptic function><tool><transcription factor><transcriptional profile><transcriptional signature><transcriptome sequencing><transcriptomic sequencing>,Aging; Brain Disorders; Genetics; Neurosciences; Prevention
Investigating protein phase separation and aggregation in age dependent human disease,Investigating protein phase separation and aggregation in age dependent human disease,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our overarching goal is to determine whether a newly discovered form of macromolecular organization – protein
phase-separation – contributes to the age dependency of human diseases. Recently, it has been appreciated
that many proteins related to age-dependent disease have the capacity to self-associate, condensing to form
separate ‘phase-separated’ compartments called biomolecular condensates. In vitro, some of these protein
condensates can mature over time into toxic aggregates. However, the generality of this property is unclear, as
is the degree to which it may be altered for mutant proteins associated with different ages of disease onset and
progression. Our proposal leverages comprehensive libraries of human disease alleles along with biochemistry,
cell biology, and physiological modeling to investigate and define the contribution of protein phase separation,
and aggregation, to the age dependency of human disease processes. Many human diseases involve defects
in protein folding that can be amplified with age-dependent declines in protein quality control. Moreover, many
disease alleles arise within intrinsically disordered regions of proteins, which often control phase separation
behaviors. Yet whether disease alleles commonly create imbalances in protein phase separation and
aggregation processes is unclear. Taking advantage of comprehensive libraries of mutant proteins associated
with diverse human diseases, we recently investigated the phase-separation processes of more than two
hundred disease-associated proteins. These data revealed a strong enrichment for phase separation properties
among proteins with later ages of disease onset. In targeted follow-up experiments we also validated that disease
variants in those proteins had strong effects on their phase separation and aggregation behaviors. To define the
relationships between protein phase separation and the age dependency of human disease we will conduct the
following experiments: 1. Define phase separation properties of proteins driving diverse human diseases; 2.
Characterize aggregation and prion-like ‘seeding’ associated with human disease alleles; 3. Identify protein-
autonomous and age-related systemic drivers of altered phase separation in disease. We will also investigate
whether protein phase separation provides a mechanism to understand and potentially block the impact of
dominant disease alleles in the context of aging. Together, our proposal will define biophysical and systemic
features driving phase separation and aggregation, a critical aspect of many age-related disease pathologies.",<Active Follow-up><Address><Age><Age of Onset><Aging><Alleles><Allelomorphs><Attention><Automobile Driving><Behavior><Biochemistry><Biological Chemistry><Biophysics><C elegans><C. elegans><C.elegans><Caenorhabditis elegans><Cell Line><CellLine><Cellular biology><Chaperone><Client><Complex><Data><Defect><Dependence><Diffuse><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Equipment and supply inventories><Fibroblasts><Fluorescence><Fluorescence Photobleaching Recovery><Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching><Foundations><Future><Gene variant><Generalized Growth><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic Diversity><Genetic Variation><Genetic defect><Goals><Growth><Heterozygote><Human><Human Genetics><Image><In Vitro><Individual><Induced Neurons><Inventory><Kinetics><LRRK2><LRRK2 gene><LRRK2 leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene><LRRK2 protein><Libraries><Liquid substance><Measures><Membrane><Modern Man><Molecular Chaperones><Morphology><Mutation><NAC precursor><Nerve Cells><Nerve Degeneration><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neuron Degeneration><Neurons><Onset of illness><Organelles><PARK1 protein><PARK4 protein><PARK8 protein><Parkinson disease 8 protein><Partition Coefficient><Pathology><Phase><Phase Transition><Physical condensation><Physiologic><Physiological><Pilot Projects><Process><Property><Protein Region><Proteins><Proteome><Quality Control><Reporter><SNCA><SNCA protein><Shapes><Strains Cell Lines><Stress><Techniques><Time><Tissue Growth><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Training><Variant><Variation><Work><a-syn><a-synuclein><active followup><age associated><age associated alterations><age associated changes><age associated decline><age associated disease><age associated disorder><age associated effects><age associated impairment><age correlated><age correlated alterations><age correlated changes><age dependent><age dependent alterations><age dependent changes><age dependent decline><age dependent disease><age dependent disorder><age dependent impairment><age effect><age linked><age related><age related alterations><age related changes><age related decline><age related effects><age related human disease><age specific><age specific alterations><age specific changes><age-related disease><age-related disorder><age-related impairment><ages><aging associated disease><aging effect><aging related disease><allele variant><allelic variant><alpha synuclein><alpha synuclein gene><alphaSP22><alterations with age><asyn><biophysical foundation><biophysical principles><biophysical sciences><candidate identification><cell biology><changes with age><condensation><confocal imaging><cultured cell line><dardarin><dardarin gene><dardarin protein><decline with age><defined contribution><disease of aging><disease onset><disease phenotype><disorder of aging><disorder onset><driving><driving behavior><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><fluid><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><genetic variant><genome mutation><genomic variant><heterozygosity><human disease><iNeuron><imaging><impact of age><influence of age><insoluble aggregate><leucine-rich repeat kinase 2><liquid><membrane structure><mutant><neural degeneration><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neurological degeneration><neuronal><neuronal degeneration><non A-beta component of AD amyloid><non A4 component of amyloid precursor><ontogeny><physiologic model><pilot study><prion-like><protein aggregate><protein aggregation><protein folding><recruit><senescent cell><α synuclein gene><α-syn><α-synuclein>,Aging; Genetics
Fully Realizing Pangenomics Alignment,Fully Realizing Pangenomics Alignment,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Read aligners first build an index from one or more reference genome(s) and subsequently use it to find and
extend matched subsequences between sequence reads and the reference(s). The bottleneck of using these
read aligners to index thousands of human reference genomes is the space and time needed for construct
and store the index. Hence, in the case of the human genome, it is common to restrict interest to alignment of
the standard reference genome, i.e., GChr38. Yet, the absence of diversity in this single reference genome
can cause substandard results in downstream analysis, impacting the ability to identify and study genetic
variation.
 To address the shortcomings associated with using a single reference genome, the concept of a pange-
nomics reference genome has been introduced and adopted. For example, Giraffe, VG, and Moni all aim
to index a population of genomes in a manner that enables read alignment. Although, these pangenomics
aligners have been shown to improve on the accuracy over standard read aligners (e.g., BWA and Bowtie)
there exists several challenges that prevent these methods from being used in practice for downstream anal-
ysis, such as variant calling. The goal of this proposal is to develop algorithms to address these challenges
and fully enable pangenomics alignment. In particular, we will create methods for selecting (from a large
population) a subset genomes that will achieve the most accurate alignment results, develop a pangenomics
scoring scheme that will enable the alignments from a pangenome to be attained, and disseminate our
methods in a user-friendly manner that enables automated updates.",<ASD><Achievement><Achievement Attainment><Address><Adopted><Algorithms><Area><Autism><Autistic Disorder><Bio-Informatics><Bioinformatics><Biology><Collaborations><Collection><Complex><Computer software><Data><Development><Disease><Disorder><Early Infantile Autism><Encapsulated><Ensure><Feedback><Gene variant><Genetic Diversity><Genetic Variation><Genetic study><Genome><Goals><Human Genome><Infantile Autism><Investigators><Kanner's Syndrome><Licensing><Maintenance><Methods><Monitor><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Performance><Population><Primary Parkinsonism><Probabilistic Models><Probability Models><Reference Standards><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Scheme><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Scoring Method><Sequence Alignment><Software><Statistical Models><Structure><Time><Update><Variant><Variation><Work><allele variant><allelic variant><assess effectiveness><autism spectral disorder><autism spectrum disorder><autistic spectrum disorder><cancer sub-types><cancer subtypes><cost><data structure><dementia praecox><determine effectiveness><developmental><effectiveness assessment><effectiveness evaluation><evaluate effectiveness><examine effectiveness><genetic variant><genomic variant><human reference assembly><human reference genome><human whole genome><improved><indexing><interest><novel><open source><pan-genome><pangenome><prevent><preventing><public data base><public database><publicly accessible data base><publicly accessible database><publicly available data base><publicly available database><reference assembly><reference genome><schizophrenic><sequencing alignment><statistical linear mixed models><statistical linear models><telomere><trait><usability><user-friendly><variant detection>,Genetics; Human Genome
Treating Balance Impairment of the Elderly with TMS-induced Brain Connectivity,Treating Balance Impairment of the Elderly with TMS-induced Brain Connectivity,"Summary
Falls and fall-related injuries are a growing public health concern, particularly in regions of the
world in which high proportions of the population are elderly. When older adults are affected with
neurological conditions such as stroke, neuropathies, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis,
Alzheimer's disease, the risk for falling increases substantially. Falls and the resulting fear of falls
can mark the beginning of a decline in function, participation in social activities, and
independence, thus negatively affecting the quality of life. One in three people over the age of 65
years who are living in the community experience at least one fall each year. About 10% of these
falls are associated with serious injuries such as traumatic brain injury and hip fractures. Injuries
resulting from falls are the leading cause of hospitalization and financial hardships in older adults.
Loss of balance is one of the common precipitants of falls. Interventions in the form of walking,
cycling, structured exercises, and general medications are available, but do not significantly
reduce the risk of falling.
Older adults often have alterations in the brain balance circuit that cause ineffective responses to
prevent a fall when balance is challenged. In this proposal, we present early data from human
studies in which transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was guided by magnetic resonance
imaging [MRI] and electroencephalography [EEG] to focus on the supplementary motor area in
elderly subjects with balance disorders. These data show that the balance-circuit activation
patterns in those elderly patients changed to patterns resembling young healthy subjects, and
that short-term balance was improved (long-term balance improvement was not evaluated). Our
aim in the proposed Phase I project is to conduct a more comprehensive clinical study of these
guided TMS methods in the treatment of balance deficits in elderly patients with a history of falls.
If we are technically successful in this Phase I project, we intend to conduct Phase II definitive
studies that will validate the science to the satisfaction of the Food and Drug Administration. We
would then commercialize the technology by streamlining workflow and increasing patient access
through the fusion of the MRI, EEG, and TMS functionalities into a single compact mobile device
(aimed at treating balance deficits and other neurological disorders of the elderly). The new
balance-treatment device could be placed in geriatric or otolaryngology clinics, driven to patient's
homes, or rotated among nursing home facilities.","<65 and older><65 or older><65 years of age and older><65 years of age or more><65 years of age or older><65+ years><65+ years old><> 65 years><AD dementia><Absence of pain sensation><Absence of sensibility to pain><Adverse effects><Affect><Aged 65 and Over><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><Apoplexy><Area><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Brain Trauma><Brain Vascular Accident><CNS plasticity><Capital Expenditures><Cerebral Stroke><Cerebrovascular Apoplexy><Cerebrovascular Stroke><Clinic><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Collaborations><Communities><Compensation><Contralateral><Data><Dendritic Spines><Devices><Disseminated Sclerosis><Double-Blind Method><Double-Blind Study><Double-Blinded><Double-Masked Method><Double-Masked Study><Drugs><EEG><Elderly><Electroencephalogram><Electroencephalography><Encephalon><Equilibrium><Exercise><Fall prevention><Feels no pain><Financial Hardship><Food and Drug Administration><Generations><Glutamates><Hip Fractures><History><Home><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Human><Injury><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Investigators><L-Glutamate><Location><Long-Term Potentiation><Longterm Potentiation><MR Imaging><MR Tomography><MRI><MRI/EEG><MRI/electroencephalography><MRIs><Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Measures><Mediating><Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance><Medical center><Medication><Methods><Modern Man><Motor><Multiple Sclerosis><NMR Imaging><NMR Tomography><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neurologic><Neurologic Disorders><Neurological><Neurological Disorders><Neuronal Plasticity><Neuropathy><No sensitivity to pain><Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Nursing Homes><Otolaryngology><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Patients><Pattern><Performance><Persons><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phase><Physical Exercise><Pilot Projects><Population><Primary Parkinsonism><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Public Health><QOL><Quality of life><Randomized><Recording of previous events><Recovery Support><Regimen><Research Personnel><Researchers><Rest><Risk Reduction><Rotation><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Science><Stroke><Structure><Synapses><Synaptic><System><Technology><Transcranial magnetic stimulation><Traumatic Brain Injury><Traumatic injury><USFDA><United States Food and Drug Administration><Urology><Walking><Work><Zeugmatography><above age 65><advanced age><adverse consequence><adverse outcome><after age 65><age 65 and greater><age 65 and older><age 65 or older><age > 65><age of 65 years onward><aged 65 and greater><aged 65+><aged ≥65><analgesia><balance><balance disorder><balance function><balance impairment><brain abnormalities><brain attack><brain circuitry><central nervous system plasticity><cerebral vascular accident><cerebrovascular accident><commercialization><decline in function><decline in functional status><dementia praecox><dendrite spine><disturbed balance><drug/agent><elderly patient><equilibration disorder><equilibrium disorder><experience><fall injury><fall related injury><fall risk><falls><fear of falling><financial adversity><financial burden><financial distress><financial insecurity><financial strain><financial stress><foot><functional decline><functional status decline><geriatric><glutamatergic><handheld mobile device><histories><homes><human data><human old age (65+)><improved><injuries><injurious falls><insular sclerosis><interventional strategy><magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography><mobile device><neural plasticity><neurological disease><neuropathic><neuroplastic><neuroplasticity><nursing home><old age><older adult><older adulthood><older patient><otorhinolaryngology><over 65 years><pilot study><prevent><preventing><preventing falls><primary degenerative dementia><prospective><randomisation><randomization><randomly assigned><reduce risk><reduce risks><reduce that risk><reduce the risk><reduce these risks><reduces risk><reduces the risk><reducing risk><reducing the risk><repair><repaired><repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation><response><risk-reducing><satisfaction><schizophrenic><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><senior citizen><social><stroke patient><stroked><strokes><synapse><traumatic brain damage><≥65 years>",Aging; Assistive Technology; Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Neurosciences; Physical Injury - Accidents and Adverse Effects; Prevention; Rehabilitation
Personalized multi-medication packaging with integrated real-time instrumentation to improve adherence,Personalized multi-medication packaging with integrated real-time instrumentation to improve adherence,"Abstract – Medication non-adherence is a persistent public health problem that impacts many patient
populations and causes all stakeholders—patients, families, pharmacies, pharmaceutical developers, doctors,
and insurers—to lose. It contributes to 45% of treatment failures, 700,000 annual hospitalizations, and one death
every 19 minutes, making it responsible for $100B in preventable medical costs per year. Medication non-
adherence occurs across diverse care settings, including in increasingly utilized (Covid and post-Covid) home-
based acute care and post-acute care programs. For example, a study of 50 patients at a Hospital at-Home
program found nine potential adverse drug events related to unintentional medication non-adherence. Similarly,
therapeutics have been kept off the market due to non-adherence during clinical trials, resulting in erroneous
conclusions. Many device- and app-based technologies have repeatedly failed due to the high cost and high
level of interaction required on the part of the patient or caregiver. To address the need for a cost-effective,
usable/deployable/scalable, and highly versatile solution for real-time adherence detection at the point
of care, Insightfil is developing a novel disease and medication-form agnostic technology platform using
Near-Field-Communication (NFC) tags to measure medication adherence and reduce non-adherence in
home-based settings with minimal need for technological interaction. Low-cost, disposable NFC tags are
attached to a variety of medication packages for automatic detection of the package opening, allowing the
moment of pill-taking to be captured via an accompanying smartphone application and entered into the patient
record without the need to optically capture information. In addition, the app delivers real-time, personalized,
context-sensitive notifications to encourage medication adherence to the patient’s care plan. Our Phase I pilot
study of an early prototype demonstrated that medication adherence improved from 64% to >95% with the use
of Insightfil technology which was maintained over 18 months. In Phase II, Insightfil will collaborate with UMass
Chan Medical School’s innovative Program in Digital Medicine to develop an NFC-enabled native app (Aim 1),
optimize the app based on iterative user-testing (Aim 2), and rigorously demonstrate acceptability and fidelity
(Aim 3) of the technology in home-based acute care, post-acute care, and outpatient settings The proposed aims
will advance Insightfil’s technology toward commercialization and adoption by demonstrating its utility to increase
adherence and improve patient outcomes across a variety of care settings and empirically and quantitatively
demonstrate the usability and accessibility of the platform. These key technical demonstrations will be leveraged
to fund a type-2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial, evaluating the technologies’ efficacy and
implementation within clinical workflow in preparation for commercial launch.",<Acute><Address><Adherence><Adoption><Adverse drug event><Algorithms><Ambulatory Care><Android App><Android Application><Architecture><Bleb><Blister><Bulla><Bullous Lesion><Care Givers><Caregivers><Caring><Case Study><Cell Phone><Cell Phone Application><Cell phone App><Cellular Phone><Cellular Phone App><Cellular Phone Application><Cellular Telephone><Cessation of life><Chronic><Clinical><Clinical Trials><Code><Coding System><Collaborations><Communication><De-implementation><Death><Deimplementation><Detection><Devices><Directly Observed Therapy><Disease><Disorder><Dose><Drugs><Electronic Health Record><Electronics><Engineering / Architecture><Evaluation><Event><Family><Funding><Health Care Providers><Health Personnel><Healthcare Providers><Healthcare worker><History><Home><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Hospitals><Insurance Carriers><Insurers><Investments><Maintenance><Marketing><Measures><Medical Care Costs><Medication><Medication Errors><Methods><Mobile Phones><Modification><Monitor><NCATS><National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences><Notification><Optics><Out-patients><Outpatient Care><Outpatients><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Patient Care Planning><Patient Recruitments><Patient Self-Report><Patient outcome><Patient-Centered Outcomes><Patient-Focused Outcomes><Patients><Pharmaceutical Agent><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Pharmaceuticals><Pharmacies><Pharmacologic Substance><Pharmacological Substance><Pharmacy facility><Phase><Physicians><Pilot Projects><Preparation><Primary Parkinsonism><Privatization><Public Health><Recording of previous events><Reporting><Research><Research Resources><Resources><Risk><SBIR><Self-Report><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Smart Phone App><Smart Phone Application><Smartphone App><Technology><Testing><Therapeutic><Time><Treatment Failure><Vesication><Visit><acute care><case report><cell phone based app><commercial launch><commercial product launch><commercialization><cost><cost effective><design><designing><digital medicine><drug adherence><drug compliance><drug/agent><effectiveness and implementation trial><effectiveness/implementation hybrid trial><effectiveness/implementation trial><electronic><electronic device><electronic health care record><electronic health medical record><electronic health plan record><electronic health registry><electronic medical health record><health care personnel><health care worker><health provider><health workforce><healthcare personnel><histories><homes><iOS app><iOS application><iPhone><iPhone App><iPhone Application><improved><in-home care><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><instrument><instrumentation><medical college><medical costs><medical expenses><medical personnel><medical schools><medication adherence><medication administration errors><medication compliance><medication non-adherence><medication nonadherence><mobile phone app><novel><optical><outpatient treatment><participant recruitment><patient oriented outcomes><patient population><pharmaceutical><pill><pilot study><point of care><post-COVID><post-COVID-19><post-coronavirus disease 2019><preparations><programs><prototype><school of medicine><sensing technology><sensor><sensor technology><sensor-based technology><smart phone><smartphone><smartphone application><smartphone based app><smartphone based application><technology platform><technology system><therapy failure><tool><treatment provider><usability><user centered design><user-friendly>,Behavioral and Social Science; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Dissemination and Implementation Research; Health Services; Patient Safety
Development of a blood-based test for neurodegenerative diseases,Development of a blood-based test for neurodegenerative diseases,"STTR Project Summary/Abstract
It is estimated that every fourth to fifth death in the US is caused by a neurodegenerative disease
such as Alzheimer’s, AD related diseases, or Parkinson (CDC Wonder database, 2022;
Alzheimer’s Association, 2022). However, there are very few therapies or even molecular
diagnostic tools to detect these diseases, so the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s and AD-related
neurodegenerative diseases relies primarily on cognitive assessments which typically only occur
with onset of dementia. With no diagnostic test available for the early detection of
neurodegeneration and no ability to differentiate between different neurodegenerative diseases
early on, it is unsurprising that over 43 % of primary care physicians report that they are
uncomfortable diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s (Alzheimer’s
Association, 2022). A diagnosis of ‘Alzheimer’s-type dementia’ also often serves as a placeholder
to describe a syndrome of memory loss that can result from various underlying disease causes,
and which may require different therapies. Therefore, we propose to use Covalent Protein
Painting (CPP), a novel platform technology that can detect, identify, and differentiate the
misfolded protein aggregates that characterize AD and related neurodegenerative diseases, to
develop a blood-based diagnostic test for neurodegeneration. Over 80% of primary care
physicians say they would welcome such a test, in particular if such a test could detect AD and
related diseases before patients are symptomatic or only show mild symptoms because it would
help them devise a therapy plan with their patient and allow them to be proactive. Better and
earlier diagnostics would also lead to better therapies, because one of the reasons so many
clinical trials for neurodegenerative drugs have failed is that participants are usually treated too
late, when symptoms are already apparent. Our test would allow earlier enrollment of patients in
clinical trials before too much damage has been done to the brain and would enable better
stratification of patient cohorts, both of which would accelerate and increase success chances of
clinical trials.","<AD dementia><AD detection><Acceleration><Acquired brain injury><Affinity><Affinity Chromatography><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer beta-Protein><Alzheimer disease

SysBio FAIRplex: a FAIR PLatform for EXploration of Systems Biology,SysBio FAIRplex: a FAIR PLatform for EXploration of Systems Biology,"SysBio FAIRplex
Abstract
We propose building the SysBio FAIRplex, a FAIR PLatform for EXploration of Systems Biology, to
accelerate the transformation of biomedical data from many sources into insights from many
researchers into improved health for all.
Our team includes leadership from the teams that built, harmonized, and manage platforms for many
directly related projects, including AMP AD, AMP AIM, AMP CMD, AMP PD, AMP RA/SLE, AMP T2D, and
the Global Parkinson’s Genetics Program (GP2). We have extensive governance, security, scientific, and
technical experience with the realities and complexities of real-world execution, which we will use to
mitigate legal, technical, contractual, and cross-organizational dependency risks.
Our four Aims represent the four FAIR principles, which we will use to maximize the value of the AMP
data ecosystem by (a) expanding the number and diversity of researchers who can find and access the
data; (b) increasing the number and variety of tools that can be used to analyze the data; (c) enabling
“big-N” science by combining silos into larger virtual cohorts; and (d) connecting the AMP ecosystem to
the larger NIH and global data and research ecosystem.
The SysBio FAIRplex system has
three layers:
 ● Discovery via a single
 portal for researchers to
 find relevant data and
tools
 ● Exploration and
 Analysis with a mix of
 graphical and
 computational tools,
 including the ability to
 transition from GUI to
code
 ● Data, combining
 federated access to
 original data with
 Figure 1: The SysBio FAIRplex Portal provides a single point-of-entry for diverse
 centralized access to
 researchers, providing access to point-and-click exploration tools and to
 harmonized data. cloud-based analysis workspaces.
We will take an iterative approach to implementation.
 ● We will start with early and broad activation of all workstreams in parallel, stakeholder
 engagement, and requirements clarification.
 ● We will then proceed with building initial prototypes of all systems on a subset of the data,
 including data harmonization, aggregate exploration, file search, and analysis workspaces. We
 will use those prototypes to get stakeholder feedback and to iterate on the requirements.
 ● Once the initial prototypes are up and running, we will iteratively add more data, add more
 tools, add more researchers, and gather more feedback.
We are excited about the vision of the SysBio platform, and look forward to FAIRplex making it real..

Neural mechanisms of gait disturbances as individualized digital biomarker trajectories in preclinical dementia,Neural mechanisms of gait disturbances as individualized digital biomarker trajectories in preclinical dementia,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) rank prominently among age-associated
neurodegenerative disorders, with Parkinson’s disease trailing as the second most common. Contemporary
studies on AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) have unveiled cognitive decline indicators mirrored in
nuances within gait and hand movements. These indications often emerge long before AD or MCI diagnoses
are confirmed. Consistently, research has correlated slowed gait with cognitive deterioration, elevated brain
amyloid levels, and an augmented AD risk. However, the interplay between systems influencing both cognition
and movement has largely been explored in separate studies. The depth of understanding around the cognitive
efforts required for gait initiation or motor planning remains scant. Though dementia screening traditionally
hinges on comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations and neuroimaging biomarker studies, gait and
movement assessment offers a more direct approach. Crucially, motor features remain unaffected by
language, educational background, or cognitive capabilities, positioning them as unbiased and consistent
evaluative instruments. For example, the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) tests can be easily
conducted at home and monitored, even using smartphone applications. In this project, we chart a course to
harness cutting-edge AI and computer vision (CV) tools to aid in distinguishing diverse dementia and MCI
subtypes, such as AD-related MCI versus MCI with PD pathologies. Our approach integrates multi-modal brain
imaging with gait and movement data from videos, aiming to extract nuanced markers for phenotyping
(pre)clinical AD. These markers can then serve as precise digital trackers for both the progression and
distinction of age-related degenerative disorders. Ultimately, we aspire to enhance the understanding of the
intricate links between gait, movement, and cognition in aging and AD/ADRD scenarios.","<3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><AD dementia><AD pathology><AD related dementia><ADRD><Abnormal gait><Activities of

Dynamic Functional Mapping of Alzheimer's Spectrum and HIV-related Brain Dysfunction,Dynamic Functional Mapping of Alzheimer's Spectrum and HIV-related Brain Dysfunction,"Project Summary/Abstract
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains a critical problem in patients infected with HIV, but it is also commonly
seen in patients with diabetes, early Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, and many other conditions,
and in its mildest form is also a feature of healthy aging. Over six million Americans are currently living with AD
spectrum conditions (i.e., AD/MCI) and roughly half of patients infected with HIV are cognitively impaired, not to
mention the vast numbers with other etiologies. Thus, there is a clear and immediate need to understand the
neurophysiological basis of these impairments and, in the context of HIV, these needs are central to PAR-24-091,
which calls for innovative approaches to identify how HIV specifically primes the system for cognitive decline.
While the mechanisms that underlie cognitive impairment are poorly understood, many studies have probed the
systems-level brain circuits that appear to play a prominent role. These studies have been largely successful in
identifying the circuits, yet we still have a limited understanding of the physiology and dynamics within these
networks, and the level of specificity to HIV related neuropathology versus cognitive impairment more generally.
Quantifying the neural dynamics in affected circuits is critical, as different oscillatory responses (e.g., theta, alpha,
gamma activity) have been found to code for distinct cognitive faculties, even when they occur in overlapping
regions of the brain. Further, current approaches have generally not probed the dynamics, and have not had the
sensitivity or specificity to reliability distinguish HIV-related pathology from similar conditions and/or healthy
aging. Thus, new tools and approaches are needed. Herein, we use an emerging dynamic functional mapping
method based on next-generation magnetoencephalography (MEG) to quantify oscillatory responses serving
cognitive task performance and spontaneous neural activity during rest in three demographically matched groups
(i.e., cognitively impaired adults with HIV, patients on the AD spectrum, and cognitively normal healthy aging
adults). Our novel dynamic mapping approach uses the latest in MEG instrumentation to provide spectrally
resolved maps with excellent temporal and spatial precision, which we will integrate with high-resolution structural
maps of areal brain architecture based on multimodal parcellation, maps of amyloid PET deposition, and a battery
of domain-specific cognitive assessments. Specifically, we will identify the oscillatory dynamics serving visual
attention and visuo-spatial processing (Aim 1), as well as neural entrainment (Aim 2), and quantify spontaneous
cortical activity at rest (Aim 3). Our overarching hypotheses are that these dynamic neurophysiological maps will
delineate unique pathological features underlying HIV-related cognitive decline relative to that observed in AD
spectrum conditions and healthy aging and predict domain-specific cognitive dysfunction. Importantly, our team
has extensive experience working with these patient populations and developing circuit-level markers of brain
pathology using advanced multimodal neuroimaging.",<21+ years old><AD dementia><AIDS Virus><Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus><Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><American><Amyloid><Amyloid Substance><Amyloid deposition><Animals><Architecture><Attention><Biological Markers><Brain><Brain Diseases><Brain Disorders><Brain Nervous System><Brain Pathology><Brain hemodynamics><Brain imaging><Brain region><Causality><Code><Coding System><Cognitive><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive deficits><Cognitive function abnormal><Collection><Data><Deposit><Deposition><Diabetes Mellitus><Disturbance in cognition><Encephalon><Encephalon Diseases><Engineering / Architecture><Etiology><Exhibits><Faculty><Follow-Up Studies><Followup Studies><Frequencies><Functional MRI><Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging><General Population><General Public><HIV><HIV 1 associated neurocognitive disorder><HIV Infections><HIV associated neurocognitive deficit><HIV associated neurocognitive impairment><HIV associated neurological disease><HIV associated neurological disorder><HIV induced neurocognitive deficit><HIV induced neurocognitive impairment><HIV neurocognitive impairment><HIV-1 associated neurocognitive deficit><HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorder><HIV-1 associated neurocognitive impairment><HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder><HTLV-III Infections><HTLV-III-LAV Infections><Human><Human Immunodeficiency Viruses><Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections><Image><Impaired cognition><Impairment><Intracranial CNS Disorders><Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders><Knowledge><LAV-HTLV-III><Literature><Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus><MEG imaging><Magnetoencephalography><Maps><Matched Group><Measures><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Murine><Mus><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neurocognitive Impairment in HIV><Neurocognitive Impairment in HIV-1><Neurocyte><Neurology><Neurons><Neuropsychologies><Neuropsychology><PET><PET Scan><PET imaging><PETSCAN><PETT><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Participant><Pathologic><Pathology><Patients><Performance><Persons><Phase><Physiology><Play><Population><Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging><Positron Emission Tomography Scan><Positron-Emission Tomography><Prevalence><Primary Parkinsonism><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Probability><Process><Publishing><Rad.-PET><Reporting><Resolution><Rest><Role><Series><Specificity><System><Task Performances><Time><Virus-HIV><Visual><Visual Perception><Visual attention><Visuospatial><Work><aberrant aging><abnormal aging><abnormal brain function><adulthood><aged brain><aging associated disease><aging brain><aging related disease><bio-markers><biologic marker><biomarker><brain blood dynamics><brain dysfunction><brain impairment><brain visualization><causation><cerebral hemodynamics><cognitive assessment><cognitive defects><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive function><cognitive loss><cognitive performance><cognitive process><cognitive system><cognitive task><cognitive testing><diabetes><disease causation><disease of aging><disorder of aging><dysfunctional age related change><dysfunctional aging><dysfunctional brain><experience><fMRI><healthy aging><healthy human aging><imaging><impaired aging><information processing><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><instrumentation><magnetoencephalogram><magnetoencephalographic imaging><maladaptive aging><mild cognitive disorder><mild cognitive impairment><multi-modal neuro-imaging><multi-modal neuroimaging><multi-modality><multimodal neuro-imaging><multimodal neuroimaging><multimodality><natural aging><neural><neural circuit><neural circuitry><neural imaging><neuro-AIDS><neuro-HIV><neuro-imaging><neuroAIDS><neuroHIV><neurocircuitry><neuroimaging><neurological imaging><neuronal><neuropathologic><neuropathological><neuropathology><neurophysiological><neurophysiology><neuropsychologic><next generation><normal aging><normative aging><novel><pathological age related changes><pathological aging><patient population><positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging><positron emission tomographic imaging><positron emitting tomography><prevent><preventing><primary degenerative dementia><resolutions><response><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><social role><spatiotemporal><synaptic circuit><synaptic circuitry><temporal measurement><temporal resolution><time measurement><tool><visual spatial>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Biomedical Imaging; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Dementia; HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences
Development of blood assays for multiple system atrophy and Parkinson disease,Development of blood assays for multiple system atrophy and Parkinson disease,"Summary
Clinical diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy
(MSA), two progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorders, can be quite challenging, especially at
early disease stages, due to the overlapping clinical symptoms among various parkinsonian disorders.
Biomarkers such as neuroimaging measurements and α-syn seeding aggregation assays (Real-Time
Quaking-Induced Conversion or RT-QuIC) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and some biopsy samples have
shown promising results in improving PD and MSA diagnosis, but simpler, less expensive, accurate,
and reliable biochemical markers, particularly those in easily accessible body fluids (e.g., blood), are
still urgently needed to aid in clinical assessments.
Growing evidence suggests that membrane-bound extracellular vesicles (EVs) play important roles in
cell-to-cell communication and signaling and the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases, including
PD and MSA. Additionally, EVs carrying unique disease-specific and functionally important cargo may
cross the blood-brain barrier and be detected in vivo in blood, suggesting that blood-based but brain
cell-derived EVs can be a valuable source of biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. We have
recently developed a new flow cytometry-based technology (Apogee) to analyze individual EVs carrying
brain cell-specific and/or disease-related protein markers in body fluids for improved biomarker
accuracy and utility. These sensitive and rapid assays directly quantify intact, individual EVs, without
extensive purification before quantifying disease markers, which potentially reduce inter-lab variability
and increasing the clinical utility of EV-based biomarkers. Further, in recent pilot studies, we and others
observed that applying modified RT-QuIC assays to plasma EV samples could clearly distinguish
between PD or MSA and healthy controls as well as between PD and MSA.
In this study, we propose to further fine tune and optimize our Apogee and RT-QuIC assays to analyze
EVs carrying both brain cell-specific markers (e.g., L1CAM or NMDAR2A for neurons, CNPase for
oligodendrocytes, and GLAST for astrocytes) and disease-related markers (e.g., α-syn species,
amyloid β and tau species). The optimized assays will then be validated for their performance in MSA
and PD diagnosis and differential diagnosis in two independent plasma sample cohorts. These
proposed experiments will likely establish two compensatory blood-based biomarker assays for MSA
and PD – a rapid screening tool (Apogee) and a more accurate assay (RT-QuIC) to replace
corresponding CSF assays. Both assays can be used in future larger-scale MSA and PD biomarker
studies, which may establish the foundation leading to inexpensive and widely available blood tests to
aid in PD/MSA diagnosis and/or disease tracking.","<2',3'-Cyclic-Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases><AD dementia><Accuracy of Diagnosis><Address><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer beta-Protein><Alzheimer

Investigating the role of CSF flow in regulating CNS-adjacent bone marrow-derived myeloid cell egress after spinal cord injury,Investigating the role of CSF flow in regulating CNS-adjacent bone marrow-derived myeloid cell egress after spinal cord injury,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a sudden catastrophic neurologic event resulting in incomplete or
complete loss of motor, sensory, and sympathetic function below the level of the injury. Consequently, due to
the significant physical, social, and vocational impact of this disease, it is not surprising that it results in a
notable decline in patient quality of life and increased socioeconomic burden. SCI results when a mechanical
force or forces are imparted on the spinal cord causing compression or transection of the cord. The delivery of
this mechanical force leads to the primary injury phase characterized by neuronal and glial necrosis, axonal
disruption, loss of myelin, disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier, hemorrhage, edema, and ischemia. These
pathologic processes then trigger a self-perpetuating secondary injury cascade, where among other features, a
robust inflammatory response including the release of cytokines and chemokines and infiltration by
inflammatory cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils is a hallmark. Historically it was believed
that there was little interaction between the CNS and the peripheral immune system. However, with the
discovery of the glymphatic system, meningeal lymphatic vessels, and that the CNS-adjacent bone marrow
supplies the CNS borders with a robust and diverse pool of myeloid cells, this concept of CNS immune
privilege has undergone significant revision. We now know that following SCI, the CSF is able to communicate
with the CNS-adjacent bone marrow compartment through osseous bone marrow-meninge connections in the
skull and vertebrae. This signaling stimulates hematopoiesis and egress of myeloid cells from the bone marrow
back to CNS borders including meninges and perivascular spaces, as well as to the parenchyma. Currently,
the exact mechanism of CSF signaling to the CNS-adjacent bone marrow remains unknown. It is possible that
this signaling is simply through cytokines and chemokines carried by the CSF. As there must be bidirectional
movement within the osseous marrow-meninge connections, with CSF moving in one direction and myeloid
cells the other, an alternative explanation is that CSF can signal to the bone marrow through flow rate. In Aim
1, we hypothesize that the rate of flow of CSF to the CNS-adjacent bone marrow is capable of regulating
myeloid egress to the CNS borders and parenchyma. Further, in many CNS diseases it has been
demonstrated that impaired glymphatic CSF flow, waste solute accumulation, and neuroinflammation are key
pathologic features that tend to feed forward on one another. Consequently, in Aim 2, we hypothesize that
following SCI there will not only be disrupted spinal glymphatic CSF flow, but also CSF flow to the CNS-
adjacent bone marrow, and that this will promote increased myeloid cell migration into the CNS borders and

SCI, ultimately promoting neurologic recovery. We propose that therapeutically manipulating CSF flow to the

Mechanistic and Translational Investigations of HSPB8-associated dominant rimmed vacuolar myopathy,Mechanistic and Translational Investigations of HSPB8-associated dominant rimmed vacuolar myopathy,"Mechanistic and Translational Investigations of HSPB8-associated dominant rimmed vacuolar myopathy.
 Autosomal dominant mutations in the heat shock protein family B member 8 (HSPB8) have been
associated with (i) distal hereditary motor neuropathy; (ii) axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; and (iii) most
recently autosomal dominant rimmed vacuolar myopathy (RVM). Patients with HSPB8 RVM primarily develop a
distal myopathy in their 30s-40s, with proximal limb girdle weakness in their 40s-50s, and eventually become
wheelchair-bound. Muscle biopsy shows fatty replacement, fibrosis, and rimmed vacuoles. HSPB8 is involved in
chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA), and in conjunction with BAG3, recognizes and promotes the
autophagy-mediated removal of misfolded proteins. Our long-term goal is to develop a potent therapy to
stop/reduce the progression of HSPB8-associated dominant-rimmed vacuolar myopathy. Major gaps: The
mechanisms through which mutant HSPB8 results in aggregation, and the availability of treatments that preserve
or restore proteostasis by enhancing autophagy for HSPB8-rimmed vacuolar myopathies. Preliminary results:
To investigate, in vitro and in vivo, the molecular mechanism of HSPB8-associated myopathy, and to assess the
potential of new treatments, we generated: (i) patient myoblasts derived from induced pluripotent cell lines
(iPSCs); and (ii) a clinically relevant C57BL/6NJ-Hspb8 knock-in mouse model with the c.515dupC variant using
CRISPR/Cas9 technology which manifests myopathic weakness starting at 6 months. We demonstrated that the
HSPB8 fs mutant is associated with: (A) increased TDP-43 and autophagy markers in the patient muscle,
fibroblasts, and myoblasts. (B) The Hspb8 knock-in mouse muscle histology revealed central nuclei and muscle
degeneration with fibrous and adipose replacement; and immunohistochemical and biochemical studies
revealed aggregates, increased TDP-43, and autophagy pathology resembling human pathology. Our group
performed two high-throughput drug screenings and identified colchicine and trehalose to reduce the aggregates,
additionally, trehalose benefitted a mouse model of neurodegeneration. Hypothesis: Based on both in vitro and
in vivo studies, our central hypothesis is that mutated HSPB8 exerts a toxic gain of function, and leads to HSPB8
mutant aggregation. Our current results support the hypothesis that compounds that stimulate autophagy favor
the removal of protein aggregates related to HSPB8 fs mutations. Specific Aims: To test our hypothesis, we
propose three specific aims: Aim 1: To investigate the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis of HSPB8-
associated myopathy in vitro patient iPSC-derived myoblasts and the Hspb8515dupC mouse model. Aim 2: To
reverse the mutant HSPB8 pathology in vitro in patient myoblasts with an autophagy inducer trehalose. Aim 3:
To stop or reduce the HSPB8-associated myopathy by upregulating autophagy in the mutant mouse model.
Based on our previous studies, we will use trehalose in vivo in the Hspb8515dupC mouse model. Successful
completion of the present mechanistic and translational study will pave the way for the treatment of HSPB8-
associated dominant-rimmed vacuolar myopathy, and will also benefit other related disorders.",<AD dementia><Abscission><Address><Adipose tissue><Adverse effects><After

Visualizing and Manipulating Neuronal ESCRT Dynamics in vivo,Visualizing and Manipulating Neuronal ESCRT Dynamics in vivo,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The aim of this proposal is to elucidate how ESCRT (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport)
machinery is regulated and deployed in neurons. ESCRT is a set of conserved and sequentially-acting protein
complexes that play crucial roles in cellular processes such as endosomal traffic, cytokinesis, and membrane
repair. One important function of ESCRT in neurons is the formation of multivesicular endosomes, which are
critical for proteostasis, signaling, and the formation of extracellular vesicles that carry cargoes critical for
signaling and disease. Despite their central importance, the regulation of neuronal ESCRT complexes remains
poorly understood for two main reasons: First, we lack the tools to visualize their activities in vivo at high
resolution. Second, chronic disruption of ESCRT causes many pleiotropic and secondary phenotypes in
membrane traffic, making it difficult to decipher its mechanisms of action and to test the physiological importance
of ESCRT-dependent events. As a result, it remains unclear how cellular processes like extracellular vesicle
cargo traffic are spatially and temporally regulated within the polarized and complex morphology of neurons. Our
research seeks to fill this gap by developing new visualization and manipulation tools specifically tailored for
studying ESCRT dynamics, using Drosophila neurons as a model. In Aim 1, we will investigate the dynamics of
synaptic ESCRT machinery at endosomes, and explore how neuronal activity influences ESCRT dynamics.
Utilizing quantitative analyses of high-resolution microscopy, we aim to measure ESCRT recruitment to neuronal
endosomes and examine its relation to endosomal and extracellular vesicle cargoes. Aim 2 focuses on devising
new tools for temporal and spatial control of ESCRT and testing the kinetics and spatial organization of
multivesicular endosome biogenesis and the resultant release of extracellular vesicles. These tools will enable
us to engineer inducible systems for controlling ESCRT activities, investigate the temporal sequence of chronic
ESCRT phenotypes, and answer questions about the dynamics and regulation of extracellular vesicle release.
Overall, our research aims to provide mechanistic insights into synapse-specific regulation of ESCRT machinery,
shedding light on its role in synaptic function and disease. Furthermore, our tools will have broad applicability to
the field for studying ESCRT-related questions across different experimental systems, offering opportunities for
manipulating extracellular vesicle release and other ESCRT-dependent processes in diverse cell types or
organisms.",<AD dementia><Acute><Affect><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><Animals><Assay><Autophagocytosis><Binding><Bioassay><Biogenesis><Biological Assay><Biological Function><Biological Process><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Function><Cell Line><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Signaling><Cell membrane><Cell to Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell-Cell Signaling><CellLine><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Chemicals><Chronic><Communication><Complex><Cytokinesis><Cytoplasmic Division><Cytoplasmic Membrane><Development><Disease><Disorder><Drosophila><Drosophila genus><Encephalon><Endosomes><Engineering><Event><Flies><Future><Gene Proteins><Genes><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic defect><Goals><Human><Interruption><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Kinetics><Light><Link><Lipid Bilayers><Lipids><Macromolecular Protein Complexes><Maps><Measures><Membrane><Membrane Protein Traffic><Membrane Traffic><Metabolic Protein Degradation><Microscopy><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular Interaction><Morphology><Multiprotein Complexes><Mutation><Myoneural Junction><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Nervous System><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Nervous System Physiology><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neurologic><Neurologic Body System><Neurologic Disorders><Neurologic Organ System><Neurologic function><Neurological><Neurological Disorders><Neurological function><Neuromuscular Junction><Neurons><Organism><Origin of Life><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Pathologic><Pathology><Phenotype><Photoradiation><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiology><Plasma Membrane><Play><Primary Parkinsonism><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Process><Protein Gene Products><Protein Turnover><Proteins><Quality Control><Receptosomes><Regulation><Regulatory Protein Degradation><Research><Resolution><Rest><Role><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Sorting><Strains Cell Lines><Subcellular Process><Synapses><Synaptic><Synaptic Vesicles><System><Testing><Time><Vesicle><Visualization><autophagy><biological signal transduction><cell type><cultured cell line><developmental><disease model><disorder model><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><extracellular vesicles><field based data><field learning><field study><field test><fly><fruit fly><genome mutation><in vivo><inducible expression><inducible gene expression><insight><intercellular communication><lipid bilayer membrane><living system><membrane structure><mutant><nervous system function><neurological disease><neuronal><optogenetics><plasmalemma><primary degenerative dementia><protein complex><protein degradation><protein homeostasis><proteostasis><recruit><repair><repaired><resolutions><response><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><social role><synapse><synapse function><synaptic function><therapeutic target><tool><trafficking><vesicle release><vesicular release>,Neurosciences
Ubiquitin pathway modulators for treating pancreatitis,Ubiquitin pathway modulators for treating pancreatitis,"New approaches are needed to treat acute and chronic pancreatitis which is a major health problem in the US.
One novel approach is to promote mitochondrial health to protect pancreas from damages caused by various
stressors. We have identified important roles for mitophagy in resistance to pancreatitis. These new findings, in
the setting of the urgent medical need for new approaches to treat pancreatitis, led to this new SBIR application
to fully leverage prior discoveries. Ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is a key regulator of autophagic clearance
of damaged mitochondria. As such, activation of ubiquitin pathway enzyme critically involved in promoting
mitochondrial health is expected to have therapeutic effects. Pogenra’s UbiProTM drug discovery platform was
employed to discover novel, potent and selective activators of UPS enzymes. We demonstrated that UPS
activator inhibited pancreatitis in vivo. In this Phase I grant, we propose to evaluate these novel molecules for
their efficacy in cellular and animal models of acute and chronic pancreatitis and perform mechanism of action
studies. The ultimate commercial goal of this project is the development of small molecule UPS activators as
novel drugs that could treat pancreatitis.",<20S Catalytic Proteasome><20S Core Proteasome><20S Proteasome><20S Proteosome><APF-1><ATP-Dependent Proteolysis Factor 1><Abscission><Acinar Cell><Aciner Cells><Agonist><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Assay><Autophagocytosis><Binding><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Calcium><Calcium Channel><Calcium Channel Antagonist Receptor><Calcium Channel Blocker Receptors><Calcium Ion Channels><Cardiac Muscle Cells><Cardiac Myocytes><Cardiocyte><Cell Body><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell model><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Cellular injury><Cellular model><Cervical Carcinoma><Cervix Carcinoma><Cervix Uteri Carcinoma><Clinical Evaluation><Clinical Testing><Common Rat Strains><Data><Development><Disease><Disorder><E3 Ligase><E3 Ubiquitin Ligase><Enzyme Gene><Enzymes><Excision><Extirpation><FRET><Fibroblasts><Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer><Förster Resonance Energy Transfer><Goals><Grant><HMG-20><Health><Heart Muscle Cells><Heart myocyte><High Mobility Protein 20><High Throughput Assay><Hospitals><Human><Hyperactivity><Impairment><In Vitro><Inflammatory><KI mice><KO mice><Kidney><Kidney Urinary System><Kinases><Knock-in Mouse><Knock-out Mice><Knockout Mice><Lytotoxicity><Macropain><Macroxyproteinase><Mediating><Medical><Membrane Potentials><Mice><Mice Mammals><Mitochondria><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><Molecular Interaction><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Multicatalytic Proteinase><Murine><Mus><Neuroblastoma><Null Mouse><PARK6><PARK6 gene><PARK6 protein><PINK1><PINK1 gene><PINK1 gene product><PINK1 protein><PPAR gamma><PPAR-g><PPAR-γ><PPARgamma><PPARγ><PTEN induced kinase 1><PTEN induced putative kinase 1><PTEN-induced putative kinase><Pancreas><Pancreatic><Pancreatic Diseases><Pancreatic Disorder><Pancreatitis><Parkin><Parkin gene><Parkinson disease 6 gene><Pathway interactions><Peroxisome Proliferative Activated Receptor Gamma><Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma><Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ><Phase><Phosphatase and tensin homolog induced kinase 1><Phosphotransferase Gene><Phosphotransferases><Process><Production><Prosome><Proteasome><Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex><Proteosome><Rat><Rats Mammals><Rattus><Regulation><Removal><Resistance><Resting Potentials><Role><SBIR><Safety><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Specificity><Subcellular Process><Surgical Removal><System><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Agents><Therapeutic Effect><Thiazolidinedione Receptor><Time><Transmembrane Potentials><Transphosphorylases><Ubiquitilation><Ubiquitin><Ubiquitin Protein Ligase><Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase Complexes><Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase E3><Ubiquitination><Ubiquitinoylation><Uterine Cervix Carcinoma><VDCC><Variant><Variation><Voltage-Dependent Calcium Channels><acute pancreatitis><autophagy><cardiomyocyte><cell damage><cell injury><cellular damage><chemical library><chronic pancreatitis><clinical test><cytotoxicity><damage to cells><developmental><drug discovery><enzyme pathway><experience><health-span><healthspan><healthy life span><hiPSC><high throughput screening><human iPS><human iPSC><human induced pluripotent cell><human induced pluripotent stem cells><human inducible stem cells><iPS cell derived cardiomyocytes><iPSC derived cardiomyocytes><improved><in vivo><in vivo Model><induced human pluripotent stem cells><induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes><inhibitor><injury to cells><knockin mice><life span><lifespan><mitochondrial><mitochondrial membrane><model of animal><mortality><multicatalytic endopeptidase complex><new approaches><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new therapeutics><new therapy><next generation therapeutics><novel><novel approaches><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel strategies><novel strategy><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><overexpress><overexpression><pancreas disorder><parkin protein><pathway><pre-clinical development><preclinical development><protein kinase BRPK><protein kinase BRPK gene><recurrent pancreatitis><renal><research clinical testing><resection><resistant><serine/threonine-protein kinase PINK1><small molecule><small molecule libraries><social role><stressor><ubiquination><ubiquitin conjugation><ubiquitin-protein ligase>,Biotechnology; Digestive Diseases
The role of Huntingtin in endolysosomal trafficking and Huntington's disease pathogenesis,The role of Huntingtin in endolysosomal trafficking and Huntington's disease pathogenesis,"PROJECT SUMMARY
With no effective treatments or cures, ageing-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) present a pressing
threat to our society. Converging evidence links NDs to defects in endolysosomal trafficking, a vital cellular
process used by neurons to maintain their tidiness during normal aging. As one of the most extensively studied
NDs, autosomal dominant Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in
the coding region of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene that leads to an abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in
the corresponding encoded HTT protein. This results in a dominant neurotoxicity and potential alterations of
HTT’s normal physiological functions that together lead to the selective loss of medium spiny and cortical
projection neurons in the brain. Interestingly, defective endolysosomal trafficking has been observed in HD, and
HTT itself has been implicated in endosomal pathways from many in vitro studies. However, whether and how
HTT functions in endolysosomal pathways in a physiologic condition remains unexplored. HTT forms a tight
complex with its cognate binding partner HAP40, both of which are conserved in the model organism Drosophila.
By characterizing these two genes in Drosophila, I found in vivo evidence that HAP40 controls HTT in regulating
the functional convergence of endolysosomal recycling and degradation. Together with other evidence, they led
to my central hypothesis that through HAP40, HTT regulates Rab4 and Rab4-mediated endolysosomal
trafficking, a cellular process potentially disrupted by polyQ expansion in HD. For the F99 dissertation stage, I
propose to elucidate the molecular mechanism and functional consequence of this novel HTT/HAP40-mediated
endosomal trafficking by harnessing the power of multiple complementary model systems, including genetics
and genomics in fruit flies, live/super-resolution imaging in mammalian cells, and brain structure and function
analysis in mice (Aim1). Results from this study will define a novel and conserved role of HTT in endolysosomal
processes, uncover its underlying mechanism, and its physiological importance. For the K00 post-doctoral stage,
I plan to continue this direction of research but expand my training to new technologies such as human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)/brain organoids that are more related to humans and with more direct translational
potential, complemented with more systematic training in mouse ND models, to study endolysosomal pathways
such as the Retromer complex that are implicated in more prevalent NDs including Parkinson’s (PD) and
Alzheimer’s (AD) diseases. My goals are to understand how endolysosomal pathways contribute to different NDs
and whether membrane trafficking pathways can be targeted as novel effective therapeutic avenue to treat NDs
(Aim2). For both the F99 and K00 stages, I plan to devote extensive effort towards research training and
professional development. Overall, the proposed study will elucidate the function, the mechanism, and the
disease relevance of HTT in endolysosomal trafficking, with potential to identify disease-modifying drugs for NDs,
while providing me with the necessary professional training to become an independent investigator.",<AD dementia><Advisory Committees><Aging><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><Binding><Biochemical><Biologic Models><Biological Models><Biology><Brain><Brain Nervous System><CAG repeat><CAG trinucleotide repeat><CNS Nervous System><Cell Body><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Central Nervous System><Code><Coding System><Complex><Creativeness><Cultured Cells><Defect><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Development><Disease><Disorder><Drosophila><Drosophila genus><Drugs><Dysfunction><Encephalon><Endosomes><Flies><Functional disorder><GeneHomolog><Genes><Genetic><Genetic study><Genomics><Goals><HD Gene><HD protein><Homolog><Homologous Gene><Homologue><Human><Human Cell Line><Huntingtin><Huntingtin Protein><Huntington Chorea><Huntington Disease><Huntington gene><Huntington protein><Huntington's><Huntington's Disease><Huntington's disease gene product><Huntingtons Disease><IT15 gene><In Vitro><Integrins><Integrins Extracellular Matrix><Investigation><Investigators><KO mice><Knock-out><Knock-out Mice><Knockout><Knockout Mice><Knowledge><Lead><Learning><Link><Lysosomes><Mammalian Cell><Mediating><Mediator><Medication><Membrane><Mentors><Mice><Mice Mammals><Model System><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><Molecular Interaction><Molecular Target><Murine><Mus><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Cell><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neuraxis><Neurocyte><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neurons><Null Mouse><Organism><Organoids><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Pathogenesis><Pathogenicity><Pathway interactions><Pb element><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phase><Phenocopy><Phenotype><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiopathology><Poly Q><Postdoc><Postdoctoral Fellow><Primary Parkinsonism><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Process><R-Series Research Projects><R01 Mechanism><R01 Program><RNA interference screen><RNAi screen><RNAi-based screen><Receptosomes><Recycling><Regulation><Research><Research Associate><Research Grants><Research Personnel><Research Project Grants><Research Projects><Research Resources><Research Training><Researchers><Resources><Role><Societies><Structure><Subcellular Process><System><Task Forces><Testing><Therapeutic><Thinking><Training><Transmission><aberrant folded protein><aberrant folded proteins><abnormal folded protein><abnormal folded proteins><advisory team><age associated neurodegeneration><age associated neurodegenerative disease><age associated neurodegenerative disorder><age dependent neurodegeneration><age dependent neurodegenerative condition><age dependent neurodegenerative disease><age dependent neurodegenerative disorder><age related neurodegeneration><age-driven neurodegenerative disorders><age-related neurodegenerative disease><age-related neurodegenerative disorder><aging associated neurodegeneration><aging associated neurodegenerative disease><aging related neurodegeneration><aging related neurodegenerative disease><aging related neurodegenerative disorder><autosomal dominant mutation><autosome><conditional knock-out><conditional knockout><creativity><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><developmental><disease model><disorder model><drug/agent><effective therapy><effective treatment><experience><fly><frontier><fruit fly><gain of function><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><hiPSC><human iPS><human iPSC><human induced pluripotent cell><human induced pluripotent stem cells><human inducible stem cells><in vivo><induced human pluripotent stem cells><innovate><innovation><innovative><interesting transcript 15><late endosome><living system><loss of function><membrane structure><misfolded protein><misfolded proteins><model organism><natural aging><neurodegenerative illness><neuron toxicity><neuronal><neuronal toxicity><neurotoxicity><new technology><normal aging><normative aging><novel><novel technologies><pathophysiology><pathway><polyQ><polyglutamine><post-doc><post-doctoral><post-doctoral trainee><primary degenerative dementia><programs><proteotoxic protein><proteotoxin><recruit><research associates><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><skills><social role><superresolution imaging><therapeutic target><therapeutically effective><thoughts><trafficking><translational opportunities><translational potential><transmission process>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Brain Disorders; Dementia; Genetics; Huntington's Disease; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases
Utilizing Bioprinted Human Stem Cells for Molecular Screening via Multi-Material Strategies,Utilizing Bioprinted Human Stem Cells for Molecular Screening via Multi-Material Strategies,"Abstract
Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, are fundamentally characterized
by neuronal damage and cell death. Development of adult and pluripotent stem cells for cellular therapies or
therapeutic screening platforms may enable and accelerate novel treatment options for neuronal diseases.
However, ensuring the precise differentiation of stem cells into functional neurons within 3D culture environments
presents a significant challenge. To overcome this hurdle, this project aims to create novel bioprinting
methodologies for the production of human stem cell-based organoids by developing novel functionally-
optimized bioinks and optimized hydrogel formulations for pharmacological screens. Aim 1 focuses on
developing a customized bioink, which includes water, biopolymers, ions, and cells, to optimize biochemical
activity and mechanobiological responses. This endeavor aims to create a brain-like matrix under 100 μL using
a multi-material approach involving proteins, polysaccharides, and functionalized nanoparticles. The goal is to
reproducibly produce 3D constructs that reduce the variabilities introduced from under-defined commercial
sources. For this research, the bioink formulation incorporates gelatin, collagen, crosslinking enzymes,
photoinitiators, silica nanoparticles, neuron-inducing chemicals, and human stem cells. This formulation aims to
foster the emergence of functional neurons 2-4 weeks after the 3D bioprinting process. Aim 2 focuses on the
high-throughput (HT) assessment of neurotoxic chemicals' effects on the differentiation process of 3D hydrogel-
encapsulated neural stem cells. Utilizing commercial hydrogels for initial tests, this research will explore chemical
differentiation processes and evaluate the influence of neurotoxic chemicals on neuronal differentiation.
Characterization efforts will involve high-throughput imaging analysis methods plus flow cytometry that will allow
drawing correlations among bioink components and differentiation potentials. By comparing the outcomes with
those obtained using custom bioink formulations (from Aim 1) vs. commercial products such as Matrigel and
Geltrex, this project aims to identify a new bioink formulation that has the potential to revolutionize how we

Profiling Upper Aerodigestive Functioning in Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis,Profiling Upper Aerodigestive Functioning in Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Upper aerodigestive functions, including swallowing and airway clearance, are critical for airway protection.
In people with sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM), swallowing impairment, or dysphagia, is recognized
as the primary contributor to early mortality, given its association with aspiration pneumonia. Further, upper
aerodigestive dysfunction is linked to reduced quality of life and substantial economic healthcare burden in
people with IBM. While these poor outcomes are well recognized in the literature, the project team has found
that the mechanism underlying these impairments is poorly understood in IBM and has yet to be well-defined
using well-tested measures. Preliminary data analyzed by the project team has begun to address this issue
by applying the standardized and validated Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile (MBSImP)
approach. Specifically, data of 13 patients with IBM revealed significantly worse and widespread dysfunction
across 11 physiologic swallow components, primarily within the pharyngeal domain, when compared to an
age- and sex-matched healthy cohort. Such efforts need to be further applied to define IBM's gestalt and
nuanced impact on swallowing physiology. Moreover, airway clearance ability has not been investigated
despite it being the first line defense mechanism to aspiration.
Through a cross-sectional design and by leveraging methods that are well-tested in diseases with similar
clinical phenotypes to IBM, the research premise is to uncover IBM’s impact on swallowing physiology
(Aim 1) and airway clearance ability (Aim 2). For Aim 1, the following will be applied: 1) MBSImP for
comprehensive physiologic swallowing analysis across oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal domains; and 2)
selected Analysis of Swallowing Physiology: Events, Kinematics & Timing Method for nuanced
biomechanical measures. Relationships between dysphagia severity and airway clearance ability in
IBM will also be mapped (Aim 2) through links between global dysphagia severity (derived from swallow
safety and efficiency measures), voluntary and reflexive cough function, and respiratory muscle strength.
This project will yield the first and most comprehensive upper aerodigestive profile for IBM to date. By
employing well-tested methods, patient performance will be compared to published normative reference
values to interpret IBM’s impact on upper aerodigestive function. The proposed study will also provide new
insight into the interplay between respiratory-swallowing processes in IBM, which may lead to more timely
dysphagia work-up, improve diagnostic accuracy, and promote the employment of targeted interventions.
This proposal integrates well-tested upper aerodigestive analysis methods, an interdisciplinary team, and a
focused research plan to accelerate the application’s long-term goal: developing best practice clinical
guidelines for managing upper aerodigestive dysfunction in IBM.","<Acceleration><Accuracy of Diagnosis><Address><Age><Area><Aspiration Pneumonia><Barium swallow><Biomechanics><Bolus><Bolus Infusion><Clinical><Clinical Practice Guideline><Coughing><Cross Sectional Analysis><Cross-Sectional Analyses><Cross-Sectional Studies><Cross-Sectional Survey><Data><Defense Mechanisms><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Deglutition><Deglutition Disorders><Diameter><Disease><Disease Frequency Surveys><Disorder><Dysfunction><Dysphagia><Economic Burden><Employment><Esophagus><Event><Face><Functional disorder><Goals><Health><Image><Impairment><Incidence><Inclusion Body Myositis><Individual><Inflammatory><Inflammatory Muscle Diseases><Inflammatory Myopathy><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Invaded><Investigators><Laryngeal><Larynx><Larynx Head and Neck><Life><Link><Literature><Lung><Lung Respiratory System><Maps><Measures><Methods><Modeling><Motor Neuron Disease><Myositis><NHLBI><National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Oral><Outcome><Outcome Measure><PEFR><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Pathogenesis><Pathway interactions><Patients><Peak Expiratory Flow Rate><Performance><Personal Satisfaction><Persons><Pharyngeal structure><Pharynx><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiology><Physiopathology><Position><Positioning Attribute><Predisposition><Premature Mortality><Primary Parkinsonism><Process><Productivity><Progressive Disease><Psychometrics><Publishing><QOL><Quality of life><Reference Ranges><Reference Values><Reflex><Reflex action><Reporting><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Respiratory Muscles><Risk><Safety><Severities><Speed><Sporadic Inclusion Body Myopathy><Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis><Standardization><Survival Rate><Susceptibility><Swallowing><Swallowing Disorders><Testing><Throat><Time><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Training><Upper Esophageal Sphincter><Ventilatory Muscles><Vestibular><Work><accurate diagnostics><adverse consequence><adverse outcome><ages><airway injury><aspirate><biomechanical><clinical phenotype><clinical practice and guidelines><cohort><constriction><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative disorder of motor neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><design><designing><diagnostic accuracy><experience><faces><facial><health care economics><healthcare burden><healthcare economics><imaging><impaired airway><impression><improved><inclusion-body myosytis><injured airway><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><interventional strategy><kinematic model><kinematics><life span><lifespan><measurable outcome><mortality><muscle strength><neurodegenerative illness><novel><outcome measurement><pathophysiology><pathway><pressure><prevent><preventing><psychological defense mechanism><pulmonary><respiratory><respiratory injury><respiratory tract injury><response><sex><skeletal muscle atrophy><skeletal muscle breakdown><skeletal muscle loss><skeletal muscle protein loss><skeletal muscle wasting><skills><sound><systematic review><theories><tongue base><tongue root><vestibular system><voice box><well-being><wellbeing>","Autoimmune Disease; Clinical Research; Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Disease; Digestive Diseases; Lung; Patient Safety; Rare Diseases"
Novel fibril-selective nanobody-based agents targeting intracellular and extracellular α-synuclein aggregates and prion-like propagation induced dementia,Novel fibril-selective nanobody-based agents targeting intracellular and extracellular α-synuclein aggregates and prion-like propagation induced dementia,"Summary
Lewy Body Dementias (LBDs) are a series of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by accumulation of
misfolded α‐synuclein (αS), including Dementia with Lewy Body (DLB), Parkinson’s Disease with Dementia
(PDD), and 1/3 of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). DLB is the 2nd most common dementia after AD accounting for 30%
of dementia cases; approximately 30% of AD cases suffer from α‐synucleinopathy resulting in a more rapid and
severe cognitive decline than AD alone. In brief, αS pathology is highly associated with AD and related dementias
(ADRD). Braak et al. identified that αS pathology spreading as disease progresses from a substantial number of
postmortem studies. Experimental studies have further demonstrated that misfolded αS seeds (i.e., brain
extracts, recombinant αS preformed fibrils (PFF) are prion-like particles that can exponentially propagate
pathology cell-to-cell, tissue-to-tissue, inducing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, driving the disease
progression and causing dementia. These αS seeds can enter cells and induce endogenous αS monomer
misfolding and aggregation, assessed with the immunoreactivity of anti-αS phosphorylated serine 129 (pS129),
a widely used pathological marker. The induced intracellular seeds can be released to extracellular spaces, and
then the extracellular seeds start a new cycle of cell-to-cell transmission. Because intracellular and extracellular
seeds can be easily interconverted, it brings the difficulty to cease cell-to-cell transmission of pathogenic αS. αS
pathology and propagation are observed mainly inside neurons, and αS is more abundant in neurons than in
glial cells, indicating that the intraneuronal αS significantly drives the pathogenesis. There have been
tremendous efforts on the development of antibodies against αS; however, due to the large size and structural
complexity, antibodies have limited penetrability through the plasma membrane. αS antibodies do not enter cells
and are inaccessible to intracellular αS seeds, but only to extracellular αS seeds. Furthermore, antibodies are
usually not functional in the reducing environment of the cytosol due to the reduction of the disulfide bonds,
which are critical for the correct folding of antibodies. In addition, antibody treatment could be costly and
inconvenient in long-term disease progression. It is hypothesized that blockage of intracellular αS propagation
could be effective against cell-to-cell αS transmission, and all these gaps indicate an urgent need to generate a
reagent targeting the intracellular pathogenic αS. In this application, we aim to develop novel nanobody-based
agents that can targeting these pathogenic αS to block cell-to-cell transmission.",<20S Catalytic Proteasome><20S Core Proteasome><20S Proteasome><20S Proteosome><AD dementia><AD related

Reducing falls with Varenicline in Hypocholinergic Parkinson disease,Reducing falls with Varenicline in Hypocholinergic Parkinson disease,"Falls are a major problem for people with Parkinson disease (PD). Falls and their sequelae are the leading cause of hospitalizations, precipitate institutionalization, and increase mortality in PD. No available therapy markedly mitigates fall risk and fall reduction is a major unmet therapeutic need in PD. A considerable body of clinical and preclinical research links fall risk, impaired cognition, particularly impaired attentional function, and brain cholinergic deficits in PD. Approximately two thirds of people with PD at a moderate stage have cortical cholinergic deficits detectable in vivo with [18F]FEOBV positron emission tomography (PET). In broad terms, cholinergic projection system impairments correlate with mild cognitive features in PD and gait impairments, but cholinergic therapeutic development has been hampered to date by the non-specific effects of currently available cholinesterase inhibitors and clinical trial designs that failed to target biologically and functionally relevant outcomes in participants at greatest risk. Preclinical research suggests that stimulation of α4β2 nicotinic cholinergic receptors would enhance attention and diminish fall risk. We performed a successful target engagement study of the α4β2 nicotinic agonist varenicline (VCN; Chantix) in PET confirmed hypo cholinergic PD participants. VCN treatment was well tolerated, had high α4β2 receptor occupancy, and produced relevant physiologic effects on gait and attention including reduced dual tasking cost during normal pace (npDTC) walking. We propose a single-site phase II trial in PD participants with Mild Cognitive Impairment (PD-MCI) to address a rigorous go/no-go rule determining if a multi-center large scale efficacy trial is justified. PD-MCI participants will be screened with [18F]FEOBV PET at the time of enrollment and only hypo cholinergic subjects will be randomized. In a double-masked, parallel-group trial of VCN vs placebo in PD-MCI participants, our primary endpoint will be the durability of VCN’s effect on relevant gait-attentional dual tasking performance. An important secondary endpoint will be 1 year fall reduction in the range of the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID). We will explore the effect of the randomized varenicline intervention on a novel hierarchical composite endpoint of fall-related injuries, falls, and near-falls over 12 months as a future potential endpoint for fall intervention trials in PD. If our hypotheses are verified, we will have critical evidence to justify a multicenter phase III efficacy trial of VCN for fall risk mitigation in PD. Even with a negative outcome, we will introduce and test novel methods for future clinical trials aimed at fall risk mitigation in PD.",<ACh Receptors><Abnormal gait><Acetylcholine><Acetylcholine Receptors><Address><Agonist><Anticholinesterase Agents><Anticholinesterase Drugs><Anticholinesterases><Attention><Base Ratios><Biological><Biostatistical Methods><Blinded><Brain><Brain Nervous System><CNS Nervous System><Care Givers><Caregivers><Central Nervous System><Chantix><Chemicals><Cholinergic Receptors><Cholinesterase Inhibitors><Cholinoceptive Sites><Cholinoceptors><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Clinical Trials><Clinical Trials Design><Cognitive><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive deficits><Cognitive function abnormal><Cross-Over Studies><Crossover Studies><Data><Disabling><Disturbance in cognition><Dose><Double-Blind Method><Double-Blind Study><Double-Blinded><Double-Masked Method><Double-Masked Study><Drug usage><Drugs><Dysfunction><Encephalon><Enrollment><Experimental Models><FDA approved><Fall prevention><Fracture><Frequencies><Functional disorder><Future><Gait><Gait Analysis><Gait abnormality><Gait disorder><Gait disturbances><Gait dysfunction><Gait impairment><Goals><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Impaired cognition><Impairment><Institutionalization><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Intervention Trial><Interventional trial><Investigators><Knowledge><Link><Masks><Medication><Methods><Modeling><Neuraxis><Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors><Nicotinic Agonists><Nicotinic Cholinergic Agonists><Nicotinic Receptors><Outcome><Outcome Measure><PET><PET Scan><PET imaging><PETSCAN><PETT><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Participant><Performance><Persons><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phase><Physiatric Procedure><Physical Medicine Procedure><Physical Therapeutics><Physical therapy><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiopathology><Physiotherapy><Placebos><Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging><Positron Emission Tomography Scan><Positron-Emission Tomography><Posture><Prevention trial><Primary Parkinsonism><Provider><Publishing><Rad.-PET><Randomization trial><Randomized><Receptor Protein><Relative Risks><Research Personnel><Researchers><Risk><Sham Treatment><Site><Specificity><System><Task Performances><Testing><Therapeutic><Time><Walking><Walking impairment><balance disorder><balance impairment><biologic><bone fracture><cholinergic><clinical relevance><clinically relevant><cognitive defects><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive loss><cost><dementia risk><disturbed balance><drug use><drug/agent><effective therapy><effective treatment><efficacy trial><enroll><equilibration disorder><equilibrium disorder><experience><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><fall injury><fall related injury><fall risk><falls><functional disability><gait examination><high risk><improved><in vivo><injurious falls><interventional strategy><measurable outcome><mild cognitive disorder><mild cognitive impairment><mortality><multi-task><multitask><novel><outcome measurement><pathophysiology><pharmacologic><phase 2 trial><phase II trial><positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging><positron emission tomographic imaging><positron emitting tomography><pre-clinical research><preclinical research><preventing falls><primary end point><primary endpoint><primary outcome><prospective test><randomisation><randomization><randomized trial><randomly assigned><receptor><risk factor for dementia><risk for dementia><risk mitigation><secondary end point><secondary endpoint><sham therapy><therapeutic agent development><therapeutic development><trait><trial enrollment><varenicline>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Dementia; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease; Physical Injury - Accidents and Adverse Effects; Prevention; Rehabilitation
Theta burst subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation for cognitive and motor improvements in Parkinson's Disease,Theta burst subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation for cognitive and motor improvements in Parkinson's Disease,"Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease. In particular, Parkinson’s Disease (PD) progression has been associated with LBD and cognitive decline in a number of cognitive domains including executive function, attention, processing speed, episodic memory, and visuospatial processing. The predominant clinical motor features of PD are bradykinesia, resting tremor, and muscular rigidity; however, the prevalence and severity of the nonmotor effects of PD have significant detrimental effects on quality of life. While conventional pharmacological and surgical treatments of PD are effective in improving motor symptoms of PD, they do not improve cognitive deficits and may even have long-term deleterious effects on verbal fluency and cognition. 
Chronic high frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) is efficacious for improving motor symptoms of PD. Current stimulation parameters are optimized for motor benefit, with frequencies in the high gamma (100-180 Hz) range. Interestingly, increased low frequency oscillations (i.e. theta rhythms (4-8 Hz)) have been implicated in a range of cognitive functions, including spatial and episodic learning and memory. There is growing evidence that low (theta) frequency STN stimulation preferentially improves executive function compared to standard-of-care gamma DBS (cDBS). Indeed, we have generated data in PD patients with STN DBS that indicate “on” theta stimulation improves hippocampal-based verbal fluency compared to “off” or “on” gamma stimulation. Unfortunately, low frequency (theta or beta; 5-30 Hz) stimulation is not beneficial for motor symptoms. However, recent advances in stimulation programming allows for theta burst stimulation, which integrates high frequency (gamma 50-200 Hz; trains of 5-25) bursts of stimulation repeated at theta (5-10 Hz) frequency intervals. This theta burst stimulation increases theta oscillation activity. Moreover, there is evidence that STN theta burst stimulation is not only safe, but also has comparable motor outcomes compared to conventional gamma frequency STN DBS. 
Overall Goal: In light of our recent findings that theta stimulation improves cognitive function in PD patients with STN DBS, we hypothesize that chronic theta burst stimulation will confer a long-term cognitive benefit while concomitantly maintaining the motor benefits of gamma stimulation. The proposed randomized double-blind phase 2 clinical trial will focus on determining if 1) short-term and 2) chronic theta burst STN stimulation will improve both cognitive and motor measures; and 3) determining if theta-burst DBS and cDBS result in differing acute and chronic functional brain connectivity. The interpretation of data from this research will improve understanding of the acute and chronic effects of theta burst DBS on cognition and motor function. If successful, this study has the potential to develop a novel STN stimulation paradigm to treat both motor and cognitive PD symptoms as well as understand the effects of theta burst DBS compared to gamma DBS on fMRI functional connectivity measures. As this study is aimed at modulating cognitive networks, the ultimate goal is to develop novel stimulation parameters to treat chronic cognitive dysfunction in PD dementia and more broadly Lewy body dementia. Moreover, data collected, and collaborations developed will lay the foundation for a definitive Phase 3 clinical trial utilizing theta-burst stimulation for cognition and motor symptom improvement.",<AD dementia><Acute><Affect><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><Amentia><Ammon Horn><Attention><Bradykinesia><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Caring><Chronic><Clinical><Cognition><Cognitive><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive Manifestations><Cognitive Symptoms><Cognitive decline><Cognitive deficits><Cognitive function abnormal><Collaborations><Conflict><Conflict (Psychology)><Cornu Ammonis><Cross-Over Designs><Crossover Design><Data><Data Analyses><Data Analysis><Deep Brain Stimulation><Dementia><Disease Progression><Disturbance in cognition><Double-Blind Method><Double-Blind Study><Double-Blinded><Double-Masked Method><Double-Masked Study><Dyskinesia Syndromes><Encephalon><Episodic memory><Executive Dysfunction><Executive Function Deficit><Executive Impairment><Foundations><Frequencies><Functional MRI><Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Globus Pallidus><Goals><Hippocampus><Human><Immediate Memory><Impaired cognition><Impairment><Implant><Individual><LB dementia><Learning><Lewy Body Dementia><Lewy Body Type Senile Dementia><Lewy dementia><Light><MDS-UPDRS><MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale><Measures><Memory><Modern Man><Motor><Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale><Movement Disorder Syndromes><Movement Disorders><Muscle Rigidity><Muscular Rigidity><Nerve Degeneration><Neurobehavioral Manifestations><Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms><Neuron Degeneration><Nucleus Subthalamicus><Operative Procedures><Operative Surgical Procedures><Outcome><PD with dementia><Paralysis Agitans><Parietal><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Parkinson Disease dementia><Parkinson's Dementia><Parkinson's disease with dementia><Patients><Phase><Phase 2 Clinical Trials><Phase 3 Clinical Trials><Phase II Clinical Trials><Phase III Clinical Trials><Photoradiation><Pilot Projects><Prevalence><Primary Parkinsonism><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><QOL><Quality of life><Randomized><Research><Rest><Rest Tremor><STN stimulation><Safety><Severities><Short-Term Memory><Shortterm Memory><Structure of subthalamic nucleus><Subthalamic Nucleus><Surgical><Surgical Interventions><Surgical Procedure><Symptoms><Task Performances><Testing><Theta Rhythm><Time><Training><UPDRS><Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale><Visuospatial><Work><arm><cognitive benefits><cognitive decline in Parkinson's><cognitive defects><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's><cognitive function><cognitive impairment in Parkinson's><cognitive loss><cognitive task><data interpretation><dementia in PD><dementia in Parkinson disease><effective therapy><effective treatment><executive control><executive function><fMRI><fMRI scan><functional MRI scan><functional magnetic resonance imaging scan><hippocampal><implantation><impression><improve symptom><improved><motor symptom><neural degeneration><neurobehavioral symptom><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neurological degeneration><neuronal degeneration><non-motor symptom><nonmotor symptom><novel><pallidum><pharmacologic><phase II protocol><phase III protocol><pilot study><primary degenerative dementia><primary outcome><processing speed><randomisation><randomization><randomly assigned><response><selective attention><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><standard of care><subthalamic nucleus stimulation><surgery><symptom improvement><symptomatic improvement><verbal><visual spatial><working memory>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD); Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Assistive Technology; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Bioengineering; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Dementia; Lewy Body Dementia; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease; Rehabilitation
SCH: AI-empowered wearable multimodal sensors (AI-MEDALLION) for noninvasive monitoring,SCH: AI-empowered wearable multimodal sensors (AI-MEDALLION) for noninvasive monitoring,"Over the last decade, significant progress has been made in wearable sensors that detect biomarkers in a
continuous and non-invasive manner from biofluids such as sweat. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the
 second-most common neurodegenerative disorder in the United States, and early diagnosis and
management of the disease course of PD remains an urgent task. Among all biomarker types, the sweat
 metabolites, peptides, and anions can reflect both the phenotypic states of cells or organs and their
 dynamic responses to external stimuli, such as drug treatment. However, significant technical challenges
exist in developing sweat metabolic biomarkers and wearable sweat sensors in PD monitoring: 1) lack of
 known biomarkers and accurate whole metabolomic and peptide profiles in PD patients' sweat; 2) the
 selected biomarkers need to be optimized for PD system and sensor technology; 3) current wearable
sweat sensors fall short in sensitivity. This project aims to fill these gaps by proposing a novel framework
for predicting and optimizing the PD metabolic biomarkers using large-scale multi-omics data, to innovate
 non-invasive wearable sweat sensor with high sensitivity and specificity. Specifically, the biomarker
 panels and sweat sensor will be developed by bridging state-of-the-art AI and nanotechnologies to assist
the diagnosis and monitoring of PD, and will be validated clinically. The proposed research will provide an
 integrative infrastructure for developing novel PD biomarkers and non-invasive personal wearable
 devices. We will develop computational methods to solve a set of unaddressed questions in biomarker
 discovery, namely identification of PD-specific functional variations, prediction of metabolites and peptides
 in body fluids, and optimization of biomarker selection for personal wearable sensor (Aim 1). We will gain
 fundamental knowledge and technical capabilities in designing, processing, and optimizing of 2D
materials-based wearable sensors for versatile applications. A physics-based, data-driven protocol will be
 developed to reveal the fundamental process-structure-property-performance relation for wearable
sensors (Aim 2). We will develop new biomarker sets and wearable sweat sensors and test the

Development of EP2 Receptor Antagonist to Treat Alzheimer's Disease,Development of EP2 Receptor Antagonist to Treat Alzheimer's Disease,"Lay Summary
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. Currently, about 6.5 million
Americans are living with AD. Alzheimer’s and other dementias are estimated to cost the US $321 billion per
year and this number is expected to 1 trillion by 2050, yet no small molecule therapeutic agent on the horizon
that clearly alters the disease progression and inevitable cognitive decline. The small molecule drugs and
anti-bodies that have been developed based on the amyloid cascade hypothesis showed a limited (if any)
disease modifying benefit so far. Thus, it would be very important to validate novel drug targets and small
molecules that work through a novel mechanism of action for future AD therapy. Neuroinflammation is
recognized as a key phenotype in the AD brain that is associated with the development of dementia.
Prostaglandin-E2 receptor EP2, which acts downstream of complex signaling by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
appears as a key driver of neuroinflammation. Activation of this receptor further induces COX-2 creating a
vicious reactive cycle in the brain. We have recently developed a suite of small-molecule antagonists for this
receptor and derived a proof-of-concept in 5xFAD mouse models demonstrating antagonism of EP2
attenuates neuroinflammation and the amyloid load in the brain. Moreover, we have validated that EP2
receptor antagonism is associated with cognition sparing benefits in acute brain injury models of status
epilepticus and a peripheral inflammatory sepsis model. We have identified several preclinical lead
candidates for development into a clinical lead and candidate drug to mitigate neuroinflammation and
cognitive deficits in Alzheimer’s patients. We now propose to define PK/PD relations of the lead EP2
antagonists on Alzheimer’s pathology markers in the brain and determine PK/PD relation on the AD relevant
biomarkers in the blood (plasma), CSF and the brain tissue in two different mouse (5xFAD and APPSAA)
models that that display features of early-onset of AD (EOAD) and late-onset of AD (LOAD) in human.
Furthermore, we proposed to conduct drug development studies to determine therapeutic index and NOAEL
for the lead EP2 antagonist and complete all other IND-enabling studies required by the FDA. Our overall
goal is to achieve a disease modifying efficacy by the EP2 drug that delays the progression of Alzheimer’s
dementia at least by 5 years. We envision that targeting EP2, a specific prostanoid receptor downstream of
COX-2, rather than a generic block of the entire COX-2 signaling is a superior therapeutic strategy for AD
that will bypass the adverse cardiovascular events found with chronic dosing of COX-2 drugs.","<(TNF)-α><AD dementia><AD model><AD pathology><Acute><Acute Brain Injuries><Age Months><Alzheimer Type

Developing an Anti-proteotoxicity Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases,Developing an Anti-proteotoxicity Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Project Summary
Protein quality control is a fundamental system in the cell that is important for normal cellular
functions and defense against potential pathogenic insults. Protein misfolding and aggregation
are a central feature of many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The complexity of
neurodegeneration calls for large-scale unbiased screening studies. Over the past few years,
we have made breakthrough observations that have significant implications for the
understanding of cellular defense systems against proteotoxicity. Using a unique blend of
biochemical, genetic, and cell biological approaches, we discovered a novel pathway to
reprogram protein quality control, and with new genetic hits related to this pathway. Our work
has elucidated a previously unrecognized network in protein quality control. The studies on this
network could expand our understanding of proteotoxic-stress-responsive quality control
systems in the cell, beyond the well-established heat shock response or unfolded protein
response. The findings will suggest new strategies for harnessing the cellular defense system
to prevent and treat the relevant forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with
proteotoxicity. Our project will be focused on investigating novel molecular targets that are
identified through unbiased screens and testing new small molecule compounds that have
been designed to be specific inhibitors of this target. We predict that the advances gained
through our research efforts will eventually lead to new therapeutic interventions to address the
relevant neurodegenerative diseases.",<AD dementia><ALS therapy><ALS treatment><Address><Airway failure><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer

Endolysosomal Proteome Landscapes Through the Lens of Neurodegenerative Risk Alleles,Endolysosomal Proteome Landscapes Through the Lens of Neurodegenerative Risk Alleles,"The endolysosomal/Golgi system provides routes for degradation or recycling of plasma membrane (PM) proteins via endocytosis and degradation of cytosolic proteins/organelles via autophagy. Much evidence supports the idea that endolysosomal system dysfunction underlies a variety of neurodegenerative conditions, ranging from Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) to Parkinson’s diseases. Among the proteins encoded by genetic drivers of AD/ADRD are core components of the endolysosomal system itself (e.g. BIN1, PSEN1/2, GRN, CHMP2B) and proteins whose endolysosomal trafficking is disrupted in the context of genetic disease (APP/Ab, SORL1, Tau aggregates). In addition, the expression of endolysosomal retrograde trafficking regulators such as the Retromer subunit VPS35 are reduced during aging, thereby promoting aberrant accumulation of toxic Ab species. Nevertheless, how individual risk alleles alter trafficking and degradation pathways within the network and whether diverse alleles converge on a common set of phenotypic outcomes remains unclear. This reflects, in part, the absence of a framework for understanding the key protein assemblies within the endolysosomal system that are subject to altered regulation in the context of risk alleles. Building on our previous work defining organelle quality control systems in iNeurons principally through autophagy, we now seek to re-imagine our understanding of the architecture of the endolysosomal system through the generation of “organellar structural proteome landscapes” within the system and through interrogation of how these networks are altered in the context of neurodegenerative disease risk alleles (including VPS35). Our approach merges organelle isolation with crosslink proteomics to identify interacting protein pairs and couples this with Alphafold Multimer to generate pairwise and higher order structural predictions across organellar proteomes. This approach, which overcomes several limitations of conventional methods for identifying protein interactions within the context of membrane-bound organelles, has already allowed us to generate structural predictions for hundreds of endosomal and Golgi protein complexes, including complexes that control chloride ion balance or lipid composition within endolysosomes – key drivers of organelle homeostasis. We propose to: 1) complete and disseminate an integrated structural proteome landscape resource (EndoLysMAPV1) in the HEK293 cell system (Aim 1), 2) generate the first of its kind EndoLysMAPV2 in iNeurons, which we have demonstrated express a dramatically different plasma membrane proteome including numerous dynamic synaptic proteins (Aim 2), and 3) create analogous maps in iNeurons harboring risk allele variants, including VPS35D620N and LRRK2G2019S, which dramatically alters the PM proteome based on our proteomics analysis (Aim 2). To demonstrate the value of our approach to reveal new biology, Aim 3 will mechanistically dissect new and validated transmembrane protein interactions with endolysosomal membrane embedded transporters that likely contribute directly to endolysosomal function and identity.",<AD dementia><AD related dementia><ADRD><APF-1><APP processing><ATP-Dependent Proteolysis Factor

Mechanisms of mitochondrial genome integrity in familial and idiopathic Parkinson's disease,Mechanisms of mitochondrial genome integrity in familial and idiopathic Parkinson's disease,"ABSTRACT
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and over ten million
people worldwide are living with PD. To date, treatments are only symptomatic; they do not alter the inexorable
progression of the disease. The most common cause of familial and idiopathic PD are mutations in leucine-rich
repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD demonstrate mitochondrial impairment, however
our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD is limited. In our efforts to
understand the underlying mechanisms driving mitochondrial dysfunction, we found that mitochondrial DNA
damage is a shared phenotype amongst both LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD. Unrepaired mitochondrial
DNA damage can have major adverse cellular effects, impacting genetic and protein instability, compromising
bioenergetic function, increasing reactive oxygen species, and triggering cell death. Recent preliminary studies
by the Sanders lab has found that blocking kinase activity of ATM (a kinase that functions to sense, signal and
promote repair of DNA damage) rescues PD-induced mitochondrial DNA damage. We further observed that
ATM is activated and initiates the DNA damage response pathway. Interestingly, mitochondrial DNA repair
capacity is impaired with a concomitant increase in specific mitochondrial oxidative DNA lesions. Our central
hypothesis is that dysfunctional LRRK2 triggers the ATM-mediated DNA damage response pathway, which
impairs mitochondrial DNA repair capacity, leading to an increase in mitochondrial DNA damage, ultimately
promoting downstream pathogenic PD cascades. We will test this hypothesis with three specific aims that
integrate molecular, biochemical and cellular techniques using established neuronal and murine PD models. Aim
1 will determine the molecular nature of the mitochondrial DNA damage and the dependency on LRRK2 kinase
activity. Aim 2 will define the cellular mechanism(s) by which mitochondrial DNA damage accumulates in PD.
Aim 3 will determine the contribution of ATM to PD-associated phenotypes. This project will advance our

Probing Biomolecular Condensates in Live Cells using Microsecond-scale Single Molecule Rotational Diffusion Microscopy (µs-SiMRoD),Probing Biomolecular Condensates in Live Cells using Microsecond-scale Single Molecule Rotational Diffusion Microscopy (µs-SiMRoD),"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The crowded conditions within cells present a complex physicochemical challenge for maintaining the
solubility and fluidity of thousands of distinct macromolecules. High macromolecular densities promote assembly
into a variety of distinct structures, which in turn can lead to the formation of insoluble solid aggregates. Though
solidified structures could indeed serve protective purposes or as quiescent storage sites, they are more
generally considered to be toxic to the cell. The physical constraints and properties generated by crowded cellular
environments, which contribute significantly to the functional behaviors of the resident molecules, are often
difficult to probe experimentally. In addition to membrane-bound compartments, which define the primary
structural organization of cells, numerous membraneless organelles (MLOs) populate the cytoplasm and the
nucleoplasm providing additional complexity. These biomolecular condensates (BMCs) form via liquid-liquid
phase separation (LLPS), a process that concentrates the resident macromolecules, but which in turn also can
promote additional phase states, including solid aggregates. Multiple BMC-resident proteins that undergo LLPS
in vitro are the dominant proteins in cytoplasmic inclusions found in patients with a range of devastating
neurological disorders. In one such example, the fused in sarcoma (FUS) protein accumulates in MLOs termed
stress granules (SGs), which form as a natural response to various cellular stress conditions. The high molecular
density of FUS in SGs is potentially an essential early step toward the formation of FUS-containing solid
inclusions linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Directly observing
the formation and growth of such inclusions within a cellular context is challenged by the lack of appropriate
tools. While genetic approaches to attach fluorescent tags are commonly used to determine spatiotemporal
behaviors, their attachment can often perturb function, there are generally only a few reasonable attachment
points, and such probes have inferior photophysical properties. Recent improvements in genetic code expansion
to incorporate non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) for in cellulo labeling promises to significantly extend the types
of questions that may be addressed. This is particularly relevant for the application of multiple single molecule
biophysical strategies. The Specific Aim of the proposed work is to identify and characterize solid aggregates
within live cells. To accomplish this, designer MLOs will be used to specifically modify FUS via ncAA-mediated
fluorescent labeling in cells. Microsecond-scale single molecule rotational diffusion (µs-SiMRoD) microscopy will
then be used to probe for local environmental constraints such as increased viscosity or structural confinement.
The target application will be identifying and monitoring solidified FUS-containing aggregates. This strategy is
expected to be instrumental for identifying unknown pathways leading to the formation of solid aggregates, and
thus, it will likely provide new leads into disease onset. The developed methods are expected to be broadly
useful for probing the physical properties of numerous BMCs within cells.",<2-dimensional><AD dementia><Active Follow-up><Address><Agreement><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><Amber><Amino Acids><Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis><Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Motor Neuron Disease><Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal degeneration><Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia><Automobile Driving><Behavior><Binding><Biological><Biophysics><Catalogs><Cell Body><Cells><Cellular Stress><Cellular Stress Response><Characteristics><Chemicals><Chronic><Codon><Codon Nucleotides><Coloring Agents><Complex><Crowding><Cytoplasm><Cytoplasmic Inclusion><Data Bases><Databases><Diffusion><Disease><Disorder><Dyes><Dysfunction><Environment><Equipment and supply inventories><Eukaryotic Cell><FTD/ALS><FTLD/ALS><Fluorescence><Fluorescence Agents><Fluorescence Light Microscopy><Fluorescence Microscopy><Fluorescent Agents><Fluorescent Dyes><Frontal Temporal Dementia><Frontotemporal Dementia><Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration/Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis><Functional disorder><Gehrig's Disease><Generalized Growth><Genes><Genetic Code><Growth><Heterogeneity><In Vitro><Individual><Inferior><Inventory><Label><Link><Liquid substance><Location><Lou Gehrig Disease><Mediating><Membrane><Messenger RNA><Methods><Microscopy><Molecular><Molecular Interaction><Monitor><Nature><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neurologic Disorders><Neurological Disorders><Non-Polyadenylated RNA><Nucleoplasm><Onset of illness><Organelles><Outcome><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Pathway interactions><Patients><Phase><Physical condensation><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiology><Physiopathology><Primary Parkinsonism><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Process><Property><Proteins><Proteome><RNA><RNA Gene Products><Reporting><Ribonucleic Acid><Role><Scanning><Site><Solid><Solubility><Stop Codon><Structure><Surface><System><Techniques><Technology><Termination Codon><Terminator Codon><Tissue Growth><Transfer RNA><Translating><Translation Stop Signal><Triplet Codon-Amino Acid Adaptor><Viscosity><Work><active followup><aminoacid><amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia><amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/FTLD><amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia><amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/ftd><barriers to implementation><biologic><biophysical foundation><biophysical principles><biophysical sciences><catalog><cell stress><condensation><data base><density><design><designing><diffused><diffuses><diffusing><diffusions><disease onset><disorder onset><driving><fluid><fluidity><fluorescent dye/probe><fluorophore><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><front temporal dementia><frontal lobe dementia><frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis><frontotemporal lobar dementia><frontotemporal lobar dementia amyotrophic lateral sclerosis><frontotemporal lobe degeneration associated with dementia><fused in sarcoma><genetic approach><genetic strategy><implementation barriers><implementation challenges><improved><in vivo><interest><liquid><mRNA><macromolecular assembly><macromolecule><membrane structure><nano meter scale><nano meter sized><nanometer scale><nanometer sized><nanoscale><neurological disease><novel><ontogeny><pathophysiology><pathway><physical property><primary degenerative dementia><primary outcome><response><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><single molecule><social role><spatiotemporal><stress granule><tRNA><tool><transfer Ribonucleic acids><two-dimensional>,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS); Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Complementary and Integrative Health; Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases
Examination of the Role of Executive Function during Reading and Math in Children,Examination of the Role of Executive Function during Reading and Math in Children,"Project Summary Abstract
 Children’s reading and math skills are critical to their future educational outcomes, career readiness, and
overall health and well-being (e.g., ACT, 2020; Cain & Oakhill, 2006; DeWalt et al., 2004; Geary, 2011;
Heilmann, 2020; Krajewski & Schneider, 2009; Ritchie & Bates, 2013), yet many children struggle with math
and learning to read (National Center for Education Statistics, 2020). Individuals who struggle with math or
learning to read often display weaknesses in executive function (EF) skills on behavioral measures (Peng &
Fuchs, 2014), which could underline one of the fundamental bases of their deficits in reading and math.
Conversely, individuals who struggle with reading or math may need to recruit additional EF skills to
compensate for their poor reading and math problem-solving to meet task demands (Martinez-Lincoln et al., in
review). By understanding the association between EF and domain-specific academic skills, we will have
greater insight into the development of reading and math, and how EF can hinder or facilitate academic
growth. This proposal aims to examine the recruitment of domain-general vs. domain-specific EF (Aim 1) and
the connectivity for domain-specific and EF brain regions (Aim 2) in 7-8 yo children. After EF recruitment and
connectivity have been established, behavioral correlates that influence EF connectivity to domain-specific
regions will be examined in a larger group of children, over-sampled for reading and math difficulty (Aim 3), to
facilitate a greater understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms of learning and how EF may vary by
reading and math skill level.
 This proposal integrates behavioral and neuroimaging approaches, to fulfill the candidate’s short-term
goals to distinguish the recruitment and connectivity of EF in reading and math for children and the behavioral
correlates that influence EF brain activity and connectivity to understand development. These findings will
support her long-term goals to use these complementary methodologies to develop effective interventions for
struggling learners and to identify how the recruitment of EF may differ across development. The proposed
training plan will provide skills necessary to have a successful, independent research career in academia by
enhancing the candidate’s research program, while also expanding her research skills in four key areas: (1) a
greater understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms of reading and math, (2) advanced
computational and statistical approaches to neuroimaging data, (3) scholarly productivity in educational
neuroscience, and (4) professional development. The candidate’s career and training plan will take place at
Vanderbilt’s University (VU), a consistent recipient of funding from the National Institutes of Health. VU has a
top-ranking Special Education Program with one of the few educational neuroscience programs and has
substantial resources to provide support to the candidate during the K99 phase of the award.",<0-11 years old><4th grade><Academia><Academic skills><Area><Attention><Award><Behavioral><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Brain imaging><Brain region><Child><Child Development><Child Youth><Children (0-21)><Church><Cognitive><Compensation><Complex><Data><Development><Education><Educational aspects><Encephalon><Evidence based intervention><Exhibits><Functional MRI><Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Funding><Future><Generalized Growth><Goals><Growth><Health><Imaging Procedures><Imaging Technics><Imaging Techniques><Immediate Memory><Individual><Individual Differences><Infant and Child Development><Knowledge><Language><Learning><Learning Disabilities><Learning disability><Link><Math><Mathematics><Meta-Analysis><Methodology><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Neurobiology><Neurosciences><Outcome><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Personal Satisfaction><Phase><Play><Primary Parkinsonism><Problem Solving><Process><Productivity><Reader><Reading><Research><Research Resources><Resources><Risk><Role><Sampling><Short-Term Memory><Shortterm Memory><Special Education><Techniques><Tissue Growth><Training><United States National Institutes of Health><Universities><base><bases><behavior measurement><behavioral measure><behavioral measurement><brain visualization><career><career preparation><career readiness><co-morbid><co-morbidity><cognitive process><comorbidity><design><designing><developmental><effective intervention><executive control><executive function><fMRI><flexibility><flexible><fourth grade><improved><insight><job readiness><kids><math ability><math achievement><math competence><math competency><math deficiencies><math deficts><math difficulties><math proficiency><mathematic ability><mathematic achievement><mathematic compentence><mathematic compentency><mathematic proficiency><mathematical ability><mathematical achievement><mathematical compentence><mathematical compentency><mathematical deficiencies><mathematical deficit><mathematical difficulties><mathematical proficiency><mathematics difficulties><neural imaging><neuro-imaging><neurobiological><neurobiological mechanism><neuroimaging><neurological imaging><number sense><numeracy><ontogeny><phonology><proficient in math><programs><quantitative literacy><reading ability><reading achievement><reading competence><reading deficiency><reading deficit><reading difficulties><reading proficiency><recruit><remedial/special education><remediation><skill acquisition><skill development><skills><social role><statistics><well-being><wellbeing><work readiness><workforce readiness><working memory><workplace readiness><youngster>,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Biomedical Imaging; Clinical Research; Mental Health; Neurosciences; Pediatric
CSF Oligomeric α-synuclein targeted nano scavengers as a Parkinson's disease theranostic,CSF Oligomeric α-synuclein targeted nano scavengers as a Parkinson's disease theranostic,"Project Summary
The pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and related synucleinopathies such as dementia with Lewy bodies are
characterized by progressive deposition Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites composed primarily of phosphorylated alpha-
synuclein aggregates (α-syn), neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier compromise, and neurodegeneration. Currently, there
are no clinically approved biomarker diagnostic tools or disease modifying treatments for PD. Clinical diagnosis is based
on a combination of motor and nonmotor symptoms, but the neurodegeneration process may precede the first appearance
of these symptoms by decades. Empirical data suggests that levels of oligomeric α-syn in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of
PD patients surpass those of normal individuals by several orders of magnitude. Oligomeric α-syn and reactive gliosis are
strongly implicated in the initiation and spread of the disease. Recent data from clinical trials with anti-amyloid-β (anti-Aβ)
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), (despite lack of clarity in the full safety/efficacy profile),
suggest that anti-Aβ mAbs statistically improved cognitive and biomarker outcomes, demonstrating that neurodegenerative
amyloidosis disorders can be slowed or halted. Over the past decade, we have demonstrated in several mouse models of
neurodegeneration that following tail vein injection, liposomes bearing an imaging contrast payload cross the BBB into the
CSF, primarily at the blood-CSF barrier at the at the choroid plexus and cerebrovascular leaks and bind to specific targets
within the brain, enabling separation of disease mice from controls using noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
or computed tomography imaging. Our lead product is currently in clinical trials as the first MRI-based imaging agents for
Aβ plaques in AD. In a recent proposal funded by the NIA (R21 AG067131), we hypothesized that a variant of our agent
labeled with oligomeric α-syn ligands will act as a scavenger for the pathologic species resulting in the formation of cross-
linked agglomerates of the agent and pathologic species making them more suitable substrates for rapid phagocytosis (sizes
> 0.5 microns) by activated glia. This in turn can lead to momentary accumulation of detectable levels of the agent in PD
positive brains enabling noninvasive separation of test subjects from controls. Our preliminary data demonstrates successful
in vitro formation of agglomerates upon exposure of the agent to α-syn fibrils and accelerated uptake of the ensuing
agglomerates by microglia and neuroblastoma cell lines. In vivo administration by tail vein injection followed by MRI
showed statistically significant signal enhancement in the brains of transgenic mice versus controls. The in vivo data was
verified by ex-vivo immunohistochemical analysis which showed a correlation between in vivo MRI signal, regional
distribution of the agent in brain tissue, Lewy pathology, and microglia activity. In this application, we seek to capitalize on
this data and our experience in the area to fully establish the preclinical potential of our nano scavenger concept both as
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for PD. Specifically, we propose to test the efficacy of the agent to profile/halt disease
progression from the prodromal stage through early to late stages in the M83 α-syn transgenic mouse line. The in vivo data
will be validated with ex vivo histology analysis and behavioral studies. Furthermore, we propose to establish more insights
on the cellular mechanisms involved in uptake and degradation of the biomarker using both murine and human cell lines.","<AD dementia><AD model><ATRA><Acceleration><Alpha-Synuclein transgenic

Non-Contrast-Enhanced MRI for Brain Perfusion Mapping of Lewy Body Dementia,Non-Contrast-Enhanced MRI for Brain Perfusion Mapping of Lewy Body Dementia,"Project Abstract
 Cognitive impairment is a significant non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). At least 75% of
PD patients surviving for more than 10 years will develop Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) and the
incidence rate of dementia in PD is 4-6 times of the general population. PDD and dementia with Lewy bodies
(DLB), jointly known as Lewy body dementia (LBD), are both caused by abnormal deposits of proteins in the
brain called Lewy bodies, and account for 4-10% of all dementia patients. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is
considered an important biomarker for neurodegeneration. There remains an urgent unmet need to establish
reliable and practical neuroimaging biomarkers related to cognitive functions to describe both the spatial and
temporal progression of LBD. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a completely noninvasive method for measuring
CBF and is ideal for frequent non-invasive longitudinal monitoring. ASL methods typically apply spatially
selective inversion modules to supply arteries distant from imaging volumes, which is known to render
underestimation of CBF due to transit time delay, especially among elderly subjects. Velocity-selective
arterial spin labeling (VSASL) was proposed to remove the time-delay artifact. Our group has implemented the
first velocity-selective inversion (VSI) based VSASL with 3D segmented GRASE acquisition and
demonstrated its higher sensitivity to perfusion signal over conventional ASL methods. Furthermore, our
preliminary data showed that VSASL with 3D single-shot stack-of-spiral-based turbo FLASH acquisition
delivered better perfusion image quality with fewer artifacts than using segmented GRASE, and high temporal
resolution potentially allowing adequate retrospective motion correction. The overarching goal is to test the
hypothesis that the VSASL-based CBF pattern is a reliable biomarker for LBD that predicts long-term cognitive
impairment and dementia outcomes: Aim 1, we will conduct further technical developments for 3D VSASL with
accelerated acquisitions and improved immunity to head motion; Aim 2, we will assess VSASL’s between-
session reproducibility and its reliability to detect regional changes in CBF related to movement tasks and the
dopaminergic medication; Aim 3, we will investigate VSASL’s sensitivity to early cognitive impairment in patients
leading to LBD through both cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons. These studies are to ensure the
optimized VSASL MRI technique with high reproducibility, reliability, and sensitivity to detect early changes in
brain perfusion that are correlated with cognitive impairment and dementia in patients leading to LBD.","<3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><Acceleration><Amentia><Arteries><Artifacts><Biological Markers><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cerebrovascular Circulation><Cerebrum><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Cognitive><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Contrast Agent><Contrast Drugs><Contrast Media><Data><Dementia><Dementia with Lewy Bodies><Deposit><Deposition><Development><Disadvantaged><Disease><Disorder><Distant><Disturbance in cognition><Drugs><Early Diagnosis><Elderly><Encephalon><Ensure><Fingers><General Population><General Public><Goals><Head><Head Movements><Image><Immunity><Impaired cognition><Incidence><Individual><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigation><L-Dopa><LB dementia><Levodopa><Lewy Bodies><Lewy Body Dementia><Lewy Body Type Senile Dementia><Lewy dementia><MR Imaging><MR Tomography><MRI><MRI biomarker><MRI marker><MRIs><Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Maps><Measures><Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance><Medication><Methods><Monitor><Morphologic artifacts><Motion><Movement><Multi-center clinical study><Multi-site clinical study><Multicenter clinical study><Multisite clinical study><NMR Imaging><NMR Tomography><Nerve Degeneration><Neuron Degeneration><Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Occipital lobe><Oral Administration><Oral Drug Administration><Outcome><PD with dementia><PET><PET Scan><PET imaging><PETSCAN><PETT><Paralysis Agitans><Parietal><Parietal Lobe><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Parkinson Disease dementia><Parkinson's Dementia><Parkinson's disease with dementia><Patients><Pattern><Perfusion><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging><Positron Emission Tomography Scan><Positron-Emission Tomography><Primary Parkinsonism><Proteins><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Rad.-PET><Radiopaque Media><Recommendation><Reproducibility><Research><SPECT><SPECT imaging><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Single-Photon Emission-Computed Radionuclide Tomography><Standardization><Techniques><Temporal Lobe><Testing><Time><Vendor><Zeugmatography><advanced age><arterial spin labeling><arterial spin tagging><bio-markers><biologic marker><biological signal transduction><biomarker><blood flow in brain><blood perfusion><body movement><brain blood circulation><brain blood flow><cerebral><cerebral blood flow><cerebral circulation><cerebrocirculation><cerebrovascular blood flow><clinical applicability><clinical application><cognitive assessment><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive function><cognitive loss><cognitive testing><cost><dementia in PD><dementia in Parkinson disease><detection sensitivity><developmental><drug/agent><early detection><evaluation/testing><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><geriatric><healthy volunteer><hemodynamics><hypoperfusion><imaging><imaging biomarker><imaging marker><imaging-based biological marker><imaging-based biomarker><imaging-based marker><improved><intraoral drug delivery><intravenous injection><magnetic resonance imaging biomarker><magnetic resonance imaging marker><mild cognitive disorder><mild cognitive impairment><neural degeneration><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neuroimaging biomarker><neuroimaging marker><neurological degeneration><neuronal degeneration><non-motor symptom><nonmotor symptom><occipital cortex><parietal cortex><perfusion imaging><positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging><positron emission tomographic imaging><positron emitting tomography><reconstruction><response><senior citizen><side effect><single photon emission computed tomography><temporal cortex><temporal measurement><temporal resolution><three dimensional><time measurement>",Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD); Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Biomedical Imaging; Brain Disorders; Cerebrovascular; Clinical Research; Dementia; Lewy Body Dementia; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease; Vascular Contributions to Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID)
Towards a comprehensive understanding of the neurotoxic spread of α-synuclein from gut to brain in Parkinson's disease,Towards a comprehensive understanding of the neurotoxic spread of α-synuclein from gut to brain in Parkinson's disease,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder for which disease-modifying therapies
do not currently exist and the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. PD is characterized by
the loss of dopaminergic and other neuronal cell types, and the formation of pathological Lewy body inclusions
containing aggregated α-synuclein protein. Increasing evidence suggests that α-synuclein aggregation may
originate in neurons innervating the gastrointestinal tract, and spread to the central nervous system in a prion-
like manner. While rodent models have demonstrated that gut-to-brain spreading of α-synuclein can occur and
results in neurodegeneration and behavioral decline, major challenges associated with the low-throughput nature
of these model systems have hindered progress in the field. To address these issues and significantly accelerate
the rate of discovery of novel disease mechanisms, we propose to generate new gut-to-brain α-synuclein
transmission models in C. elegans, a rapidly aging and highly genetically tractable model organism amenable to
large-scale investigations. We will construct and integrate brain-wide maps of spreading α-synuclein pathology
and neurodegeneration, revealing vulnerable and resilient neuronal cell types in the face of α-synuclein insult
from the gut. To decipher cell type-specific mechanisms that underlie these differential susceptibilities, we will
use a combination of high-throughput screening and single cell RNA-sequencing. Known and predicted cell
surface proteins will be systematically tested for a potential role as novel α-synuclein receptors, facilitating the
toxic invasion of α-synuclein into neurons. Nervous system-wide, single cell transcriptional analyses will provide
powerful insights into both protective and detrimental factors responsible for the fate of neurons in the path of
gut-to-brain α-synuclein transmission. Collectively, this work will constitute the most comprehensive investigation
to date of the mechanisms regulating α-synuclein neurotoxic propagation from the gut, linking cellular- and
molecular-level events at unprecedented resolution, with neuronal degeneration and whole-organism behavioral
dysfunction. Given the accessibility of the human gut to pharmacological and dietary interventions, the results of
this study may inform early therapeutic strategies that hold great promise to halt or even prevent PD progression.",<Acceleration><Address><Aging><Alimentary Canal><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Behavioral><Biologic Models><Biological Models><Brain><Brain Diseases><Brain Disorders><Brain Nervous System><C elegans><C. elegans><C.elegans><CNS Nervous System><Caenorhabditis elegans><Cell Body><Cell Surface Proteins><Cells><Cellular Inclusions><Central Nervous System><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Dietary Intervention><Digestive Tract><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Dysfunction><Encephalon><Encephalon Diseases><Event><Functional disorder><GI Tract><Gastrointestinal Tract><Gastrointestinal tract structure><Gene Transcription><Genetic Transcription><High Throughput Assay><Human><Inclusion Bodies><Intracranial CNS Disorders><Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders><Invaded><Investigation><Lewy Bodies><Link><Maps><Model System><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><NAC precursor><Nature><Nematoda><Nematodes><Nerve Cells><Nerve Degeneration><Nerve Unit><Nervous System><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Cell><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neuraxis><Neurocyte><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Body System><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neurologic Organ System><Neuron Degeneration><Neurons><Nutrition Interventions><Nutritional Interventions><PARK1 protein><PARK4 protein><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Pathologic><Pathology><Physiopathology><Predisposition><Primary Parkinsonism><Proteins><RNA Expression><Receptor Protein><Resolution><Rodent Model><Role><SNCA><SNCA protein><Susceptibility><Testing><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Intervention><Transcription><Transmission><Whole Organism><Work><a-syn><a-synuclein><age associated neurodegeneration><age associated neurodegenerative disease><age associated neurodegenerative disorder><age dependent neurodegeneration><age dependent neurodegenerative condition><age dependent neurodegenerative disease><age dependent neurodegenerative disorder><age related neurodegeneration><age-driven neurodegenerative disorders><age-related neurodegenerative disease><age-related neurodegenerative disorder><aging associated neurodegeneration><aging associated neurodegenerative disease><aging related neurodegeneration><aging related neurodegenerative disease><aging related neurodegenerative disorder><alimentary tract><alpha synuclein><alpha synuclein gene><alphaSP22><asyn><cell type><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><diet intervention><digestive canal><disease model><disorder model><high throughput screening><insight><intervention therapy><model of animal><model organism><neural degeneration><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neurodegenerative illness><neurological degeneration><neuronal><neuronal degeneration><neurotoxic><non A-beta component of AD amyloid><non A4 component of amyloid precursor><novel><pathophysiology><pharmacologic><prevent><preventing><prion-like><receptor><resilience><resilient><resolutions><roundworm><scRNA-seq><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single-cell RNA sequencing><social role><transmission process><α synuclein gene><α-syn><α-synuclein>,Aging; Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease
"Rapireon, a new macrocycle molecular glue that selectively activates the nuclease activity of IRE1","Rapireon, a new macrocycle molecular glue that selectively activates the nuclease activity of IRE1","The unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway plays an essential role in health and
diseases from cancer to neurodegeneration. Of the three UPR pathway branches, the
IRE1-XBP1 pathway is the most highly conserved in comparison with the PERK and
ATF6 pathways. It has been shown that selective genetic activation of XBP1 in the IRE1
pathway is effective in multiple neurodegenerative disorders from Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) to Parkinson’s disease (PD). Using an XBP1-driven luciferase reporter system, we
screened a library of newly designed macrocycles called rapafucins that are modeled after
the immunosuppressive and anticancer drug rapamycin and identified an activator of
XBP1 named Rapireon. Further characterization of Rapireon revealed that it acts as a
molecule glue by recruiting FKBP12 to form a ternary complex with the cytosolic
domain of IRE1. Moreover, the FKBP12-Rapireon complex was found to selectively
activate the nuclease activity of IRE1 without affecting its kinase activity. In this
application, we propose to carry out in-depth characterization of the mode of action of
Rapireon using both biochemical and structural biology approaches. In preliminary
studies, we already obtained a low-resolution cryo-EM structural model of the FKBP12-
Rapireon-IRE1 ternary complex. We will continue to collect more data and refine the the
structure to better than 2.5 Å resolution. In parallel, we will build on our existing high-
resolution (below 2 Å) FKBP12-Rapireon binary complex x-ray crystal structure and
attempt to obtain the crystal structure of the ternary complex. To improve the potency
and specificity of the existing Rapireon lead, we will design and synthesize a DNA-
encoded library (DEL) of Rapireon analogs and develop a solution-phase proximity
ligation/deep sequencing platform to identify new analogs of Rapireon from the DEL.
Once a potent lead compound is identified, we will attempt to improve the
pharmacokinetic property and bioavailability of Rapireon through structural optimization
of Raprieon, giving rise to a Rapireon analog that can serve as a tool compound for
exploring its potential in treating neurodegenerative diseases.",<AD dementia><AD model><ATF6><ATF6 gene><Activating Transcription Factor 6><Affect><Agonist><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimer's disease model><Alzheimers Dementia><Anti-Cancer Agents><Antineoplastic Agents><Antineoplastic Drugs><Antineoplastics><Bioavailability><Biochemical><Biological Availability><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cancer Drug><Cancers><Cell model><Cellular Assay><Cellular model><Closure by Ligation><Complex><Cryo-electron Microscopy><Cryoelectron Microscopy><Crystallization><DNA><Data><Data Collection><Data Set><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Deoxyribonucleic Acid><Disease><Disorder><Drug Kinetics><Electron Cryomicroscopy><Encephalon><Evaluation><FK-506-Binding Protein><FK506 Binding Proteins><FK506-Binding Protein 1><FK506-Binding Protein 1A><FKBP><FKBP Rotamase><FKBP-12><FKBP12><Future><Genetic><Glues><Goals><Health><In Vitro><Investigation><Kinases><Lead><Learning><Libraries><Ligation><Luciferase Immunologic><Luciferases><Macrophilin-12><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Modeling><Molecular><Names><Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents><Nerve Degeneration><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neuron Degeneration><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Pathway interactions><Pb element><Penetration><Pharmacokinetics><Phase><Phosphotransferase Gene><Phosphotransferases><Physiologic Availability><Play><Primary Parkinsonism><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Property><Proteins><RNA Nucleases><RNA Splicing><RNase><Rapamune><Rapamycin><Reporter><Resolution><Ribonuclease Family Protein><Ribonucleases><Roentgen Rays><Role><Signal Pathway><Single Crystal Diffraction><Sirolimus><Specificity><Splicing><Structural Models><Structure><System><Tacrolimus Binding Protein 1A><Tacrolimus Binding Proteins><Transphosphorylases><Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents><X Ray Crystallographies><X-Radiation><X-Ray Crystallography><X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography><X-Ray Radiation><X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography><X-ray><XBP1><XBP1 gene><Xray><Xray Crystallography><alzheimer model><analog><anti-cancer drug><cell assay><cryo-EM><cryoEM><cryogenic electron microscopy><deep sequencing><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><design><designing><disease model><disorder model><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><improved><in vivo><inhibitor><iterative design><lead optimization><malignancy><name><named><naming><neoplasm/cancer><neural degeneration><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neurodegenerative illness><neurological degeneration><neuronal degeneration><novel><novel lead compound><nuclease><pathway><pharmacologic><primary degenerative dementia><rational design><recruit><resolutions><response><screening><screenings><selective expression><selectively expressed><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><sequencing platform><social role><stoichiometry><structural biology><tool><transgene expression>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD); Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Dementia; Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences
Unraveling the Role of Clonal Hematopoiesis in Neurodegenerative Diseases,Unraveling the Role of Clonal Hematopoiesis in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"ABSTRACT
Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) has been linked to an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. However,
its potential implications in various age-related conditions, particularly neurodegenerative diseases, remain
insufficiently explored. Recent research has highlighted the protective effect of clonal hematopoiesis of
indeterminate potential (CHIP) against Alzheimer's disease (AD), emphasizing the need for further investigation
into CH's role across a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, the involvement of CH in other
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal lobar degeneration (ALS/FTD), has not been comprehensively
investigated. Additionally, the distinct implications of other types of CH, including autosomal mosaic
chromosomal alteration (mCA) and loss of the Y chromosome (LOY), on these diseases have yet to be
thoroughly examined. To fill this knowledge gap, this project will unravel the disentanglement of commonalities
and disparities in associations between different CH types and neurodegenerative diseases by leverage a large
amount of high-throughput sequencing data of AD, PD, DLB, and ALT/FTD. Moreover, this project will gain
insight into the underlying mechanisms of its potential varying effects of CH across the diseases by utilizing
extensive functional genomics data. To this end, this project has three specific aims. In aim 1, we will uncover
the associations of different CH types with neurodegenerative diseases by leveraging whole-genome sequencing
data from multiple cohorts. We will also perform Mendelian randomization to support causal associations
between CH and neurodegenerative diseases. In aim 2, we will characterize inter-individual transcriptomic
variability in individuals with and without CH across central nervous system tissues and myeloid cells by
leveraging previously published data, including bulk, sorted, and single-nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), as well as
assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), from disease cohorts. We will also
perform cell type-specific transcriptome and chromatin accessibility characterization by detecting cells with
autosomal mCA and LOY from snRNA-seq/ ATAC-seq. In aim 3, we will employ two innovative experimental
approaches: (1) snRNA-seq paired with genotyping of transcriptome (GoT) and (2) iPSC-derived human
microglia-like cells (iMGL) to delve into the cell type-specific functional impacts of CHIP. Aim 3 will significantly
complement Aim2 since cell type-specific characterization of CHIP is challenging unlike autosomal mCA and
LOY. Our preliminary results suggest varying effects of CHIP and LOY on the risk of different neurodegenerative
diseases and functional impact of LOY, especially highlighted in microglia. These findings validate and motivate
our work plan, driving us to pursue further studies in this project. The comprehensive understanding of CH's role
in neurodegenerative diseases achieved through this project will make significant contributions to the discovery
of novel treatment options and the discovery of biomarkers for predicting the risk or progression of these diseases.",<AD dementia><ATAC sequencing><ATAC-seq><ATACseq><Aberrant Chromosome><Alzheimer

"Relationships between immunosenescence, brain aging biomarkers, and cognition across nonhuman primate species of differing lifespans","Relationships between immunosenescence, brain aging biomarkers, and cognition across nonhuman primate species of differing lifespans","Project Summary
The world’s population is aging, which brings about huge scientific challenges. Since the biological process of
aging is by far the greatest risk factor for most chronic diseases, understanding the molecular and cellular
mechanisms by which aging leads to these conditions is of vital importance to increase the health span of older
adults. Aging results in several structural and functional changes in the immune system and is clinically
associated with increases in the frequency and severity of infectious diseases and incidences of cancer,
chronic in inflammatory disorders, and autoimmunity. This general dysregulation in immune system function is
referred to as immunesenescence. Immunosenescence is a multifactorial and dynamic complex phenomenon,
which is shown as a lengthy adjusting and remodeled process existing in immune system during lifespan.
However, the mechanisms under-lying age-associated dysregulated immunity are still incompletely
understood. This proposal investigates a new perspective on immune cell markers and function with age
across NHP species with differing lifespans. In addition, we will examine the relationship between immune
aging and neurodegenerative biomarkers and cognition and compare these relationships across the NHP
species. These studies will help determine the role the immune system plays in longevity, neurodegeneration
and cognitive decline, which may allow researchers to develop and test immuno-restorative approaches with
the goal of improving longevity in humans.","<(TNF)-α><AD pathology><APO-1><Adaptive Immune System><Adipose tissue><Age><Age of Onset><Aging><Alzheimer beta-Protein><Alzheimer's Amyloid

Mechanisms of mitochondrial genome integrity in familial and idiopathic Parkinson's disease,Mechanisms of mitochondrial genome integrity in familial and idiopathic Parkinson's disease,"ABSTRACT
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and over ten million
people worldwide are living with PD. To date, treatments are only symptomatic; they do not alter the inexorable
progression of the disease. The most common cause of familial and idiopathic PD are mutations in leucine-rich
repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD demonstrate mitochondrial impairment, however
our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD is limited. In our efforts to
understand the underlying mechanisms driving mitochondrial dysfunction, we found that mitochondrial DNA
damage is a shared phenotype amongst both LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD. Unrepaired mitochondrial
DNA damage can have major adverse cellular effects, impacting genetic and protein instability, compromising
bioenergetic function, increasing reactive oxygen species, and triggering cell death. Recent preliminary studies
by the Sanders lab has found that blocking kinase activity of ATM (a kinase that functions to sense, signal and
promote repair of DNA damage) rescues PD-induced mitochondrial DNA damage. We further observed that
ATM is activated and initiates the DNA damage response pathway. Interestingly, mitochondrial DNA repair
capacity is impaired with a concomitant increase in specific mitochondrial oxidative DNA lesions. Our central
hypothesis is that dysfunctional LRRK2 triggers the ATM-mediated DNA damage response pathway, which
impairs mitochondrial DNA repair capacity, leading to an increase in mitochondrial DNA damage, ultimately
promoting downstream pathogenic PD cascades. We will test this hypothesis with three specific aims that
integrate molecular, biochemical and cellular techniques using established neuronal and murine PD models. Aim
1 will determine the molecular nature of the mitochondrial DNA damage and the dependency on LRRK2 kinase
activity. Aim 2 will define the cellular mechanism(s) by which mitochondrial DNA damage accumulates in PD.
Aim 3 will determine the contribution of ATM to PD-associated phenotypes. This project will advance our

Functional amyloid formation in streptococcus mutans,Functional amyloid formation in streptococcus mutans,"ABSTRACT
Dental caries, the most common microbial disease, is caused by overgrowth of acidogenic and aciduric bacteria
including Streptococcus mutans. Childhood caries incidence in the U.S. is high and there is a clear imperative to
better understand caries pathogenesis. Cariogenic organisms thrive in biofilm environments. Amyloid was
first identified in the context of pathology but does not always represent a protein mis-folding pathway.
Functional amyloid is also recognized. Amyloid aggregates are evolutionarily conserved cross -sheet
quaternary structures with common biophysical properties enabling their detection and study. Multiple
microorganisms are now known to produce functional amyloids within biofilm environments. Our group was
the first to discover Streptococcus mutans amyloids. We have now identified four amyloid-forming proteins in
this bacterium. Three of these, P1 (AgI/II), WapA, and Cnm are sortase-localized adhesins whose extracellular
truncation derivatives are amyloidogenic. The previously unknown fourth protein, Smu_63, serves as a
negative regulator of biofilm cell density and genetic competence. We have provided extensive tertiary and
quaternary structural characterization of adhesin P1 and structural characterization of other proteins is in
progress. We have provided definitive X-ray fiber diffraction evidence of a classical stacked -sheet amyloid
structure for S. mutans amyloids. Furthermore, our work contributes to a new paradigm for multiple
streptococcal and staphylococcal amyloids. Naturally-occurring truncation products play two key roles within
these organisms' biofilm life cycles. First by promoting adherence to cognate ligands in their monomeric
forms via quaternary interactions with the parent adhesins linked to the cell surface, and second by facilitating
detachment of biofilm cells and extracellular matrix components from aging biofilms in their amyloid form.
The left-handed Z-configuration of extracellular DNA within biofilms was recently associated with biofilm
stability whereas right-handed B-DNA disrupted extant biofilms. The amyloid, but not monomeric form of
neuropathologic A, drives conversion of Z-DNA to B-DNA. Cardiolipin-rich mitochondrial membranes
modulate amyloidogeneis of -synuclein and Htt involved in Parkinson's and Huntingtin Diseases. We have
identified cardiolipin as a prevalent lipid in S. mutans cytoplasmic membranes and extracellular membrane
vesicles. In this renewal application we will explore relationships between S. mutans amyloid-forming
proteins and B- and Z-forms of DNA in vitro and in vivo within adherent and detaching biofilms (Aim 1),
determine the impact of membrane lipid composition on S. mutans amyloid formation within aging biofilms
and assess interactions of amyloidogenic proteins with specific lipids of interest (Aim 2), and continue to use
state of the art methods including solution and solid-state NMR to identify and characterize structural
transitions reflective of monomer to amyloid conversion and determine if amyloid signatures for each protein
are impacted by exposure to different DNA configurations, lipids, or other amyloidogenic proteins (Aim 3).",<Adherence><Aging><Amyloid><Amyloid Substance><B Form DNA><B-DNA><Bacteria><Bacterial Adhesins><Behavior><Beta Sheet><Binding><Cardiolipins><Caries><Cell Density><Cell Membrane Lipids><Cell Wall><Cell membrane><Cell surface><Cell-Extracellular Matrix><Cellular Membrane><Childhood><Clinical><Clinical Treatment Moab><Collagen><Coloring Agents><Competence><Cytoplasmic Membrane><DNA><DNA Content><DNA Index><DNA Ploidy><Dental Decay><Dental Plaque><Dental caries><Deoxyribonucleic Acid><Detection><Disease><Disorder><Dyes><ECM><Endocarditis><Environment><Evaluation><Exposure to><Extracellular Matrix><Fiber><Funding><Generalized Growth><Genetic><Genus staphylococcus><Grant><Growth><HD Gene><HD protein><Health Care Costs><Health Costs><Healthcare Costs><Human><Huntingtin><Huntingtin Protein><Huntington gene><Huntington protein><Huntington's disease gene product><IT15 gene><Impact evaluation><In Situ><In Vitro><Incidence><Infection><Infective endocarditis><Laboratories><Left><Left-Handed DNA><Length><Life Cycle><Life Cycle Stages><Ligands><Link><Lipids><Liposomal><Liposomes><Literature><Membrane Lipids><Methodology><Methods><Microbial Biofilms><Modern Man><Molecular Interaction><Monoclonal Antibodies><NAC precursor><Organism><PARK1 protein><PARK4 protein><Paralysis Agitans><Parents><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Pathogenesis><Pathologic><Pathology><Pathway interactions><Peptides><Phosphatides><Phospholipids><Plasma Membrane><Play><Ploidies><Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry><Post-Translational Modifications><Post-Translational Protein Modification><Post-Translational Protein Processing><Posttranslational Modifications><Posttranslational Protein Processing><Primary Parkinsonism><Protein Modification><Proteins><Reporting><Research><Right-Handed DNA><Roentgen Rays><S mutans><S. mutans><SNCA><SNCA protein><SSNMR><Staphylococcus><Streptococcus><Streptococcus mutans><Structure><Tissue Growth><Vesicle><Work><X-Radiation><X-Ray Radiation><X-ray><Xray><Z-DNA><Z-Form DNA><a-syn><a-synuclein><aberrant protein folding><abnormal protein folding><adhesin><alpha synuclein><alpha synuclein gene><alphaSP22><amyloid assembly><amyloid formation><amyloid structure><amyloidogenesis><asyn><beta pleated sheet><biofilm><biophysical characteristics><biophysical characterization><biophysical measurement><biophysical parameters><biophysical properties><brain amyloidogenesis><chromosome complement><cross reactivity><extracellular><in vivo><insoluble aggregate><interest><interesting transcript 15><life course><living system><mAbs><microbial><microbial disease><microorganism><mitochondrial membrane><monoclonal Abs><monomer><neuropathologic><neuropathological><neuropathology><non A-beta component of AD amyloid><non A4 component of amyloid precursor><ontogeny><oral bacteria><oral flora><parent><pathologic protein folding><pathway><pediatric><plasmalemma><polypeptide><prevent><preventing><protein aggregate><protein aggregation><protein misfolding><protein protein interaction><protein purification><solid state NMR><solid state nuclear magnetic resonance><sortase><srtA gene product><synuclein><tooth decay><zDNA><α synuclein gene><α-syn><α-synuclein><β-Sheet><β-pleated sheet>,"Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Disease; Infectious Diseases"
Role of Rab27 Isoforms on Alpha-Synuclein Endocytosis and Clearance,Role of Rab27 Isoforms on Alpha-Synuclein Endocytosis and Clearance,"Synucleinopathies, including Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and Lewy Body Dementias such as Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Parkinson’s Disease Dementia (PDD), are a devastating group of neurodegenerative disorders that cause extensive social and economic burdens worldwide. The prevalence of these diseases is predicted to increase drastically, yet no therapies currently prevent neurodegeneration in PD, PDD, or DLB. Alpha-synuclein (asyn) is the key pathogenic protein that misfolds, aggregates, and induces pathology in PD, PDD, and DLB. Pathogenic asyn spreads from cell to cell throughout the brain, and misfolded asyn species are hypothesized to facilitate the spread of pathology by inducing the misfolding of nonpathogenic species. However, little is known about the exact processes that promote asyn propagation in PD, PDD, and DLB.
The goal of this project is to allow the PI (Kacie Scholz) to develop the necessary skills in neuroscience research to study key proteins involved in asyn pathology. The primary objective of this proposal is to investigate the roles of Rab27a and Rab27b on the endocytosis and autophagic-lysosomal degradation of asyn. Previous work from the lab of Dr. Talene Yacoubian, the PI’s sponsor, has identified that Rab27b is upregulated in temporal cortical lysates from human PD and DLB subjects relative to age-matched controls, and that it acts as a mediator of asyn clearance and toxicity in asyn models. Further, our lab has identified Rab27a as a potential mediator of asyn uptake. Both endocytosis and autophagic-lysosomal clearance are critical components of the spread of asyn and asyn-related pathology. In Aim 1, the PI will examine the role of Rab27b in promoting the lysosomal clearance of asyn using in vitro and in vivo asyn models. In Aim 2, she will examine the impact of Rab27a in mediating asyn endocytosis in in vitro and in vivo asyn models. The long-term goals are to advance our understanding of asyn pathology and to identify new therapeutic targets for potential disease-modifying therapies for PD, PDD, and DLB.
The proposed training plan for Kacie is sponsored by her project sponsor, Dr. Talene Yacoubian. The overall goal is to provide her with a solid foundation for a successful career in academic science. The training plan includes experiences that will help Kacie develop skills in rigorous neuroscience research in synucleinopathies including training in the responsible conduct of research, critical research techniques, data analysis, and the available literature. It will also expose her to invaluable career and professional development opportunities in areas including scientific communication, translational research skills, and grant and manuscript writing. This proposal will drive the development of the skills needed to conduct rigorous scientific research in synuclein disorders and provide an invaluable foundation for the PI’s future career as an academic scientist focused on neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD, PDD, and DLB.",<21+ years old><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Age><Area><Assay><Bilateral><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cell Body><Cell Culture Techniques><Cell Line><Cell model><CellLine><Cells><Cellular model><Clinical><Closure by Ligation><Communication><Corpus Striatum><Corpus striatum structure><Data><Data Analyses><Data Analysis><Defect><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Dementia with Lewy Bodies><Development><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Dopaminergic Cell><Economic Burden><Encephalon><Endocytosis><Exposure to><Foundations><Future><Goals><Grant><Human><Image><In Vitro><Injections><Isoforms><KO mice><Knock-out Mice><Knockout Mice><Knowledge><LB dementia><Lewy Body Dementia><Lewy Body Type Senile Dementia><Lewy dementia><Ligation><Literature><Lysosomes><Manuscripts><Mediating><Mediator><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modeling><Modern Man><Murine><Mus><NAC precursor><Nerve Cells><Nerve Degeneration><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Cell><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurocyte><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neuron Degeneration><Neurons><Neurosciences><Neurosciences Research><Null Mouse><PARK1 protein><PARK4 protein><PD with dementia><Pancreatic beta Cell><Pancreatic β-Cell><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Parkinson Disease dementia><Parkinson's Dementia><Parkinson's disease with dementia><Pathogenicity><Pathology><Pathway interactions><Patients><Prevalence><Primary Parkinsonism><Process><Protein Family><Protein Isoforms><Proteins><Research><Research Technics><Research Techniques><Role><SNCA><SNCA protein><Science><Scientist><Solid><Strains Cell Lines><Striate Body><Striatum><Structure of beta Cell of islet><Substantia Nigra><Substantia nigra structure><Symptoms><Temporal Lobe><Testing><Tissue Harvesting><Toxic effect><Toxicities><Training><Translational Research><Translational Science><Work><Writing><a-syn><a-synuclein><adulthood><ages><alpha synuclein><alpha synuclein gene><alphaSP22><asyn><career><cell culture><cell cultures><cultured cell line><data interpretation><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><dementia in PD><dementia in Parkinson disease><developmental><experience><forging><imaging><in vivo><knock-down><knockdown><member><mouse model><murine model><neural degeneration><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neurodegenerative illness><neurological degeneration><neuronal><neuronal degeneration><new drug target><new drug treatments><new druggable target><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new pharmacotherapy target><new therapeutic target><new therapeutics><new therapy><new therapy target><next generation therapeutics><non A-beta component of AD amyloid><non A4 component of amyloid precursor><novel drug target><novel drug treatments><novel druggable target><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel pharmacotherapy target><novel therapeutic target><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><novel therapy target><overexpress><overexpression><pancreas beta cell><pancreas β cell><pancreatic b-cell><paracrine><pathway><prevent><preventing><rab G-Proteins><rab GTP-Binding Proteins><rab GTPases><responsible research conduct><skill acquisition><skill development><skills><social><social role><striatal><synuclein><synucleinopathy><temporal cortex><therapeutic target><trafficking><translation research><translational investigation><uptake><α synuclein gene><α-syn><α-synuclein>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD); Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Brain Disorders; Dementia; Lewy Body Dementia; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease
Genetic circuits for targeted modulation of neuroinflammation,Genetic circuits for targeted modulation of neuroinflammation,"Project summary/Abstract
Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive functions. Current methods
to study neuroinflammation in animal models are extremely limited, primarily restricted to endpoint histological
analysis. Furthermore, a means to precisely control the neuroinflammatory response is lacking.
The goal of this proposal is to develop the first family of biosensors that can be used to report and dynamically
regulate changes in inflammation within the brains of live animals. This is accomplished by a synthetic gene
circuit where a sensor of dynamic changes in inflammatory cytokines translates these changes into production
of proteins capable of mitigating pathological inflammation. Building on our experience with bioluminescent
optogenetics tools, we will develop a light emitting Bioluminescent Kinase Sensor (BlinKS) that activates a light
sensing transcription factor driving cytokines to reduce inflammation. Our first aim is to develop and optimize
sensors based on split luciferases that will produce light in the presence of a molecule produced in the
inflammatory signaling cascade. Inflammation dependent light production is then leveraged to activate light
sensitive optogenetic proteins to control cellular activity. Our second aim is to utilize these light emitting sensors
of the inflammatory cascade in a genetic circuit to control the expression of an anti-inflammatory cytokine to
control inflammation as a self-regulating therapeutic in a transgenic mouse model of neuroinflammation. Our end
goal is to apply these inflammation modulators to various animal models where neuroinflammation is a key
pathologic hallmark such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. We expect
these modulators to have high translational potential to combat neurodegeneration and other inflammatory
disorders.
This project is enabled by a multidisciplinary team of five labs with expertise in high throughput screening
methodologies for biosensor engineering, optogenetics, genetic circuits, high throughput single-cell sequencing
and gene expression analysis, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and in vivo applications. We anticipate
that these new biosensors and modulators will be transformative tools for both neuroscience and immunology
research and be a powerful therapeutic by enabling noninvasive imaging of inflammatory responses and
selective, inflammation-dependent immunomodulation with cell type specificity that can be used in deep brain
structures, across large areas, in behaving animals.",<AD dementia><Acids><Affinity><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer

Untangling the influence of distinct sources of somatosensory feedback on the neural dynamics of dexterous movement control,Untangling the influence of distinct sources of somatosensory feedback on the neural dynamics of dexterous movement control,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 To move successfully, we must be able to sense our bodies and our environment. This is no more evident
than when participants attempt to strike a match to light a candle after their hand’s somatosensation has been
numbed. Despite being able to see well, participants fumble with the match and clumsily attempt to accomplish
the task. Further, somatosensory-motor integration is notably impaired in many types of neurological movement
disorders including Parkinson’s disease, stroke, essential tremor, and dystonia. Developing rehabilitation or
therapeutic strategies to improve somatosensory-motor integration faces a central challenge: while the
theoretical importance of somatosensory-motor integration (SMI) is clear, how the brain actually processes
afferent signals to enable excellent movement control remains unclear.
 In this proposal, we seek to use a population neural dynamics framework to understand how the brain
implements SMI computations. Specifically, we will leverage a novel feedback-dependent dexterous
manipulation task, high-density multi-area recordings, and an innovative type of electrical stimulation that can
be used to modulate inter-area communication in the macaque monkey. These combined experiments and
analysis are designed to uncover how SMI computations, long known to be critical for movement control, are
implemented in population neural activity patterns in brain. Further, they will pave the way for developing
approaches for restoring damaged SMI in the brain after brain injury or neurodegenerative disease.
 The main experimental approach of this proposal includes simultaneous high-density, high channel-count
(Neuropixel) electrophysiological recordings from the primary motor cortex (M1), primary somatosensory cortex
(S1), and cerebellar-receiving motor thalamus (mThal) in non-human primates that are learning and executing a
dexterous manipulation task. The main analytical approach includes modeling the timeseries of motor cortical
population activity as a combination of intrinsic motor cortical dynamics and inputs from S1 and mThal. The
hypothesis of this proposal is that S1 and mThal exert different influences on M1 population dynamics throughout
the learning and execution process. Specifically, we hypothesize that S1 provides specific sensory updates that
drive M1 population activity, and mThal modulates the temporal dynamics of M1 population activity. We will
further develop evidence for or against this hypothesis by leveraging a novel neuromodulation approach that can
boost or interrupt communication between distant brain regions. Completion of this proposal will constitute an
understanding of how SMI computations, that have long been thought to be essential for movement, are actually
implemented in the circuitry and population dynamics of the macaque sensorimotor system. This advance would
improve our understanding of how to target somatosensory nodes to improve control of movement following
motor impairment.",<Acquired brain injury><Apoplexy><Area><Benign Essential Tremor><Brain><Brain Injuries><Brain Nervous System><Brain Vascular Accident><Brain region><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cerebral Stroke><Cerebrovascular Apoplexy><Cerebrovascular Stroke><Communication><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Distant><Dyskinesia Syndromes><Dystonia><E-stim><Electric Stimulation><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Encephalon><Environment><Essential Tremor><Face><Feedback><Hand><Impairment><Interruption><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Learning><Light><Loss of Sensation><Macaca><Macaque><Maps><Medical Rehabilitation><Modeling><Monitor><Monkeys><Motor><Motor Cortex><Movement><Movement Disorder Syndromes><Movement Disorders><Muscle Dystonia><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neurological><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Numbness><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Participant><Pattern><Photoradiation><Population><Population Dynamics><Primary Parkinsonism><Process><Rehabilitation><Rehabilitation therapy><Sensory><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Somatosensory Cortex><Source><Stroke><Thalamic structure><Thalamus><Therapeutic><Update><Work><biological signal transduction><body movement><brain attack><brain damage><brain-injured><cerebral vascular accident><cerebrovascular accident><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><density><design><designing><electrophysiological><electrostimulation><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><faces><facial><hands><improved><innovate><innovation><innovative><motor impairment><movement impairment><movement limitation><neural><neural control><neural regulation><neurodegenerative illness><neuromodulation><neuromodulatory><neuroregulation><non-human primate><nonhuman primate><novel><rehab therapy><rehabilitative><rehabilitative therapy><sensorimotor system><sensory motor system><somatosensory><somesthetic sensory cortex><stroked><strokes><thalamic>,Brain Disorders; Neurosciences
Mechanisms of mitochondrial genome integrity in familial and idiopathic Parkinson's disease,Mechanisms of mitochondrial genome integrity in familial and idiopathic Parkinson's disease,"ABSTRACT
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and over ten million
people worldwide are living with PD. To date, treatments are only symptomatic; they do not alter the inexorable
progression of the disease. The most common cause of familial and idiopathic PD are mutations in leucine-rich
repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD demonstrate mitochondrial impairment, however
our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD is limited. In our efforts to
understand the underlying mechanisms driving mitochondrial dysfunction, we found that mitochondrial DNA
damage is a shared phenotype amongst both LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD. Unrepaired mitochondrial
DNA damage can have major adverse cellular effects, impacting genetic and protein instability, compromising
bioenergetic function, increasing reactive oxygen species, and triggering cell death. Recent preliminary studies
by the Sanders lab has found that blocking kinase activity of ATM (a kinase that functions to sense, signal and
promote repair of DNA damage) rescues PD-induced mitochondrial DNA damage. We further observed that
ATM is activated and initiates the DNA damage response pathway. Interestingly, mitochondrial DNA repair
capacity is impaired with a concomitant increase in specific mitochondrial oxidative DNA lesions. Our central
hypothesis is that dysfunctional LRRK2 triggers the ATM-mediated DNA damage response pathway, which
impairs mitochondrial DNA repair capacity, leading to an increase in mitochondrial DNA damage, ultimately
promoting downstream pathogenic PD cascades. We will test this hypothesis with three specific aims that
integrate molecular, biochemical and cellular techniques using established neuronal and murine PD models. Aim
1 will determine the molecular nature of the mitochondrial DNA damage and the dependency on LRRK2 kinase
activity. Aim 2 will define the cellular mechanism(s) by which mitochondrial DNA damage accumulates in PD.
Aim 3 will determine the contribution of ATM to PD-associated phenotypes. This project will advance our

Peripheral Tissue Biomarker for Premortem Diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia,Peripheral Tissue Biomarker for Premortem Diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia,"Abstract
The overall goal of our project is to validate a diagnostic tool for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and
Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD), two common neurodegenerative diseases affecting 1.4 million people in
the U.S. Currently, definitive diagnosis of DLB and PDD often requires the postmortem detection of disease-
associated alpha-synuclein (αSynD) aggregates in the brain. Clinically, DLB and PDD can be easily
misdiagnosed with other dementias and parkinsonisms such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and tauopathies. An
unmet medical need is to identify biomarkers for early and differential diagnosis of DLB and PDD in more easily
accessible tissues. We have taken advantage of the emerging technology known as the real-time quaking
induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay to develop a robust platform for ultrasensitive detection of αSynD in
peripheral tissues. In preliminary studies, we are able to detect prion-like seeding activity of αSynD in the skin of
DLB and PD patients with 100% specificity and sensitivity. In addition, we were remarkably successful in
detecting αSynD seeding activity in multiple peripheral tissues including skin, sigmoid colon, and submandibular
glands in autopsied specimens. We hypothesize that RT-QuIC of peripheral αSynD is a highly sensitive and
robust diagnostic biomarker for premortem diagnoses of DLB and PDD. To test this hypothesis, we propose
to pursue the following four Aims: (1) Establish peripheral αSynD as a biomarker for postmortem diagnosis of
DLB and PDD using RT-QuIC assay; (2) Assess skin αSynD as a biomarker for premortem diagnosis of DLB and
PDD; (3) Determine peripheral αSynD and tau as a biomarker for differentiating DLB and PDD from other
dementias and parkinsonisms such as AD and tauopathies; (4) Explore gut αSynD as a biomarker for premortem
diagnosis of DLB and PDD using colon biopsy. Successful implementation of this proposal will establish RT-
QuIC assay utilization for early diagnosis of DLB and PDD using readily available peripheral specimens.","<AD dementia><Active Follow-up><Affect><Age><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><Amentia><Assay><Autopsy><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Biological Markers><Biopsy><Biopsy Sample><Biopsy Specimen><Body Tissues><Brain><Brain Nervous System><CNS Nervous System><Cadaver><Caring><Central Nervous System><Cerebrospinal Fluid><Clinical><Clinical Trials><Colon><Colonoscopy><Corticodentatonigral degeneration with neuronal achromasia><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Dementia><Dementia with Lewy Bodies><Deposit><Deposition><Dermatologic biopsy><Detection><Diagnosis><Diagnostic tests><Differential Diagnosis><Disease><Disorder><Dysfunction><Early Diagnosis><Emergent Technologies><Emerging Technologies><Encephalon><Enteric Nervous System><Functional disorder><Goals><Hypersensitivity skin testing><Immunochemical Immunologic><Immunologic><Immunological><Immunologically><Immunologics><LB dementia><Lewy Body Dementia><Lewy Body Type Senile Dementia><Lewy dementia><Lumbar Puncture><MT-bound tau><Measures><Medical><Methods><NAC precursor><Nasal><Nasal Passages Nose><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neuraxis><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neurologic Disorders><Neurological Disorders><Nose><PARK1 protein><PARK4 protein><PD with dementia><Parkinson Disease dementia><Parkinson's Dementia><Parkinson's disease with dementia><Parkinsonian><Parkinsonian Condition><Parkinsonian Diseases><Parkinsonian Disorders><Parkinsonian Syndrome><Parkinsonism><Patient Care><Patient Care Delivery><Patient Recruitments><Patients><Peripheral><Persons><Physiopathology><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Proctosigmoidoscopy><Progressive Supranuclear Ophthalmoplegia><Progressive Supranuclear Palsy><Reporting><Research Specimen><Respiratory System, Nose, Nasal Passages><SNCA><SNCA protein><Salivary Glands><Salivary Glands Head and Neck><Sampling><Sensitivity and Specificity><Severity of illness><Sigmoid><Sigmoid colon><Sigmoidoscopy><Skin><Skin Tests><Specimen><Spinal Puncture><Steele-Richardson-Olszewski Disease><Steele-Richardson-Olszewski Syndrome><Submandibular gland><Submaxillary Gland><Symptoms><Tauopathies><Testing><Time><Tissues><a-syn><a-synuclein><abnormally aggregated tau protein><active followup><ages><alpha synuclein><alpha synuclein gene><alphaSP22><asyn><atypical parkinsonism><bio-markers><biologic marker><biomarker><biomarker identification><cadaveric><cadavers><care for patients><care of patients><caring for patients><cerebral spinal fluid><co-morbid><co-morbidity><cohort><comorbidity><comparator group><comparison group><cortical basal degeneration><cortico-basal degeneration><corticobasal degeneration><cutaneous biopsy><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><dementia in PD><dementia in Parkinson disease><diagnostic approach><diagnostic biomarker><diagnostic marker><diagnostic strategy><diagnostic tool><disease severity><early detection><filamentous tau inclusion><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><hypersensitivity test><identification of biomarkers><identification of new biomarkers><immunologic skin test><improved><insoluble aggregate><marker identification><microtubule associated protein tau aggregation><microtubule associated protein tau deposit><microtubule bound tau><microtubule-bound tau><necropsy><neurodegenerative illness><neurological disease><neuropathologic><neuropathologic tau><neuropathological><neuropathological tau><neuropathology><non A-beta component of AD amyloid><non A4 component of amyloid precursor><paired helical filament of tau><participant enrollment><participant recruitment><pathophysiology><patient enrollment><patient stratification><postmortem><primary degenerative dementia><prion-like><protein aggregate><protein aggregation><self-aggregate tau><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><skin biopsy><spinal fluid><stratified patient><synucleinopathy><tau><tau PHF><tau Proteins><tau accumulation><tau aggregate><tau aggregation><tau associated neurodegeneration><tau associated neurodegenerative process><tau factor><tau fibrillization><tau filament><tau induced neurodegeneration><tau mediated neurodegeneration><tau neurodegenerative disease><tau neurofibrillary tangle><tau neuropathology><tau oligomer><tau paired helical filament><tau polymerization><tau-tau interaction><tauopathic neurodegenerative disorder><tauopathy><therapeutic agent development><therapeutic development><tissue biomarkers><α synuclein gene><α-syn><α-synuclein><τ Proteins><τ aggregation>",Acquired Cognitive Impairment;

Achieving specificity in imaging neurodegeneration with visible light Optical Coherence Tomography,Achieving specificity in imaging neurodegeneration with visible light Optical Coherence Tomography,"Abstract:
Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD)
have different underlying pathophysiological substrates. It follows, then, that these disorders may
affect the visual system in different ways. Structural and functional changes in the visual system
are critical to understanding and treating symptoms and impairments that impact quality of life.
Structure, as revealed by imaging of the retina, an outgrowth of the brain that is amenable to
direct visualization, can provide potential biomarkers to aid in the monitoring of disease
progression. Advances in in vivo optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging over the past few
decades have shown that eyes of patients with AD and PD have generalized thinning of inner
retinal layers associated with the ganglion cells, and microvascular changes. However, such
changes likely do not directly reflect the primary pathology across the spectrum of
neurodegenerative diseases.
Deciphering different manifestations of the ocular component to neurodegenerative disease
requires a clear step forward in the level of detail provided by approaches to image the retina. To
achieve this, we propose to develop and optimize the next generation of visible light optical
coherence tomography (OCT), with 1 micrometer depth resolution, and associated machine
learning tools, for imaging and quantifying ocular neurodegeneration. Our visible light OCT
instrument achieves 3-5x better resolution than commercial near-infrared OCT systems. The
improved resolution provides a uniquely stratified view of cellular architecture in the inner nuclear
layer (INL) and of synapses in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), potentially providing in vivo insights
into circuit- or cell-specific retinal changes that have been reported in both AD and PD.
Performing OCT in the visible light range is also significant because macular pigments, which are
associated with cognition, are detectable and quantifiable through novel approaches. In addition,
hyperspectral information in the visible light range purportedly detects protein deposits in the
retina. In fact, our preliminary results suggest the ability to both localize hyper-reflective features
in an amyloid AD mouse model and to decipher their hyperspectral signatures.
Guided by basic studies in mice that verify the relationship of imaging features to disease
pathophysiology, we will investigate the potential for visible light OCT measures and markers to
distinguish eyes of persons with MCI (AD) and PD, both between disorders and with comparison
to cognitively and neurologically normal controls of similar age. Based on the premise that
oculomics is enhanced by placing the eye in the context of the entire visual pathway, our research
plan, supported by our team’s expertise, will integrate advanced imaging with visual function
testing and quality of life measures.","<AD dementia><Accounting><Affect><Age><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer beta-Protein><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimer's amyloid><Alzheimer's disease patient><Alzheimer's patient><Alzheimers Dementia><Amacrine Cells><Amyloid><Amyloid (Aβ) plaques><Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein><Amyloid Beta-Peptide><Amyloid Plaques><Amyloid Protein A4><Amyloid Substance><Amyloid beta-Protein><Amyloid β><Amyloid β-Peptide><Amyloid β-Protein><Architecture><Aβ><Aβ burden><Biological Markers><Blood><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Blood Vessels><Brain><Brain Nervous System><CNS Nervous System><Carotenes and Carotenoids><Carotenoids><Cell Body><Cells><Central Nervous System><Cerebrospinal Fluid><Circadian Dysregulation><Cognition><Cognitive><Contrast Sensitivity><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Deposit><Deposition><Diagnosis><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Dopamine><Doppler OCT><Drugs><Dysfunction><Early Diagnosis><Encephalon><Engineering / Architecture><Eye><Eyeball><Functional disorder><Ganglion Cell Layer><Goals><Histopathology><Human><Hydroxytyramine><Image><Imaging technology><Impairment><Inflammation><Inner Nuclear Layer><Inner Plexiform Layer><Leanness><Leutin><Lutein><Machine Learning><Measures><Medication><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Monitor><Murine><Mus><Nerve Degeneration><Nerve Fibers><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neuraxis><Neuritic Plaques><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neurological><Neuron Degeneration><OCT Tomography><Optical Coherence Tomography><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Pathogenesis><Pathology><Pathway interactions><Patients><Performance><Persons><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Physiopathology><Pigments><Population><Preclinical Testing><Primary Parkinsonism><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Productivity><Proteins><QOL><Quality of life><Reporting><Research><Resolution><Retina><Retinal Ganglion Cells><Senile Plaques><Sight><Specificity><Structure><Synapses><Synaptic><System><Technology><Testing><Thinness><Visible Light><Visible Light Radiation><Visible Radiation><Vision><Visual><Visual Contrast Sensitivity><Visual Pathways><Visual System><Visualization><a beta peptide><a-beta burden><abeta><abeta burden><abeta deposition><ages><amyloid beta><amyloid beta deposition><amyloid beta plaque><amyloid burden><amyloid β deposition><amyloid-b plaque><amyloid-b protein><aβ deposition><aβ plaques><beta amyloid burden><beta amyloid fibril><beta-carotene-3,3'-diol><bio-markers><biologic marker><biomarker><brain atrophy><carotenoid biosynthesis><cell type><cerebral atrophy><cerebral spinal fluid><circadian abnormality><circadian disruption><circadian disturbance><circadian dysfunction><circadian impairment><compare to control><comparison control><cored plaque><cortical atrophy><cost><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><density><diffuse plaque><drug/agent><early detection><functional loss><gamma Lutein><gangliocyte><ganglion cell><imaging><imaging approach><imaging based approach><improved><in vivo><in vivo fluorescence imaging><in-vivo fluorescence imaging><insight><instrument><machine based learning><macula><macular><melanopsin><meter><mild cognitive disorder><mild cognitive impairment><mouse model><murine model><neural degeneration><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neurodegenerative illness><neurological degeneration><neuronal degeneration><new approaches><next generation><novel><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><optical Doppler tomography><optical coherence Doppler tomography><p-tau><p-τ><pathophysiology><pathway><patient living with Alzheimer's disease><patient suffering from Alzheimer's disease><patient with Alzheimer's><patient with Alzheimer's disease><phospho-tau><phospho-τ><phosphorylated tau><pigment><post-translational modification of tau><posttranslational modification of tau><potential biological marker><potential biomarker><pre-clinical testing><primary degenerative dementia><resolutions><retina imaging><retinal ganglion><retinal imaging><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><soluble amyloid precursor protein><specific biomarkers><spinal fluid><standard measure><symptom treatment><symptomatic treatment><synapse><tau phosphorylation><tau posttranslational modification><tau-1><tool><treat symptom><vascular><visual function><zeaxanthin><β-amyloid burden><βamyloid burden><τ phosphorylation>",Acquired Cognitive Impairment;

In vitro myelination assay modeling the environment of MS lesions for predictive discovery of remyelinating therapies.,In vitro myelination assay modeling the environment of MS lesions for predictive discovery of remyelinating therapies.,"Project Summary
Artificial Axon Labs Inc. (AAL), an MIT spinout, is developing a transformative drug screening platform, Artificial
Axons, to discover first-in-class remyelinating therapies for currently incurable myelin diseases, with the primary
focus on multiple sclerosis (MS). Current disease modifying therapies for MS prevent the formation of new
inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), but the majority of prior lesions fail to remyelinate and
there are no clinically available therapies to promote remyelination and prevent neurodegeneration. One of the
major roadblocks in the discovery of remyelinating drugs is the lack of biomimetic drug screening tools that can
quantify myelination in response to screened compounds, and do it in the conditions that mimic the environment
of demyelinating MS lesions, which often contain factors that inhibit myelin repair. Assays based on tissues or
co-cultures of neurons with oligodendrocytes are too complex for effective drug screening. Current screening
methods typically rely on 2-dimensional assays that can only evaluate compounds’ potential to stimulate
differentiation of oligodendrocytes (myelinating cells in the CNS), but not an actual process of myelin wrapping,
which requires 3-dimensional axon-like structures. Existing in vitro 3D myelination assays such as glass cones
or electrospun fibers are made of materials several orders of magnitude stiffer than the nervous tissue, and
therefore provide unphysiological environment to myelinating cells. As the result, remyelinating drug candidates
discovered with these insufficient tools so far have limited success in the clinic.
 To address this urgent need, AAL is developing Artificial Axons, a novel biomimetic 3D-printed drug discovery
platform for remyelinating compounds. Unlike any other platform, our platform enables remyelinating drug
screening by direct visualization and quantification of myelin wrapping in response to compounds in the MS
lesion-like environment. We create this environment by combining 3D-printed axon mimics, matching the
geometry and low mechanical stiffness of biological axons, with key pro-inflammatory soluble factors, which
inhibit myelination in MS lesions (interferon gamma and myelin debris). These critical advantages over existing
assays make our platform a superior tool for the discovery of remyelinating compounds. In this project we focus
on two milestones: 1) developing a myelination assay, which includes common inflammatory factors that inhibit
myelin repair in MS lesions (interferon gamma and myelin debris), and 2) validating the new assay by testing
how the efficacy of known pro-myelinating compounds changes in the hostile environment of MS lesions.
Achieving these milestones will advance our technology on the path to commercialization and accelerate the
discovery of remyelinating treatments for MS and other myelin diseases.",<2-dimensional><3-D><3-D print><3-D printer><3-Dimensional><3D><3D Print><3D printer><3D printing><AD dementia><Acceleration><Address><Affect><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><Architecture><Assay><Axon><Bioassay><Biological><Biological Assay><Biological Mimetics><Biomimetics><Body Tissues><Brain><Brain Nervous System><CNS Nervous System><Cell Body><Cells><Central Nervous System><Cessation of life><Characteristics><Clinic><Clinical><Co-culture><Cocultivation><Coculture><Coculture Techniques><Complex><Cone><Data><Death><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Demyelinations><Development><Disease><Disorder><Disseminated Sclerosis><Dose><Drug Screening><Drugs><Elements><Encephalon><Engineering><Engineering / Architecture><Environment><Fiber><Geometry><Glass><Goals><Grant><IFN-Gamma><IFN-g><IFN-γ><IFNG><IFNγ><Immune Interferon><In Vitro><Inflammatory><Interferon Gamma><Interferon Type II><Legal patent><Lesion><Libraries><MS Lesions><MS patient><MS treatment><Measures><Mechanics><Medication><Membrane><Methods><Modeling><Multiple Sclerosis><Multiple Sclerosis Lesions><Myelin><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Natural regeneration><Nerve Cells><Nerve Degeneration><Nerve Tissue><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Nervous Tissue><Neural Cell><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neuraxis><Neurocyte><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neurologic Disorders><Neurological Disorders><Neuron Degeneration><Neurons><OL myelination><Oligodendrocytes><Oligodendrocytus><Oligodendroglia><Oligodendroglia Cell><Optic Neuritis><Outcome><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Patents><Patients><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phase><Phenotype><Preparation><Primary Parkinsonism><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Process><Property><Regeneration><Reproducibility><SBIR><Screening procedure><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Structure><Technology><Therapeutic><Tissues><United States National Institutes of Health><Visualization><biologic><cell type><commercialization><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><demyelinate><developmental><disability><drug candidate><drug detection><drug discovery><drug testing><drug/agent><efficacy testing><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><flexibility><flexible><inhibitor><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><insular sclerosis><lFN-Gamma><leukodystrophy><mechanic><mechanical><membrane structure><multiple sclerosis patient><multiple sclerosis therapy><multiple sclerosis treatment><myelination><neural degeneration><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neurodegenerative illness><neurological degeneration><neurological disease><neuronal><neuronal degeneration><new approaches><novel><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><oligodendrocyte myelination><patients with MS><patients with multiple sclerosis><people with Multiple sclerosis><performance tests><permissiveness><preparations><prevent><preventing><primary degenerative dementia><re-myelinate><re-myelination><regenerate><remyelinate><remyelination><repair><repaired><response><screening><screening tools><screenings><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><success><technology platform><technology system><three dimensional><three dimensional printing><tool><two-dimensional><virtual model>,Autoimmune Disease; Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Multiple Sclerosis; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences
A Mechanistic Foundation for the Iron Homeostasis Impacts and Neurotrophic Activity of trans-Banglene,A Mechanistic Foundation for the Iron Homeostasis Impacts and Neurotrophic Activity of trans-Banglene,"Project Summary/Abstract
Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease, constitute one of
the greatest challenges in modern therapeutic development due to an inadequate understanding of the
interplay of pro- and anti-apoptotic feedback mechanisms operative in the progression of these diseases. This
inadequate understanding is in part due to a lack of practical (crosses blood-brain-barrier, well-studied
mechanism of action) biochemical tools to modulate and effect related cellular processes, such as neurotrophic
responses (pro-survival, pro-growth, and pro-differentation responses), and metal ion homeostasis levels,
which are both significantly perturbed in neurodegenerative contexts.
 The Williams lab and Epp lab propose to evaluate the mechanism and pathological impacts of a non-peptide
small molecule, called trans-banglene (t-BG), which has demonstrated neurotrophic effects in cell culture,
primary neurons and mouse models of neurodegeneration, is orally bioavailable, and also has recently been
shown by the Williams lab to alter iron-binding proteins in PC 12 cells. This combined impact on neurotrophic
responses and iron homeostasis makes t-BG well suited to provide insight into the interplay between these two
cellular response mechanisms. However, a cellular target and mechanism of action is not yet known for t-BG.
 The following proposal outlines work to 1) identify the cell recognition/binding partner and localization upon
binding, 2) characterize t-BG treatment impacts on known neurotrophic signal transduction pathways, iron
localization, and lipid oxidation profile in cells and tissues and 3) to evaluate impacts on neuronal morphology,
plasticity and neurogenesis in AD mouse models. The interdisciplinary setting of the Williams lab enables both
synthetic access to derivatives of this molecular scaffold as well as cell response data from biochemical assays
of their activity. The Epp lab will concurrently validate mechanistic impacts in hAPOE4 knock-in mouse tissues
and measure changes in neurogenesis/neuron structure.
 Importantly, these mechanistic studies will improve understanding of the differential drivers of neurotrophic
effects and iron homeostasis. Once mechanism of action is determined, and validated in mouse models, this
orally bioavailable molecular tool can be broadly employed in the biomedical community to study inhibition of
neurodegenerative disease progression, helping to create the foundation for new medicinal strategies. Further,
once a cellular target is established, future work will use structural information regarding binding mode to inform
optimization studies that increase potency and drug-like characteristics for t-BG, improving its utility and
facilitating drug development investigations.",<AD dementia><AD related dementia><ADRD><APOE e4><APOE-ε4><APOEε4><Address><Affect><Aging><Alleles><Allelomorphs><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer

"Role of N-terminal acetylation in alpha synuclein stability, function, and therapeutic targeting in synucleinopathies","Role of N-terminal acetylation in alpha synuclein stability, function, and therapeutic targeting in synucleinopathies","Project Summary
Decades of genetic and experimental evidence has placed α-synuclein (αS) as a central player in the
pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Alzheimer’s Disease
(AD) and related dementias (ADRD). αS protein levels closely correlate with PD and ADRD risk, and reduction
has been shown to be protective in multiple disease models, making lowering αS levels a target for therapeutic
intervention. Despite that, there is very poor understanding of how the abundance and turnover of endogenous
αS protein is regulated. We recently found, using unbiased CRISPR screens in human cell lines and iPSC-
derived neurons, that disruption of the NatB complex resulted in a stark reduction in endogenous protein levels
and is well tolerated in human iPSC derived neurons. NatB installs N-terminal acetylation (AcN) of αS.
While AcN is a prevalent post-translational modification, its functional consequences are not well understood.
AcN has been implicated in several processes specific to αS, such as membrane binding, cell uptake, and
aggregation. Indeed, our own preliminary data support the importance of these effects and more. These results
led us to hypothesize that lack of αS AcN compromises interactions that are fundamental to its molecular
function and that pharmacological targeting of AcN represents a novel therapeutic strategy for αS’s
involvement in PD and ADRDs.
 We propose three aims that will rigorously investigate the implications of these findings on αS biology
and therapeutics. In Aim 1, we will identify the molecular interactions that are lost when αS lacks AcN. We
believe that this will provide critical insight into its biological function. We will also investigate the mechanisms
responsible for the rapid degradation of non-AcN αS compared to AcN αS. This may provide additional tools
for therapeutic reduction of pathological αS in disease and insight into αS turnover mechanisms. In Aim 2, we
will focus on understanding the outcome of NatB inhibition on the proteome and N-terminal acetylome of
human cells and neurons using quantitative proteomics approaches. Such understanding will be essential for
the development of NatB as a therapeutic target. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will develop the first NatB
pharmacological inhibitors for evaluation in vitro, and in iPSC derived neurons. We use state-of-the-art
computational approaches in combination with experimental high-throughput screening to identify molecules
that can inhibit NatB acetylation of αS with minimal effects on AcN of other proteins. These molecules will
serve as essential research tools and as lead therapeutic candidates for PD and ADRDs.",<AD dementia><AD related dementia><ADRD><Acetylation><Acetyltransferase><Active Follow-up><Affect><Alzheimer

Metabolic determinants of reactive astrogliosis and cognitive heterogeneity in aging,Metabolic determinants of reactive astrogliosis and cognitive heterogeneity in aging,"ABSTRACT
The greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is aging, but the mechanisms that
link aging to ADRD disease processes are largely unknown. Of particular interest, recent single-cell transcriptomic
studies of aged hippocampal astrocytes, and multi-transcriptomic analysis of astrocytes from human AD samples
and a mouse model of AD, show commonalities in the decline of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) and mitophagy related pathways. Although cognitive function can decline with age, many human and
animal model subjects retain function. Current behavioral/cognitive testing paradigms are inefficient at discerning
cognitive trajectories in aging. We have developed a unique automated home-cage testing paradigm for spatial
memory that can reliably stratify cognitive performance in aged mice into cognitively ‘intact’ and ‘impaired’
subgroups. Molecular analyses show significant declines in OXPHOS genes, mitochondrial function and
concomitant increases in markers of astrogliosis specifically in ‘impaired’ mice. Whether impairments in astrocyte
mitochondrial function are a driver of reactive astrogliosis associated with cognitive impairment in aging and AD
is unresolved and is a critical question since it guides future therapeutic interventions. Our central hypothesize
is that deficits in astrocyte mitochondrial function and mitochondrial proteostasis drive reactive
astrogliosis that contribute to cognitive impairment in aging and AD, and that therapies that improve
astrocyte mitochondrial function will delay cognitive decline. The following aims are proposed: Aim 1.
Identify astrocyte subtypes with dysfunctional mitochondria in hippocampus of cognitively impaired
aged mice. We will use high resolution respirometry to measure mitochondrial function in isolated hippocampal
mitochondria from aged cognitively stratified mice. We will perform scRNAseq on hippocampal astrocytes to
identify subtypes that are specific to cognitive impairment and allow us to differentiate between healthy aging
and cognitive impairment. Aim 2. Define the role of mitochondrial proteostasis in reactive astrogliosis of
aged mice. We will assess mitochondrial protein turnover rates as well as turnover of targeted mitochondrial
proteins using D2O labeling of proteins in astrocytes from young, aged-intact and -impaired mice and determine
the contribution of mitophagy to astrocyte-mediated cognitive decline in aging. We expect these experiments will
link decreased mitochondrial protein turnover rate and mitophagy to the genesis of reactive astrogliosis and
cognitive impairment. Aim 3. Determine whether interventions that improve astrocyte mitochondrial
function alleviate cognitive impairment in aged and APP/PS1 mice. We will use AAV5-mediated
overexpression of SOD2 specifically in astrocytes delivered via stereotactic injections into the hippocampus of
cognitively stratified aged, and APP/PSI mice. We expect that the intervention will improve mitochondrial
proteostasis, reduce reactive astrogliosis, and improve cognition. These experiments are the first to address the
molecular determinants of cognitive heterogeneity in aging.",<AD dementia><AD model><AD related dementia><ADRD><APP-PS1><APP/PS1><Ablation><Address><Age><Age-associated cognitive decline><Age-associated memory impairment><Age-related cognitive decline><Aging><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer risk factor><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimer's and related dementias><Alzheimer's disease and related dementia><Alzheimer's disease and related disorders><Alzheimer's disease model><Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia><Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder><Alzheimer's disease or related dementia><Alzheimer's disease related dementia><Alzheimer's disease risk><Alzheimers Dementia><Amentia><Ammon Horn><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Antioxidants><Assay><Assessment instrument><Assessment tool><Astrocytes><Astrocytus><Astroglia><Astroprotein><Behavioral><Benign senescent forgetfulness><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Cell Body><Cells><Cognition><Cognitive><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive aging><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Cornu Ammonis><Data><Dementia><Disease><Disorder><Disturbance in cognition><Down-Regulation><Electron Transport><Endosomes><Epilepsy><Epileptic Seizures><Epileptics><FK506 Binding Protein 12-Rapamycin Associated Protein 1><FKBP12 Rapamycin Complex Associated Protein 1><FRAP1><FRAP1 gene><FRAP2><Future><GFA-Protein><GFAP><Gene Transcription><Genes><Genetic><Genetic Transcription><Genus Hippocampus><Glial Fibrillary Acid Protein><Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein><Glial Intermediate Filament Protein><Health><Heterogeneity><Hippocampus><Home><Human><IPO-B><Impaired cognition><Impairment><Individual><Indophenol Oxidase B><Inflammation><Inflammatory><Injections><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Investigation><Knowledge><Label><Link><MNSOD><Manganese Superoxide Dismutase><Measures><Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin><Mediating><Mediator><Metabolic><Metabolic Protein Degradation><Mice><Mice Mammals><Mitochondria><Mitochondrial Proteins><Mitochondrial Superoxide Dismutase><Mn Superoxide Dismutase><Mn-SOD><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><Molecular Analysis><Molecular Probes><Murine><Mus><Oxidative Phosphorylation><Oxidative Phosphorylation Pathway><Oxidative Stress><PARK6><PARK6 gene><PARK6 protein><PINK1><PINK1 gene><PINK1 gene product><PINK1 protein><PSI><PTEN induced kinase 1><PTEN induced putative kinase 1><PTEN-induced putative kinase><Parkin><Parkin gene><Parkinson disease 6 gene><Pathway interactions><Phosphatase and tensin homolog induced kinase 1><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Process><Protein Structure Initiative><Protein Turnover><Proteins><Publishing><RAFT1><RNA Expression><Receptosomes><Regulatory Protein Degradation><Resolution><Role><SOD2><SOD2 gene><Sampling><Seahorse><Seizure Disorder><Spirometry><Subgroup><Superoxide Dismutase 2><Synapses><Synaptic><Testing><Therapeutic Intervention><Transcription><age associated decline><age associated memory decline><age dependent decline><age related cognitive deficit><age related cognitive impairment><age related decline><age related memory dysfunction><age stratification><age-induced cognitive decline><age-related decline in cognition><age-related decline in cognitive function><aged><aged animal><aged animals><aged hippocampus><aged mice><aged mouse><ages><aging hippocampus><alzheimer model><alzheimer risk><animal old age><astrocytic glia><astrogliosis><cognitive ability><cognitive assessment><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive function><cognitive loss><cognitive performance><cognitive testing><decline with age><elderly animal><elderly mice><electron transfer><epilepsia><epileptogenic><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><healthy aging><healthy human aging><hippocampal><homes><human model><improved><insight><interest><intervention therapy><interventional strategy><mTOR><mammalian target of rapamycin><mitochondrial><mitochondrial dysfunction><mitochondrial metabolism><model of animal><model of human><mouse model><murine model><neural inflammation><neuroinflammation><neuroinflammatory><old animals><old mice><overexpress><overexpression><oxidative damage><oxidative injury><parkin protein><pathway><preservation><primary degenerative dementia><promoter><promotor><protein degradation><protein homeostasis><protein kinase BRPK><protein kinase BRPK gene><proteostasis><resolutions><response><scRNA-seq><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><serine/threonine-protein kinase PINK1><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single-cell RNA sequencing><social role><spatial memory><synapse><targeted drug therapy><targeted drug treatments><targeted therapeutic><targeted therapeutic agents><targeted therapy><targeted treatment><trafficking><transcriptomics>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment;

BIOGENESIS OF THE MITOCHONDRIAL INNER MEMBRANE,BIOGENESIS OF THE MITOCHONDRIAL INNER MEMBRANE,"SUMMARY
 Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common contributing factor to degenerative diseases, including the
neural and muscular systems; yet mechanistic studies in mammals are limited because adequate tools and
approaches are lacking. Moreover, a greater understanding of the protein translocation mechanisms in model
organisms such as S. cerevisiae and zebrafish is needed, because protein translocation is linked to
metabolism, signaling, and mitochondrial quality control and stress pathways such as mitophagy. Long-term,
modulating mitochondrial protein import pathways therefore is a potential target for treating diseases.
 The overall goals of this proposal are (1) to increase our mechanistic understanding of protein import
pathways into mitochondria in both yeast and mammalian cells and (2) to understand how defects in protein
translocation contribute to disease. Attenuating protein translocation pathways can alter the location of
mitochondrial proteins that are dual-localized (located to mitochondria and another compartment), change
mitochondrial stress pathways, and induce selective turnover of mitochondria via mitophagy. However, there is
a critical gap in developing small molecule probes with specificity for modulating mitochondrial protein import
specifically in mammalian cells while minimizing off-target effects.
 Three specific study aims are proposed to accomplish these goals. In Aim 1, a new cell based screen in
mammalian cells to identify modulators for all mitochondrial protein import pathways and specific cargo will be
implemented. In Aim 2, a series of experimental approaches will be used to characterize specificity of the
probes, to minimize off-target effects in mammalian cells and yeast, with the goal of developing specific
probes. In Aim 3, existing and new small molecules will be characterized in mechanistic studies, particularly
focusing on how defects in protein import alter mitochondrial stress pathways in mitophagy.
 In addition to increasing fundamental knowledge about the mechanisms of protein translocation in
mitochondria, this application may have a broad impact on public health because our approach will provide
new tools that will provide a strategy for developing therapeutics for diseases that can be modified by
attenuating protein translocation.",<Ataxia><Ataxy><Autoregulation><Baker's Yeast><Biogenesis><Biologic Models><Biological Models><Body Tissues><Brachydanio rerio><Brewer's Yeast><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Chaperone><Chemicals><Complex><Congestive Cardiomyopathy><Coordination Impairment><Danio rerio><Data><Defect><Degenerative Disorder><Development><Dilated Cardiomyopathy><Disease><Disorder><Dysfunction><Dyssynergia><Failure><Functional disorder><Funding><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic defect><Goals><Grant><HMSN Type V><Hereditary Motor-Sensory Neuropathy with Pyramidal Signs><Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia><Homeostasis><Hour><Inner mitochondrial membrane><Intermediary Metabolism><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Knowledge><Laboratories><Lead><Link><Location><Mammalia><Mammalian Cell><Mammals><Membrane><Metabolic Processes><Metabolism><Mitochondria><Mitochondrial Diseases><Mitochondrial Disorders><Mitochondrial Proteins><Model System><Modeling><Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome><Molecular><Molecular Chaperones><Mutation><New Agents><Origin of Life><PARK6><PARK6 gene><PARK6 protein><PINK1><PINK1 gene><PINK1 gene product><PINK1 protein><PTEN induced kinase 1><PTEN induced putative kinase 1><PTEN-induced putative kinase><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Parkinson disease 6 gene><Pathway interactions><Pb element><Phosphatase and tensin homolog induced kinase 1><Physiological Homeostasis><Physiopathology><Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing><Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing><Primary Parkinsonism><Protein Import><Protein translocation><Proteins><Public Health><Quality Control><RNA Interference><RNA Silencing><RNAi><Research><Role><S cerevisiae><S. cerevisiae><Saccharomyces cerevisiae><Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing><Series><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Spastic Paraplegia-Hypertrophic Motor-Sensory Neuropathy><Specificity><Stress><Subcellular Process><System><Therapeutic><Tissues><Transmembrane Protein Transport><Type V Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy><Work><X-linked recessive deafness syndrome><Yeasts><Zebra Danio><Zebra Fish><Zebrafish><biological signal transduction><degenerative condition><degenerative disease><developmental><dystonia-deafness syndrome><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><gain of function><genome mutation><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><knock-down><knockdown><membrane structure><mitochondrial><mitochondrial dysfunction><model organism><muscle system><muscular system><mutant><neural><novel><pathophysiology><pathway><protein kinase BRPK><protein kinase BRPK gene><screening><screenings><serine/threonine-protein kinase PINK1><small molecule><social role><tool><translocase>,Rare Diseases
Bacterial disruption of neuroimmune pathways in a transparent brain,Bacterial disruption of neuroimmune pathways in a transparent brain,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Cells of the immune system, bacteria, and neurons are constantly interacting on every
surface of the human body. Recent studies show that bacteria have evolved mechanisms to
engage with the nervous system, often using the phagocytes that regulate inflammation.
Neuroinflammation, or inflammation in neurological tissue, is thought to contribute to common
neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, although
the basic mechanisms of neuroinflammation remain incompletely understood. The long-term
objective of this New Innovator Award proposal is to define the molecular mechanisms of
neuroinflammation during infection. The innovation is our adaptation of the cutting-edge
zebrafish molecular toolkit (optogenetics, biosensors, in vivo biotinylation) to host-pathogen
interactions. With this system, we can genetically modify host and pathogen, then observe
bacteria invading the transparent zebrafish brain in real-time. As pathogens, we use
mycobacterial species that activate neuroinflammation in humans (TB meningitis, leprosy) and
in zebrafish. We have also developed new zebrafish brain infection models, using human
pathogens isolated from meningitis patients, in order to determine:
Project 1: How do bacteria invade the brain from the blood?
 Approach: Define the endothelial mechanisms of brain invasion and vascular injury.
Project 2: How do host versus pathogen factors drive catastrophic brain inflammation?
 Approach: Optogenetic (light-activated) control of phagocytes in vivo.
Project 3: How do host versus pathogen factors injure neurons?
 Approach: Identifying infectious mechanisms of neuronal injury using biosensors.
 To answer these questions, this proposal combines immunobiology and neurobiology
tools with brain infection models in zebrafish. Using live imaging of zebrafish brain infection,
and genetic modification of fluorescent bacteria, neurons, and phagocytes, the earliest
inflammatory and neurodegenerative events can be directly observed in unprecedented detail.
Completion of this work fulfills two goals. First, it will provide needed mechanistic information
on the host cells and molecules that mediate injury in understudied brain infections that
disproportionately affect people living in poverty. This will support the goal of developing new
therapies that limit brain inflammation. Beyond infection, the basic biological mechanisms of
neuroinflammation, revealed by infection, will likely be relevant to the many non-infectious
neurodegenerative conditions that are characterized by neuroinflammation.",<AD dementia><Affect><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><Award><Bacteria><Biological><Biology><Biosensor><Biotinylation><Blood><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Blood flow><Body Tissues><Brachydanio rerio><Brain><Brain Inflammation><Brain Nervous System><Cell Body><Cells><Communication><Danio rerio><Development><Encephalitis><Encephalon><Endothelium><Event><Gene Modified><Genetic><Goals><Hansen's Disease><Human><Human Figure><Human body><Image><Immune system><Immunobiology><Immunophysiology><Impoverished><Infection><Inflammation><Inflammatory><Injury><Invaded><Leprosy><Light><Mediating><Meningeal TB><Meningeal Tuberculosis><Meningitis><Modeling><Modern Man><Modification><Molecular><Nerve Cells><Nerve Degeneration><Nerve Unit><Nervous System><Neural Cell><Neurobiology><Neurocyte><Neuroimmune><Neurologic><Neurologic Body System><Neurologic Organ System><Neurological><Neuron Degeneration><Neuronal Injury><Neurons><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Pathway interactions><Patients><Persons><Phagocytes><Phagocytic Cell><Photoradiation><Poverty><Primary Parkinsonism><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Public Health><Surface><System><TB meningitis><Time><Tissues><Tuberculosis Meningitis><Tuberculous Meningitis><Work><Zebra Danio><Zebra Fish><Zebrafish><amebocyte><biologic><biological sensor><developmental><gene modification><genetically modified><human pathogen><imaging><in vivo><injuries><injury to the vasculature><innovate><innovation><innovative><mycobacterial><neural degeneration><neural inflammation><neurobiological><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neuroinflammation><neuroinflammatory><neurological degeneration><neuron injury><neuronal><neuronal degeneration><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new therapeutics><new therapy><next generation therapeutics><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><optogenetics><pathogen><pathway><primary degenerative dementia><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><tool><vascular injury>,Brain Disorders; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases; Tuberculosis
Elucidating the regulation and function of amyloid-like assemblies,Elucidating the regulation and function of amyloid-like assemblies,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although amyloids are best understood for their roles in the etiology of numerous human diseases as
pathological protein deposits, amyloid and amyloid-like assemblies can serve critical functions1. To mediate
these functions, some cells have the ability to regulate assembly and clearance of these structures2,3. My
research vision is to delineate the physiological pathways and mechanisms that healthy cells have evolved to
regulate formation, function, and reversibility of amyloids. These studies are motivated by our discovery that in
order to control translation during meiosis, budding yeast regulates assembly of the RNA-binding protein Rim4
into a translational repressor that has several biochemical properties of an amyloid (thus termed amyloid-like)2.
Knowledge gained from these studies will lead to important advances in our understanding of the causes of
neurodegenerative diseases and in time could lead to therapeutic opportunities.
 Based on our recent progress studying Rim4 clearance, we now appreciate that yeast cells use multi-
site phosphorylation to abruptly reverse amyloid-like Rim4 into oligomers and monomers at meiosis II onset4. A
major goal of my research program over the next five years is to understand the molecular mechanisms
underlying this remarkable process. Additionally, we will decipher the signals and pathways that trigger the
formation of Rim4 assemblies and we will elucidate how translation is regulated by these structures.
 Budding yeast is a powerful experimental system to study these processes. My lab can easily grow
populations of cells that rapidly and synchronously produce, and then clear, amyloid-like Rim4. We have
developed fluorescence-based reporters that allow us to quantify Rim4 assembly and function in single cells
and selection-based reporters that enable robust genetic screens. We have used these tools, in combination
with biochemical approaches, to begin to illuminate the essential factors that govern how these extraordinary
structures are constructed by the cell and the molecular mechanisms underpinning their function.
 The MIRA award provided me with the support that I needed to launch and maintain my independent
research program. While we made substantial progress towards our stated goals, this award also gave the
researchers in my lab the freedom to explore fruitful departures from our main focus. For example, we
discovered that yeast cells utilize amyloid-like Rim4 to block the translation of retrotransposon mRNA to protect
the genomic integrity of developing gametes. By making these unexpected discoveries and by developing new
tools, my lab has entered an exciting phase where we are rapidly gaining important insights into how cells
regulate, utilize, and process amyloid-like assemblies. Each discovery serves as a potential lead toward a
therapy for amyloid-related diseases, which are needed because few, if any, effective preventative therapies
are currently available. Columbia University and the Taub Institute for Alzheimer’s and Aging Research
provides the supportive framework and collaborative opportunities to make this possible.",<AD dementia><Aging><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><Amyloid><Amyloid Substance><Award><Biochemical><Budding Yeast><Causality><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cells><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Deposit><Deposition><Disease><Disorder><Endomycetales><Etiology><Fluorescence><Freedom><Gametes><Genetic Screening><Germ Cells><Germ-Line Cells><Goals><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigators><Knowledge><Lead><Liberty><Mediating><Meiosis><Messenger RNA><Molecular><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Pathologic><Pathway interactions><Pb element><Phase><Phosphorylation Site><Physiologic><Physiological><Play><Population><Prealbumin><Preventative therapy><Preventive therapy><Primary Parkinsonism><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Proalbumin><Process><Property><Proteins><RNA-Binding Proteins><Regulation><Reporter><Reproductive Cells><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Retrotransposon><Role><Saccharomycetales><Sex Cell><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Structure><System><Therapeutic><Time><Translations><Transthyretin><Universities><Yeasts><biological signal transduction><cardiac amyloidosis><causation><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><disease causation><fibrous protein><genome integrity><genomic integrity><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><human disease><initial cell><insight><mRNA><meiotic><monomer><neurodegenerative illness><pathway><primary degenerative dementia><programs><research vision><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><sexual cell><social role><tool><translation>,Aging
Biomarker discovery for parkinsonian diseases in extracellular vesicles from iPSC-derived neurons,Biomarker discovery for parkinsonian diseases in extracellular vesicles from iPSC-derived neurons,"Project Abstract
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes are neurodegenerative diseases in which
symptoms include movement disorder, often autonomic dysfunction, and sometimes dementia. Due to high
symptom overlap, patients with these diseases often are misdiagnosed leading to high levels of anxiety and
depression, and to difficulty in developing therapeutic intervention. The parent grant examines candidate
biomarkers for these diseases in serum and CNS-originating extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from the
serum. However, these candidates are based on current knowledge whereas other, perhaps superior
biomarkers may not yet have been discovered. Unbiased proteomics-based biomarker discovery is a
promising approach but is practically challenging in CNS-originating EVs. Therefore, we will use EVs isolated
from the culture media of iPSC-derived neurons from patients with the same parkinsonian diseases, and
healthy controls. These studies may lead to discovery of novel biomarkers that will further aid the diagnosis,
monitoring, prognosis, and treatment of parkinsonian diseases. The supplement will support a talented
graduate student co-mentored by the PI and a proteomics expert. The student already has generated
preliminary data demonstrating that the experiments are feasible and promising. The co-mentoring, formal
classes, interaction with collaborators, and multiple professional-development opportunities will help preparing
the student for a successful and productive career as a scientific researcher.",<Administrative Supplement><Amentia><Anxiety><Autonomic Dysfunction><Baccalaureate Degree><Bachelor's Degree><Biochemistry><Biological Chemistry><Biological Markers><Blood Serum><Blood Tests><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Isolation><Cell Segregation><Cell Separation><Cell Separation Technology><Cell Signaling><Cellular biology><Cessation of life><Chemistry><Clinical Trials><Collaborations><Confusion><Confusional State><Culture Media><Data><Death><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Dementia><Development><Diagnosis><Diagnostic><Diagnostic tests><Disease><Disorder><Dysautonomia-Orthostatic Hypotension Syndrome><Dysautonomic Orthostatic Hypotension><Dyskinesia Syndromes><Eligibility><Eligibility Determination><Family><Genes><Goals><Grant><Health><Hematologic Tests><Hematological Tests><Hematology Testing><Human><Immune Precipitation><Immunoprecipitation><Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigators><Knowledge><Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis><Mass Spectrometry><Mass Spectroscopy><Mass Spectrum><Mass Spectrum Analyses><Mass Spectrum Analysis><Measures><Mental Confusion><Mental Depression><Mentors><Methods><Modern Man><Monitor><Movement Disorder Syndromes><Movement Disorders><Multiple System Atrophy><Multiple System Atrophy Syndrome><Multisystem Atrophy><Multisystemic Atrophy><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Cell><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural Stem Cell><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurocyte><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neuron from iPSC><Neuron from induced pluripotent stem cells><Neuronal Differentiation><Neurons><Ontology><Paralysis Agitans><Parents><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Parkinsonian><Parkinsonian Condition><Parkinsonian Diseases><Parkinsonian Disorders><Parkinsonian Syndrome><Parkinsonism><Patients><Primary Parkinsonism><Productivity><Progenitor Cells><Prognosis><Progressive Autonomic Failure><Progressive Supranuclear Ophthalmoplegia><Progressive Supranuclear Palsy><Proteomics><Protocol Screening><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Sampling><Serum><Shy-Drager Syndrome><Shy-Drager Type Idiopathic Orthostatic Hypotension><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Steele-Richardson-Olszewski Disease><Steele-Richardson-Olszewski Syndrome><Students><Symptoms><Talents><Tauopathies><Techniques><Testing><Therapeutic Intervention><Time><Training><Translational Research><Translational Science><Undergraduate Degree><Work><bio-markers><biobank><biologic marker><biological signal transduction><biomarker><biomarker array><biomarker discovery><biomarker identification><biomarker panel><biorepository><candidate biomarker><candidate marker><career><career development><cell biology><cell sorting><cortico-basal syndrome><corticobasal syndrome><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><depression><developmental><disadvantaged background><drug development><drug discovery><experience><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><extracellular vesicles><graduate student><growth media><high school><iPS><iPS neurons><iPSC><iPSC derived-neurons><iPSCs><identification of biomarkers><identification of new biomarkers><induced pluripotent cell><induced pluripotent stem cell><induced pluripotent stem cell neurons><induced pluripotent stem cells derived from patients><induced pluripotent stem cells from patients><inducible pluripotent stem cell><intervention therapy><marginalized background><marker identification><marker panel><minimally invasive><nerve stem cell><neural precursor><neural precursor cell><neural progenitor><neural progenitor cells><neurodegenerative illness><neuron progenitors><neuronal><neuronal progenitor><neuronal progenitor cells><neuronal stem cells><neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells><neuropathologic tau><neuropathological tau><neuroprogenitor><new marker><novel biomarker><novel marker><parent><parent award><parent grant><parent project><patient derived human iPS><patient derived human iPSC><patient derived human induced pluripotent stem cell><patient derived iPS><patient derived iPSC><patient derived induced pluripotent cells><patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells><patient-derived pluripotent stem cells><protein biomarkers><protein markers><stem cells><synucleinopathy><tau associated neurodegeneration><tau associated neurodegenerative process><tau induced neurodegeneration><tau mediated neurodegeneration><tau neurodegenerative disease><tau neuropathology><tauopathic neurodegenerative disorder><tauopathy><translation research><translational investigation>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment;

"Microbiome, Environment, and Parkinsons disease (MEP) PESTICIDE EXPOSURES AND THE GUT MICROBIOME IN PARKINSONS DISEASE","Microbiome, Environment, and Parkinsons disease (MEP) PESTICIDE EXPOSURES AND THE GUT MICROBIOME IN PARKINSONS DISEASE","Abstract.
The human microbiome has a major role in the uptake and handling of nutrients, medications, and toxins; and is of great
immune system relevance. Evidence is mounting that it can affect aspects of neurologic function, brain activity, and
behavior via the ‘gut-brain-axis’. New propositions are that environmental exposures such as pesticides, metals, and
air pollution influence the microbiome and the human immune system and that the microbiome plays a role in
Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here we propose the novel hypothesis that a) the microbiome is affected by chronic
environmental exposures, specifically pesticides; and b) an altered gut microbiome composition or function contributes
to the progression of neurodegeneration in PD. PD - a progressive neurodegenerative disease – has various non-motor
symptoms including gastro-intestinal (GI) features such as constipation and gastroparesis. Its pathologic hallmarks,
namely Lewy bodies and α-synuclein aggregates, have been found in the gut’s enteric nervous system of PD patients
along with inflammation. The role of the gut microbiome in PD is underexplored and no study has addressed
whether toxins influence neurodegeneration via the microbiome. We previously developed a resource to investigate
long-term exposure to pesticides in humans, i.e. a geographic information system (GIS) model based on records from the
California state pesticide use reporting (PUR) system. Capitalizing on our unique PUR exposure assessment tool and
the Parkinson's Disease Susceptibility Genes and Pesticides Study (PEG; R01 ES-010544) resources, we have joined forces
with Drs. Mayer and Jacob (UCLA Division of Digestive Diseases) - experts in brain-gut connection microbiome research -
and propose to analyze the gut microbiome of 400 PD patients and 600 (200 age-matched household & 400 age-sex
matched community) controls using 16S ribosomal RNA to assess relative abundance of microbiota. Specifically, we will
assess composition and function (using the predicted metagenome) in pesticide exposed vs. non-exposed controls and
PD patients of different progression phenotypes. We will newly enroll 200 new-onset, of these 100 medication naïve
(MN) PD patients, to collect data on exposures, gut motility indicators, and fecal samples for metabolomics and culture
based experiments (before and after starting PD medications); assess differences in relative abundances of microbes
over time using 16S ribosomal RNA and shotgun metagenomics and conduct metabolomics (blood or stool) analyses for
new onset PD patients (twice, longitudinally) and their household controls. We combine for this research our extensive
expertise in pesticide exposure assessment and studying PD progression in community-based patients, an exceptionally
well-characterized population living in a heavily pesticide exposed region, with the expertise of our UCLA GI team in
brain-gut axis research and the resources of the UCLA microbiome core. Our resources provide a strong and efficient
platform for addressing chronic environmental exposure to pesticides and their impacts on the gut microbiome and on
neurodegeneration. This research will suggest novel pathways and prevention options for a growing elderly population
with chronic environmental exposures.","<Active Follow-up><Address><Affect><Age><Air Pollution><Animals><Area><Assessment instrument><Assessment tool><Behavior><Biologic Models><Biological><Biological

Cutaneous Phosphorylated Alpha-Synuclein for Detection of Prodromal Synucleinopathies,Cutaneous Phosphorylated Alpha-Synuclein for Detection of Prodromal Synucleinopathies,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A group of devastating diseases, collectively termed synucleinopathies, affect over 2 million people in the U.S.,
carry significant morbidity, high mortality and enormous associated health care costs. Synucleinopathies are
characterized by the abnormal deposition of a misfolded protein, phosphorylated α−synuclein (P-SYN), within
the central and peripheral nervous systems. Synucleinopathies include Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with
Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and pure autonomic failure (PAF) differ in clinical symptoms
and disease progression rates. Currently, no disease modifying therapies exist for any of the synucleinopathies.
Deposition of P-SYN within the cutaneous (skin) nerve fibers of synucleinopathy patients provides diagnostic
clarity and increases with disease progression. Importantly, cutaneous deposition of P-SYN is also observed in
the majority of patients diagnosed with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), a prodro-
mal synucleinopathy in which >90% of patients phenoconvert to clinically apparent synucleinopathy within 15
years of diagnosis. At present, methods for determining the disease trajectory of clinically apparent synucle-
inopathy in patients with iRBD do not exist. Diagnostic tools able to evaluate and reliably predict the probability
of phenoconversion at prodromal stages is an urgent and unmet need with clinical importance and public health
implications at a global scale. Cutaneous Neurodiagnostics (CND Life Sciences), a CLIA-certified laboratory,
has developed its core enabling technology of detecting P-SYN in small (3 mm) patients’ punch skin biopsies
and launched the first commercially available diagnostic test for synucleinopathy, the Syn-One Test™. In this
Direct to Phase II study, CND Life Sciences will advance the Syn-One Test™ through detection of P-SYN
in iRBD patients to predict phenoconversion risk and accelerate the commercial viability of testing
through an innovative AI-powered augmented pathological interpretation of the results. To achieve this
objective, CND Life Sciences has conducted feasibility studies to demonstrate that cutaneous P-SYN deposition
can be reliably detected in 94-100% of synucleinopathy patients and in none of the disease control subjects,
while preliminary pilot studies showed that P-SYN is observed in 64% of iRBD patients. In this proposal, CND
Life Sciences will collaborate with the North American Prodromal Synucleinopathy (NAPS) consortium (an NIH-
funded project) to 1) define the metrics of P-SYN deposition and nerve fiber degeneration that predict pheno-
conversion in iRBD patients (Aim 1) and 2) enhance pathological reading through digital quantitative analysis of
the Syn-One Test™ using an AI-augmented detection system (Aim 2). Successful completion of this study will
advance the clinical utility of the Syn-One Test™, improving patient care, increasing the commercial potential of
the product, and ultimately accelerating the development of disease-modifying therapies.",<AI Augmented><AI enhanced><Academia><Acceleration><Active Follow-up><Address><Affect><American><Artificial Intelligence enhanced><Augmented by AI><Augmented by the AI><Augmented with AI><Augmented with the AI><Biologic Sciences><Biological Sciences><Biopsy><Bioscience><Blinded><CLIA accredited><CLIA approved><CLIA certified><CLIA compliant><CLIA licensed><CNS Nervous System><Central Nervous System><Clinical><Clinical Trials><Cognitive><Collaborations><Cutaneous><Data><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Dementia with Lewy Bodies><Deposit><Deposition><Dermatologic biopsy><Detection><Development><Diagnosis><Diagnostic><Diagnostic tests><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Dreams><Dysautonomia-Orthostatic Hypotension Syndrome><Dysautonomic Orthostatic Hypotension><Eye Motility Disorders><Eye Movement Disorders><Feasibility Studies><Funding><Future><Health Care Costs><Health Costs><Healthcare Costs><Industry><Laboratories><Life Sciences><Location><Measurement><Measures><Methodology><Methods><Modeling><Morbidity><Morbidity - disease rate><Motor><Movement><Multiple System Atrophy><Multiple System Atrophy Syndrome><Multisystem Atrophy><Multisystemic Atrophy><NAC precursor><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Nerve Degeneration><Nerve Fibers><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neuraxis><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neurologist><Neurology><Neuron Degeneration><Ocular Motility Disorders><PARK1 protein><PARK4 protein><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Pathologic><Pathologist><Pathology><Patient Care><Patient Care Delivery><Patients><Pattern Recognition><Peripheral Nervous System><Persons><Phosphorylation><Pilot Projects><Primary Parkinsonism><Probability><Progressive Autonomic Failure><Protein Phosphorylation><Proteins><Public Health><Punch Biopsy><Pure Autonomic Failures><REM Behavior Disorder><REM Sleep Behavior Disorder><Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder><Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder><Reading><Reproducibility><Risk><SNCA><SNCA protein><Sensitivity and Specificity><Severity of illness><Shy-Drager Syndrome><Shy-Drager Type Idiopathic Orthostatic Hypotension><Staining method><Stains><Structure><Surrogate End Points><Surrogate Endpoint><Symptoms><Technology><Testing><Time><United States National Institutes of Health><Visual><a-syn><a-synuclein><aberrant folded protein><aberrant folded proteins><abnormal folded protein><abnormal folded proteins><accurate diagnostics><active followup><alpha synuclein><alpha synuclein gene><alphaSP22><artificial intelligence augmented><asyn><behavior disorder diagnosis><body movement><care for patients><care of patients><caring for patients><circulating biomarkers><circulating markers><companion diagnostics><cutaneous biopsy><deep learning algorithm><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><detection platform><detection system><develop therapy><developmental><diagnostic ability><diagnostic capability><diagnostic power><diagnostic tool><diagnostic utility><diagnostic value><digital><disease control><disease severity><disorder control><effective therapy><effective treatment><enhanced with AI><enhanced with Artificial Intelligence><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><imaging approach><imaging based approach><improved><innovate><innovation><innovative><intervention development><lab experience><lab training><laboratory experience><laboratory training><minimally invasive><misfolded protein><misfolded proteins><mortality><neural><neural degeneration><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neurodegenerative illness><neurological degeneration><neuronal degeneration><non A-beta component of AD amyloid><non A4 component of amyloid precursor><participant enrollment><patient enrollment><patient population><phase 2 study><phase II study><pilot study><proteotoxic protein><proteotoxin><public-private partnership><rapid eye movement><skin biopsy><success><synuclein><synucleinopathy><therapy development><treatment development><vocalization><whole slide imaging><α synuclein gene><α-syn><α-synuclein>,Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease; Sleep Research
Role of mitochondrial Complex I deficiency in Alzheimer disease and dementia,Role of mitochondrial Complex I deficiency in Alzheimer disease and dementia,"Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dementia present enormous social and economic burdens to the United States.
In 2019, AD was recognized as the sixth leading cause of death (121,499 cases) in the nation. The number of
AD cases within the country is predicted to rise to 13.8 million by the year 2060. Most cases are sporadic in
nature and their molecular causes remain unknown. A clinical report from last year suggests that the Complex I
deficiency may cause early onset AD in humans. This report linked a pathogenic mutation in the NDUFA1 gene,
which encodes an essential subunit of Complex I. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that Complex I
deficiency predisposes to AD and dementia by elevating neuroinflammation and proteinopathy. It may
also confer sex disparity in the disease susceptibility. To test this hypothesis, we propose studies with two
specific aims. Aim 1) will determine the effects of Complex I deficiency on humanized Aβ proteinopathy. Aim 2)
will determine the susceptibility of Complex I-deficient mice to AD and dementia. We will cross the Complex I-
deficient Ndufa1S55A mice with ApphAβ mice that express humanized amyloid beta (hAβ) to generate double
knock-in mice (Ndufa1S55A-ApphAβ). These mice Ndufa1S55A-ApphAβ will be used to determine predisposition to
AD and dementia in the presence and absence of humanized Aβ. Proteinopathy due to Aβ aggregation is one
of the hallmarks of AD. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will develop a real-time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC)
assay to quantify Aβ proteinopathic seeds present in brain and blood. In Aim 2, we will perform biochemical and
histopathological evaluation to assess the levels of Aβ plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation,
neuronal loss, and synaptic degeneration in mice brains. We will also assess cognitive decline by behavioral
assays for spatial learning and memory. We expect to demonstrate that Complex deficiency increases
susceptibility to AD and dementia in the presence of humanized Aβ. The outcome of this project will have a
significant impact on our understanding of the risks of AD and dementia, which can help in early diagnosis and
prevention.",<AD dementia><Active Oxygen><Age><Aging><Alleles><Allelomorphs><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer beta-Protein><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer risk factor><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimer's amyloid><Alzheimer's disease patient><Alzheimer's disease risk><Alzheimer's patient><Alzheimers Dementia><Amentia><Amyloid (Aβ) plaques><Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein><Amyloid Beta-Peptide><Amyloid Plaques><Amyloid Protein A4><Amyloid beta-Protein><Amyloid β><Amyloid β oligomer><Amyloid β-Peptide><Amyloid β-Protein><Assay><Aβ><AβO><Behavioral Assay><Bioassay><Biochemical><Biological Assay><Blood><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Body Tissues><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cause of Death><Cerebellum><Clinical><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Complex><Complex I Dehydrogenase><Country><Dementia><Development><Diathesis><Disease><Disease susceptibility><Disorder><Disturbance in cognition><EOAD><Early Diagnosis><Early Onset Alzheimer Disease><Economic Burden><Economics><Electron Transport Complex I><Embryo><Embryonic><Encephalon><Environmental Factor><Environmental Risk Factor><Epigenetic><Epigenetic Change><Epigenetic Mechanism><Epigenetic Process><Evaluation><Female><Genes><Genetic><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic defect><Goals><High Prevalence><Histopathology><Human><Impaired cognition><Impairment><In Vitro><Individual><KI mice><Knock-in Mouse><Knock-out><Knockout><Learning><Link><Memory><Meta-Analysis><Mice><Mice Mammals><Microtubule Depolymerization><Mitochondria><Mitochondrial complex I deficiency><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular><Murine><Mus><Mutation><NADH DH I><NADH Dehydrogenase Complex 1><NADH Dehydrogenase I><NADH Q1 Oxidoreductase><NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone)><NADH-CoQ Reductase><NADH-Coenzyme Q Reductase><NADH-Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase><NADH-Ubiquinone Reductase><Nature><Neuritic Plaques><Neurofibrillary Tangles><Outcome><Oxygen Radicals><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Pathogenesis><Pathogenicity><Patients><Population><Predisposition><Prevention><Preventive><Primary Parkinsonism><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Pro-Oxidants><Production><Proteins><Proteomics><Public Health><Reactive Oxygen Species><Reporting><Respiratory Chain><Respiratory Complex I><Rest><Risk><Role><Rotenone><Rotenone-Sensitive Mitochondrial NADH-Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase><Senile Plaques><Substantia Nigra><Substantia nigra structure><Susceptibility><Synapses><Synaptic><Testing><Therapeutic><Time><Tissues><Transcript><Ubiquinone Reductase><United States><X Chromosome><a beta peptide><abeta><abeta accumulation><abeta aggregation><abeta oligomer><age associated disease><age associated disorder><age associated impairment><age dependent disease><age dependent disorder><age dependent impairment><age related human disease><age-related disease><age-related disorder><age-related impairment><ages><alzheimer risk><amyloid beta><amyloid beta accumulation><amyloid beta aggregation><amyloid beta oligomer><amyloid beta plaque><amyloid β accumulation><amyloid β aggregation><amyloid-b plaque><amyloid-b protein><aβ accumulation><aβ aggregation><aβ oligomer><aβ plaques><beta amyloid fibril><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive loss><complex 1 dehydrogenase><cored plaque><dementia risk><developmental><differential expression><differentially expressed><diffuse plaque><disease causing variant><disease model><disease-causing mutation><disorder model><disparities in sex><early detection><early onset><early onset AD><early onset Alzheimer's><economic><environmental risk><epigenetically><genome mutation><improved><inhibitor><knockin mice><knockout gene><liability to disease><life span><lifespan><male><mitochondrial><mutant><nerve cell death><nerve cell loss><neural inflammation><neurofibrillary degeneration><neurofibrillary lesion><neurofibrillary pathology><neuroinflammation><neuroinflammatory><neuron cell death><neuron cell loss><neuron death><neuron loss><neuronal cell death><neuronal cell loss><neuronal death><neuronal loss><novel><oAβ><oligomeric amyloid beta><oligomeric amyloid-β><pathogenic variant><patient living with Alzheimer's disease><patient suffering from Alzheimer's disease><patient with Alzheimer's><patient with Alzheimer's disease><pharmacologic><primary degenerative dementia><risk factor for dementia><risk for dementia><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><sex disparity><social><social role><soluble amyloid precursor protein><synapse><tangle><transcriptional differences><trend><type 1 dehydrogenase>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Brain Disorders; Dementia; Genetics; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Prevention
CRCNS: Deconstructing ... - Diversity Research Supplement - Michael Silverangel,CRCNS: Deconstructing ... - Diversity Research Supplement - Michael Silverangel,"Project Summary
Motor cortex historically has been viewed as a relatively stable region of the brain, with static cortical dynamics mapping to
particular movements. Recent work has questioned these assumptions, asserting that the brain’s internal map of the external
world drifts over time. This phenomena, known as representational drift, may provide insight into how the brain adapts to
learn new behavior. Modeling representational drift and establishing its connection to motor learning are the primary aims
of this proposal.
Currently, there is no standardized metric to track representational drift over time. Leveraging our repository of motor and
premotor neuronal recordings, we look to establish a common framework for calculating the rate at which this drift occurs.
To do this, we will apply unbiased, probabilistic methods (e.g., continuous-time hidden Markov models, switching linear
dynamical systems) that extract discrete latent states to the neural data. Models will be evaluated based on ofﬂine decoding
performance, and drift will be calculated by the transition rate across latent states.
After establishing a common modeling framework, we will analyze how drift rates change across various motor tasks and
levels of exertion. To accomplish this, we will employ our novel, unconstrained recording platform, which allows for the
simultaneous capture of markerless kinematics and wirelessly transmitted neural data. By analyzing the neural data collected
during diverse movements, we can assess how both overall levels activity and different types of behavior impact rates of
representational drift.
By determining how physical activity impacts representational drift, we can better understand the relationship between drift
and rates of motor learning. To do this we will study to cohorts recovering from motor deﬁcit. One cohort will integrate drift-
enhancing activities during recovery and another will not. By monitoring rates of representational drift and motor recovery,
we can evaluate the effect that drift has on motor learning. This knowledge can then be leveraged to improve treatments for
those recovering from brain-related movement disorders, like stroke and Parkinson’s.","<Apoplexy><Automobile Driving><Behavior><Behavioral><Biologic Models><Biological Models><Brain><Brain Diseases><Brain Disorders><Brain Nervous System><Brain Vascular Accident><Brain region><CNS Nervous System><Central Nervous System><Cerebral Stroke><Cerebrovascular Apoplexy><Cerebrovascular Stroke><Chronic><Communities><Complex><Coupled><Creativeness><Data><Data Set><Development><Dimensions><Dyskinesia Syndromes><Educational process of instructing><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Encephalon><Encephalon Diseases><Exertion><Extremities><Goals><Head><Image><Intracranial CNS Disorders><Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders><Investigation><Joints><Knowledge><Learning><Limb structure><Limbs><Literature><Maps><Measurement><Measures><Methods><Mission><Model System><Modeling><Monitor><Motor><Motor Cell><Motor Cortex><Motor Neurons><Motor disability><Movement><Movement Disorder Syndromes><Movement Disorders><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neural Transmission><Neuraxis><Neurocyte><Neurons><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Neurosciences><Non-Trunk><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Performance><Persons><Phase><Physical activity><Population><Primary Parkinsonism><Recovery><Recurrence><Recurrent><Research><Research Proposals><STEM research><Standard Model><Standardization><Stroke><Synaptic Transmission><System><Teaching><Time><United States National Institutes of Health><Update><Walking><Work><awake><body movement><brain attack><brain control><brain machine interface><cerebral vascular accident><cerebrovascular accident><cohort><computational neuroscience><creativity><depository><developmental><driving><dynamic system><dynamical system><electrophysiological><high dimensionality><imaging><improved><insight><kinematic model><kinematics><locomotor learning><markov model><motoneuron><motor behavior><motor control><motor deficit><motor learning><motor recovery><multi-electrode arrays><multielectrode arrays><neural><neuronal><next generation><non-human primate><nonhuman primate><novel><operation><operations><programs><rate of change><repository><restraint><science, technology, engineering and math research><science, technology, engineering and mathematics research><stroked><strokes><wireless transmission>",Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Bioengineering; Brain Disorders; Neurosciences; Physical Rehabilitation; Rehabilitation
Characterizing the regulatory roles of microRNA on mitochondria in the mammalian CNS,Characterizing the regulatory roles of microRNA on mitochondria in the mammalian CNS,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neuronal tissue is the most energy consumptive tissue type of the entire body, and as such, depends heavily on
the health and proper regulation of its mitochondria, its main source of energy. Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction
is linked to a number of neuropsychiatric diseases, including the neurodevelopmental disorder Fragile X
Syndrome (FXS). FXS is characterized by loss of the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), an RNA-
binding protein that has been shown to interact with microRNAs (miRNAs) and components of the RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC). Interestingly, using an optimized Ago-CLIP method that unambiguously identifies
miRNA:target RNA interactions within the RISC, our lab has identified prevalent binding of miRNAs to
mitochondrial transcripts (mt-RNA) in the mammalian forebrain. Though mitochondrial dysfunction in FXS has
been identified, a connection with RISC and targeting of mt-RNA has not yet been explored. This proposal seeks
to further characterize the molecular underpinnings of these observed miRNA:mt-RNA interactions, as well as
their impact in both health and disease (FXS). Specific Aim 1 proposes to use the same optimized Ago-CLIP
method, termed CIMERAseq, to determine the subcellular compartment in which the miRNA:mt-RNA
interactions are occurring, as well as use a targeted approach to identify cell-type specificity of the transcript
interactions. Specific Aim 2 explores the possible functional effect of the observed binding by altering levels of
select miRNAs identified in our data and recording the effect in three ways: i) transcript abundance (via
sequencing and qPCR) ii) protein abundance (via Western blot and BN-PAGE), and iii) mitochondrial function
(via assessment of respiratory function, ATP synthesis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production). Aim 2
also uses the same effect readouts to investigate mitochondrial perturbations in a mouse model of FXS (Fmr1
KO). If successful, the proposed specific aims will aid in understanding the role of miRNAs as mitochondrial gene
regulators in the mammalian forebrain, both in health and disease. In addition to completion of the proposed
aims, this proposal outlines a training plan formulated specifically for my long-term goal of becoming a well-
rounded independent scientist. Training received through the course of this fellowship will focus on enhancing
my skills in molecular biology methods, bioinformatic methods, and scientific communication and writing. My
sponsor and university, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, are outstandingly equipped to not only
allow for completion of the proposed experiments but also to provide the resources needed to receive exceptional
training in the areas described. The Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology (BCMB) program in which I
am enrolled is dedicated to providing an exceptional training environment and will support completion of the
research plan as well as career training opportunities. This fellowship will support not only impactful research
toward understanding miRNA and mitochondria in FXS pathology, but also my development into a capable and
independent neuroscientist.",<21+ years old><AD dementia><ASD><ATP Synthesis><ATP Synthesis Pathway><Active Oxygen><Adult><Adult Human><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><Area><Autism><Autistic Disorder><Binding><Bio-Informatics><Biochemistry and Cellular Biology><Bioinformatics><Body Tissues><Brain><Brain Nervous System><CNS Nervous System><Cellular Regulation><Central Nervous System><Closure by Ligation><Communication><Cytoplasm><DNA Molecular Biology><Data><Dedications><Defect><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Dendritic Spines><Development><Disease><Disorder><Early Infantile Autism><Electron Transport><Encephalon><Energy-Generating Resources><Enrollment><Environment><Escalante syndrome><Evaluation><Event><Family><Fellowship><Fore-Brain><Forebrain><Fragile X><Fragile X Syndrome><Gene Action Regulation><Gene Expression><Gene Expression Regulation><Gene Regulation><Gene Regulation Process><Generalized Growth><Goals><Growth><Health><Huntington Chorea><Huntington Disease><Huntington's><Huntington's Disease><Huntingtons Disease><Immune Precipitation><Immunoblotting><Immunoprecipitation><Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons><Infantile Autism><Intermediary Metabolism><Investigation><Kanner's Syndrome><Ligation><Link><Martin-Bell Syndrome><Martin-Bell-Renpenning syndrome><Messenger RNA><Metabolic Processes><Metabolic dysfunction><Metabolism><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Micro RNA><MicroRNAs><Mitochondria><Mitochondrial Matrix><Molecular><Molecular Biology><Molecular Interaction><Murine><Mus><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Nervous System><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neural Cell><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural Development><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neuraxis><Neurocyte><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurodevelopmental Disorder><Neurologic Body System><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neurologic Disorders><Neurologic Organ System><Neurological Development Disorder><Neurological Disorders><Neuron from iPSC><Neuron from induced pluripotent stem cells><Neurons><Non-Polyadenylated RNA><Oxidative Phosphorylation><Oxidative Phosphorylation Pathway><Oxygen Radicals><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Pathology><Patients><Population><Primary Parkinsonism><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Pro-Oxidants><Production><Prosencephalon><Protein Subunits><Proteins><RISC Multicomponent Nuclease><RNA><RNA Gene Products><RNA-Binding Proteins><RNA-Induced Silencing Complex><Reactive Oxygen Species><Regulation><Regulator Genes><Renpenning syndrome 2><Reporting><Research><Research Resources><Resources><Respiratory physiology><Ribonucleic Acid><Role><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Scientist><Source><Specificity><Synaptic plasticity><Technology><Testing><Tissue Growth><Tissues><Training><Transcript><Transcriptional Regulatory Elements><Translations><Universities><Western Blotting><Western Immunoblotting><Writing><X-linked mental deficiency-megalotestes syndrome><X-linked mental retardation with fragile X syndrome><X-linked mental retardation-fragile site 1 syndrome><adulthood><autism spectral disorder><autism spectrum disorder><autism-fragile X (AFRAX) syndrome><autistic spectrum disorder><career><cell growth regulation><cell type><crosslink><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><dementia praecox><dendrite spine><developmental><electron transfer><energy source><enroll><excitatory neuron><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><fra(X) syndrome><fra(X)(28) syndrome><fra(X)(q27) syndrome><fra(X)(q27-28) syndrome><fragile X-mental retardation syndrome><fragile Xq syndrome><fragile site mental retardation 1><genome scale><genome-wide><genomewide><iPS neurons><iPSC derived-neurons><induced pluripotent stem cell neurons><mRNA><mRNA Translation><mRNP><macro-orchidism-marker X (MOMX) syndrome><macro-orchidism-marker X syndrome><mar(X) syndrome><marker X syndrome><medical college><medical schools><mental retardation-macroorchidism syndrome><messenger ribonucleoprotein><miRNA><miRNAs><mitochondrial><mitochondrial dysfunction><mitochondrial genome><mitochondrial mRNA><mitochondrial messenger RNA><mouse model><murine model><neurodegenerative illness><neurodevelopment><neurodevelopmental disease><neurological disease><neuronal><neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells><neuropsychiatric disease><neuropsychiatric disorder><ontogeny><primary degenerative dementia><programs><protein blotting><protein complex><regulatory gene><respiratory function><schizophrenic><school of medicine><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><skills><social role><training opportunity><trans acting element><translation>,Biotechnology;

Combining Chemical Biology and Machine Learning to Generate Reproducible Amyloid Fibrils,Combining Chemical Biology and Machine Learning to Generate Reproducible Amyloid Fibrils,"Project Summary
Aging related disorders, such as Parkinson's Disease with dementia (PDD), Lewy Body with Dementia, and other
Alzheimer Disease and related dementias (ADRDs), are debilitating neurological disorders that affect more than
8 million people in the US alone. Amyloid deposits, characterized by their insolubility and disruptive protein
clumps, pose a distinct challenge in structural biology and medicine due to their atypical structure compared to
soluble proteins. In PDD, the protein alpha-synuclein (αS) misfolds and aggregates into self-templating fibrils.
These fibrils consist of repeating beta-sheet units, capable of adopting various shapes and surface structures,
known as fibril morphologies (FMs). Ensuring consistent FM for in vitro assays remains a formidable challenge
across literature given the variability introduced by factors such as salt concentration, buffer selection, and
additive choices to name a few. These assays are vital for the assessment of compound binding and cellular
toxicity, yet no expedient assay has been created to rigorously determine FM. The University of Pennsylvania
(UPenn), sponsor, and principal investigator of this research proposal are uniquely positioned to accomplish the
goals outlined below. UPenn provides a robust infrastructure and extensive resources for groundbreaking
research, the sponsor contributes deep expertise in chemistry and biophysics, vital for the project's scientific
rigor, and the principal investigator, with extensive experience in the relevant areas of this research, is well-
equipped to lead and ensure the successful execution of the project.
The project proposed relies on the hypothesis that proteolytic cleavage rates of a fibril are determined by stability
of the fibril fold and enzyme steric clashes resulting in a specific kinetic proteolytic profile (KPP) which can
distinguish FMs. Current methods require laborious assays to pinpoint FM, and with FM often varying
unpredictably under identical preparations, the need is clear: a streamlined and efficient assay to guarantee
uniformity across samples and literature. Therefore, in Aim 1 introduces an assay that is designed to determine
FM by KPP. Pinpointing the FM is foundational to reproducibility and enables Aim 2: a statistically rigorous high-
throughput screen (HTS) for exploration into the diversity of possible FMs. The envisioned HTS utilizes site
selective chemistry via a cysteine to introduce mutations to the monomer structure of αS which is envisioned to
induce conformational change when fibrils are formed.
It is anticipated that a large FM library will be generated within the first few iterations which will not only expand
the collective knowledge of the FM manifold, or coverage of all possible FMs, but also enable the creation of
consistent preparations with specific features. Due to the number of potential combinations, Machine learning
(ML) will be employed to guide future iterations of this HTS. By addressing these challenges, the proposed
comprehensive MORFS assay, HTS, and ML will revolutionize the analysis of amyloids, paving the way for
reproducible in vitro assays for advancements in our collective understanding ADRDs.","<AD dementia><AD related dementia><ADRD><Acceleration><Acetylation><Address><Adopted><Affect><Affinity><Alzheimer

The Functional Role and Neural Basis of Rapid Turns in Olfactory Search Behavior,The Functional Role and Neural Basis of Rapid Turns in Olfactory Search Behavior,"Summary
When searching their environment for food, animals often switch from making random changes in direction to
reflexively orient upstream when they smell an attractive odor, followed by rhythmic turns when they lose the
plume. Random changes in direction are traditionally interpreted as manifestation of a stochastic search process.
In this proposal, we test new hypothesis for the role of these random turns: animals turn deliberately to gather
information before and after they change direction—allowing them to compute important internal and external
state parameters such as wind direction, wind speed, ground speed, and altitude that they cannot directly
measure. This idea is theoretically feasible based on the principle of observability, a powerful concept we borrow
from control theory and informatics that is critical in the design of autonomous vehicles; here, we apply it to
address fundamental questions in neuroscience. To do so, we exploit the natural behavior of flies, which execute
rapid turns (called body saccades) as they search during flight. Our research program exploits state-of-the-art
experimental techniques pioneered in the labs of team members, which we will leverage with genetic techniques
and the rapidly emerging connectome databases available to the fly community—an integrated approach that
has already provided our team with a solid foundation for our proposed effort. From wind tunnel experiments we
have discovered that hungry flies execute a brief, stereotyped turn when they first experience an odor stimulus,
which we postulate they use to estimate ambient wind direction and speed before either executing an upwind
surge, or initiating a circling behavior in still air. From physiology experiments, we discovered a small network of
identified cells that serve as command neurons for generating spontaneous saccades (DNa0X and DNb01) and
another, specialized neuron that regulates their execution during flight (VS041). These preliminary results
provide a strategic entry point for our proposed work, which is separated into four Specific Aims:
(1) Test whether DNa0X and DNb01 are responsible for saccades that mediate olfactory search.
(2) Identify upstream regulators of the saccade generating circuits responsible for the olfactory search behavior.
(3) Determine the role of spontaneous saccades in gathering information.
(4) Develop circuit-inspired, agent-based predictive models of olfactory search
This effort to elucidate the circuitry that controls both stimulus-evoked and spontaneous turns during olfactory
search and test their potential role in information-gathering links the ethologically important behavior of olfactory
search across spatial and temporal scales—from the transient responses of individual neurons to the long flight
trajectories of whole animals as they search for food. While not widely used in systems neuroscience, we believe
that the concept of observability will provide a major conceptual advance in understanding how brains function;
specifically, how the nervous system can collect information at different points in time and space and use it to
compute parameters that are for critical subsequent behavioral actions.","<2-photon><Address><Air><Altitude><Animals><Behavior><Behavioral><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cell Body><Cells><Communities><Complex><Computer Models><Computerized Models><Custom><Cyclicity><Data Bases><Databases><Down-Regulation><Encephalon><Ensure><Environment><Environmental Wind><Flies><Flying body movement><Food><Foundations><Functional Imaging><Generations><Genetic><Genetic Technics><Genetic Techniques><Gilles de la Tourette syndrome><Gilles de la Tourette's Disease><Goals><Guinon's disease><Human><Huntington Chorea><Huntington Disease><Huntington's><Huntington's Disease><Huntingtons Disease><Image><Informatics><Learning><Link><Literature><Maps><Measures><Mediating><Modeling><Modern Man><Motility><Motor><Movement><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Nervous System><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neurologic Body System><Neurologic Disorders><Neurologic Organ System><Neurological Disorders><Neurons><Neurosciences><Odors><Olfaction><Organism><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Periodicity><Physiologic Imaging><Physiology><Play><Primary Parkinsonism><Process><Regulation><Research><Rhythmicity><Role><Saccades><Saccadic Eye Movements><Saccadic Pursuit><Searching Behavior><Sensory><Smell><Smell Perception><Solid><Speed><Stereotyping><Stimulus><Symptoms><System><Techniques><Testing><Tic Disorder, Combined Vocal and Multiple Motor><Time><Tourette Syndrome><Tourette's><Tourette's Disease><Tourette's Disorder><Tourette's Syndrome><Visual><Wind><Work><body movement><computational modeling><computational models><computer based models><computer based prediction><computerized modeling><connectome><control theory><customs><data base><design><designing><experience><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><fly><flying><food environment><imaging><imaging system><individual response><individualized response><information gathering><instrument><living system><maladie des tics><member><neural><neurological disease><neuronal><odor perception><olfactory perception><optogenetics><physiological imaging><predictive modeling><programs><social role><statistics><theories><tic de Guinon><two-photon>",Aging; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Bioengineering; Neurosciences
Folding and Chaperone Interactions of Multi-domain Proteins,Folding and Chaperone Interactions of Multi-domain Proteins,"Project Summary
Combining several functional units, termed domains, into a single polypeptide chain is a common
evolutionary strategy for creating biological complexity. The resulting multi-domain proteins are
prevalent in all proteomes and carry out essential cellular functions. However, the increased functional
complexity of these large proteins complicates their folding into native functional structures. In contrast
to many smaller proteins or individual domains, multi-domain proteins are prone to misfolding and
potentially cytotoxic aggregation. In the cell, several factors ensure efficient folding. Folding begins co-
translationally, while the ribosome still synthesizes the polypeptide. Molecular chaperones begin to
interact with the nascent multi-domain protein as soon as it emerges from the ribosome. Co-
translational folding and chaperone interactions are recognized as crucial for efficient multi-domain
protein folding. However, these processes remain poorly defined at the molecular level, because it is
technically challenging to study them. The goal of this project is to define principles of co-translational
folding and chaperone function to better understand how complex multi-domain proteins robustly reach
their functional structures. We are using a combination of single-molecule biophysics and live-cell
experiments to accomplish this goal. With optical tweezers, we are studying the folding pathways of
nascent multi-domain proteins at the single-molecule level. Manipulation of individual molecules is
ideally suited to resolve complex folding pathways of nascent proteins, elucidate the contributions of
the ribosome and molecular chaperones to the folding process, and determine how co-translational
folding and protein synthesis are coupled and regulated to ensure robust outcomes. These detailed in
vitro studies are complemented by experiments in live cells that detect co-translational folding events
in multi-domain proteins. Protein misfolding and aggregation, misregulation of protein synthesis and
decline of chaperone function are hallmarks of many aging-related diseases. Our studies may ultimately
provide a mechanistic basis for discovering novel therapeutic strategies to treat some of these
diseases.",<3-D structure><3-dimensional structure><3D structure><AD dementia><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><Bacteria><Binding><Biological><Biology><Biophysics><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cancers><Cell Body><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Chaperone><Codon><Codon Nucleotides><Communication><Complex><Contracting Opportunities><Contracts><Coupled><Cultured Cells><Cytosol><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Detection><Disease><Disorder><Encephalon><Ensure><Eukaryota><Eukaryote><Event><Future><Geometry><Goals><In Vitro><Individual><Length><Link><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Measurement><Measures><Mechanics><Molecular><Molecular Chaperones><Molecular Interaction><Muscle><Muscle Tissue><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Cell><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurocyte><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neurons><Nutrient><Outcome><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Pathway interactions><Peptide Domain><Peptides><Peptidyl Transferases><Peptidyl Translocases><Peptidyltransferase><Primary Parkinsonism><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Process><Productivity><Property><Protein Biosynthesis><Protein Domains><Proteins><Proteome><Regulation><Resolution><Ribo-seq><Ribosomal Peptide Biosynthesis><Ribosomal Protein Biosynthesis><Ribosomal Protein Synthesis><Ribosomes><Role><Shapes><Structure><Subcellular Process><Tertiary Protein Structure><Translations><Transpeptidases><Variant><Variation><Work><Yeasts><aberrant protein folding><abnormal protein folding><aging associated disease><aging related disease><attenuation><biologic><biophysical foundation><biophysical principles><biophysical sciences><cytotoxic><defined contribution><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><detection method><detection procedure><detection technique><disease of aging><disorder of aging><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><in vivo><insight><insoluble aggregate><laser tweezer><malignancy><mechanic><mechanical><mechanical force><muscular><neoplasm/cancer><neurodegenerative illness><neuronal><new therapeutic approach><new therapeutic intervention><new therapeutic strategies><new therapy approaches><new treatment approach><new treatment strategy><novel therapeutic approach><novel therapeutic intervention><novel therapeutic strategies><novel therapy approach><optic tweezer><optical tweezers><overexpress><overexpression><pathologic protein folding><pathway><polypeptide><primary degenerative dementia><protein aggregate><protein aggregation><protein folding><protein homeostasis><protein misfolding><protein synthesis><proteostasis><reconstitute><reconstitution><resolutions><ribosome footprint profiling><ribosome profiling><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><single molecule><social role><three dimensional structure><translation>,Aging; Bioengineering; Neurosciences
"Microbiome, Environment, and Parkinsons disease (MEP) PESTICIDE EXPOSURES AND THE GUT MICROBIOME IN PARKINSONS DISEASE","Microbiome, Environment, and Parkinsons disease (MEP) PESTICIDE EXPOSURES AND THE GUT MICROBIOME IN PARKINSONS DISEASE","Abstract.
The human microbiome has a major role in the uptake and handling of nutrients, medications, and toxins; and is of great
immune system relevance. Evidence is mounting that it can affect aspects of neurologic function, brain activity, and
behavior via the ‘gut-brain-axis’. New propositions are that environmental exposures such as pesticides, metals, and
air pollution influence the microbiome and the human immune system and that the microbiome plays a role in
Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here we propose the novel hypothesis that a) the microbiome is affected by chronic
environmental exposures, specifically pesticides; and b) an altered gut microbiome composition or function contributes
to the progression of neurodegeneration in PD. PD - a progressive neurodegenerative disease – has various non-motor
symptoms including gastro-intestinal (GI) features such as constipation and gastroparesis. Its pathologic hallmarks,
namely Lewy bodies and α-synuclein aggregates, have been found in the gut’s enteric nervous system of PD patients
along with inflammation. The role of the gut microbiome in PD is underexplored and no study has addressed
whether toxins influence neurodegeneration via the microbiome. We previously developed a resource to investigate
long-term exposure to pesticides in humans, i.e. a geographic information system (GIS) model based on records from the
California state pesticide use reporting (PUR) system. Capitalizing on our unique PUR exposure assessment tool and
the Parkinson's Disease Susceptibility Genes and Pesticides Study (PEG; R01 ES-010544) resources, we have joined forces
with Drs. Mayer and Jacob (UCLA Division of Digestive Diseases) - experts in brain-gut connection microbiome research -
and propose to analyze the gut microbiome of 400 PD patients and 600 (200 age-matched household & 400 age-sex
matched community) controls using 16S ribosomal RNA to assess relative abundance of microbiota. Specifically, we will
assess composition and function (using the predicted metagenome) in pesticide exposed vs. non-exposed controls and
PD patients of different progression phenotypes. We will newly enroll 200 new-onset, of these 100 medication naïve
(MN) PD patients, to collect data on exposures, gut motility indicators, and fecal samples for metabolomics and culture
based experiments (before and after starting PD medications); assess differences in relative abundances of microbes
over time using 16S ribosomal RNA and shotgun metagenomics and conduct metabolomics (blood or stool) analyses for
new onset PD patients (twice, longitudinally) and their household controls. We combine for this research our extensive
expertise in pesticide exposure assessment and studying PD progression in community-based patients, an exceptionally
well-characterized population living in a heavily pesticide exposed region, with the expertise of our UCLA GI team in
brain-gut axis research and the resources of the UCLA microbiome core. Our resources provide a strong and efficient
platform for addressing chronic environmental exposure to pesticides and their impacts on the gut microbiome and on
neurodegeneration. This research will suggest novel pathways and prevention options for a growing elderly population
with chronic environmental exposures.","<Active Follow-up><Address><Affect><Age><Air Pollution><Animals><Area><Assessment instrument><Assessment tool><Behavior><Biologic Models><Biological><Biological

Substantia nigra circuits in instrumental action,Substantia nigra circuits in instrumental action,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and resulting
pathophysiology in basal ganglia circuits are central to the core motor impairments in Parkinson's Disease
(PD). A variety of non-motor symptoms also are highly prevalent in PD, including motivation-related deficits
manifesting as apathy, fatigue, and depression, which have significant negative impacts on quality of life for
patients and caregivers. However, we still have limited understanding of how nigrostriatal dopamine
contributes to specific aspects of motivated behavior spanning action selection and invigoration, particularly in
the context of cost-benefit decisions entailing effortful reward seeking. Recent work has increasingly
highlighted a remarkable diversity of midbrain dopamine neurons, and indeed some subpopulations of SNc
dopamine neurons are preferentially vulnerable in PD. Defining the circuits regulating distinct nigrostriatal
dopamine projections and determining their subtype-specific roles in motivated behavior will address critical
knowledge gaps and represents important first steps toward developing more effective and specific treatments
for disorders such as PD. Our preliminary data suggest that manipulating afferent inputs can drive highly
divergent responses in different nigrostriatal dopamine projections. In particular, stimulating subthalamic
nucleus glutamatergic neurons drives diametrically opposed responses in nigrostriatal dopamine projections to
distinct striatal subregions. Additionally, stimulating different populations of descending striatonigral projections
evokes opposing patterns of dopamine release within the same region of the striatum. However, the circuit
interactions underlying these divergent effects remain unknown. Beyond its recognized role as a major basal
ganglia output nucleus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) provides critical inhibitory regulation of SNc
dopamine neurons, and we propose that this may differ between dopamine neuron subtypes and mediate their
divergent responses to other basal ganglia afferent inputs. Given the anatomically segregated projections of
SNc dopamine neuron subtypes to different striatal subregions, we will test the hypothesis that these dopamine
subpopulations differentially contribute to dissociable aspects of effortful reward-seeking behavior. The major
goals of this proposal are therefore 1) to characterize how SNr GABA neurons regulate divergent nigrostriatal
dopamine pathways and potentially mediate pathway-specific responses to distinct afferent inputs, and 2) to
determine the roles of these SNc dopamine neuron subpopulations in effort-based decisions and instrumental
action invigoration. Collectively this research program will yield important advances in understanding basal
ganglia circuit regulation of diverse dopamine neuron subtypes and their contributions to motivated behaviors
often impacted in PD.",<4-Aminobutanoic Acid><4-Aminobutyric Acid><4-amino-butanoic acid><Ablation><Address><Aminalon><Aminalone><Anatomic Sites><Anatomic structures><Anatomy><Basal Ganglia><Basal Nuclei><Behavior><Behavior assessment><Behavioral><Bradykinesia><Care Givers><Caregivers><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Nucleus><Cell Signaling><Corpus Striatum><Corpus striatum structure><Costs and Benefits><DA Neuron><Data><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Disease><Disease Progression><Disorder><Dopamine><Dopamine neuron><Dysfunction><Evaluation><Exertion><Exhibits><Fatigue><Fiber><Functional disorder><GABA><Glutamates><Goals><Hydroxytyramine><Impairment><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Knowledge><L-Glutamate><Lack of Energy><Learning><Measures><Mediating><Mental Depression><Mesencephalon><Mice><Mice Mammals><Mid-brain><Midbrain><Midbrain structure><Motivation><Movement><Murine><Mus><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Cell><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurocyte><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neuromodulator><Neurons><Nucleus><Nucleus Subthalamicus><Outcome><Output><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Pathway interactions><Patients><Pattern><Photometry><Physiopathology><Population><Primary Parkinsonism><QOL><Quality of life><Regulation><Research><Rewards><Role><STN stimulation><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Specificity><Stimulus><Striate Body><Striatum><Structure of subthalamic nucleus><Substantia Nigra><Substantia nigra structure><Subthalamic Nucleus><Symptoms><Task Performances><Testing><Tremor><Viral><Work><behavioral assessment><biological signal transduction><body movement><cell type><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><depression><dopaminergic neuron><effective therapy><effective treatment><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><gamma-Aminobutyric Acid><gene manipulation><genetic approach><genetic manipulation><genetic strategy><genetically manipulate><genetically perturb><glutamatergic><in vivo><insight><motivated behavior><motor deficit><motor impairment><movement impairment><movement limitation><neural><neural circuit><neural circuitry><neurocircuitry><neurodegenerative illness><neuronal><non-motor symptom><nonmotor symptom><novel><optogenetics><pars compacta><pathophysiology><pathway><programs><response><segregation><sensor><social role><striatal><subthalamic nucleus stimulation><synaptic circuit><synaptic circuitry><tool><γ-Aminobutyric Acid>,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Depression; Mental Health; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease
Molecular and Circuit Mechanisms of Neurexin1-Mediated Goal-Directed Dysfunction,Molecular and Circuit Mechanisms of Neurexin1-Mediated Goal-Directed Dysfunction,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Studies in humans suggest that Neurexin1α (Nrxn1α), a presynaptically expressed organizer of synaptic
structure, is a key genetic risk factor for multiple neuropsychiatric diseases, all of which exhibit impairments in
goal-directed processing. Given the pernicious effects of goal-directed dysfunction on daily quality of life, a better
understanding of the underlying neurobiology – both at the molecular and neural circuit level - is strongly
warranted. Our prior work has developed quantitative behavioral and in vitro electrophysiological approaches
while demonstrating that mice with mutations in Nrxn1α are an excellent system to study alterations in neural
circuit activity driving impaired goal-directed behavior. Efficient goal-directed behavior relies on reinforcement,
whereby outcomes shape future actions, as well as flexibility, the ability to adapt to changes in contingencies or
context. Both processes are thought to occur in part within the striatum, where excitatory inputs representing
choice-relevant information interact with neuromodulators, such as dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh),
which signal information about rewards, surprise, and uncertainty from the external world. Nrxn1 is broadly
expressed in these cortico-striatal-thalamic circuits including the presynaptic terminals of striatal-targeting
cortical and thalamic neurons, as well as within striatal cholinergic interneurons and striatal-targeting
dopaminergic projections from the midbrain. Here we examine how Nrxn1 functions within midbrain dopamine
neurons and striatal cholinergic interneurons, the major sources of striatal dopamine and acetylcholine,
respectively. We employ cell type specific Nrxn1 deletion together with acute slice recordings to mechanistically
address how Nrxn1 contributes to the striatal release of these key neuromodulators. In parallel, we use in vivo
imaging of novel sensors for dopamine and acetylcholine to investigate how these modulators are altered during
value-based choice tasks in both circuit-specific and brain-wide Nrxn1 KOs. We will correlate abnormal
neuromodulatory signals with abnormalities in choice behavior, focusing on reinforcement processes and choice
flexibility. To probe the functional relevance of altered neuromodulatory signals for behavior, we optogenetically
impose abnormal ACh and DA signals in WT mice and observe impacts on choice selection and flexibility. Finally,
we examine how Nrxn1 mutations impact striatal processing during selection of actions via in vivo recordings

Revealing the complexity of dis-inhibitory circuitries,Revealing the complexity of dis-inhibitory circuitries,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Salient signals, like aversive stimulation and reward, should be faithfully detected, and processed by the
nervous system to generate an adaptive action. One of the universal circuit mechanisms linked to salient signal
processing in cortical operation is the activation of dis-inhibitory neurons by subcortical afferents. Aversive
signals and reward delivery profoundly excite cortical GABAergic interneurons expressing vasoactive intestinal
polypeptide (VIP), which selectively inhibit other GABAergic interneurons, leading to the dis-inhibition of
cortical pyramidal cells. In this project, we propose to reveal the functional diversity of VIP interneurons in a
cortical structure. The central idea of our project rests on our earlier anatomical findings that distinct groups of
VIP interneurons innervate different types of GABAergic interneurons, observations that prompted us to
suggest a heterogeneity in their activity during various cortical processes. However, recent imaging studies
reported rather similar activity of VIP interneurons following aversive and appetitive stimuli. In contrast to these
in vivo imaging data, our preliminary experiments obtained in a frontal cortical area of anesthetized mice have
revealed a considerable heterogeneity in VIP interneuron spiking upon delivery of foot shocks. Building on
these preliminary results, our goal is to determine the functional complexity of cortical VIP interneurons,
including their connectivity and operation in awake mice. To achieve these aims, we will combine viral
techniques, neuroanatomical methods, in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology with optogenetics in three different
genetically modified mouse lines. The results of this project will uncover the heterogeneity of spike responses
generated by genetically defined dis-inhibitory VIP interneurons upon salient signal delivery and their
downstream effects on postsynaptic partners within the local microcircuits. Our project will reveal the
complexity of dis-inhibitory circuit motifs in cortical networks, which may be a general phenomenon in a cortex-
wide manner. In addition, our results will help form novel concepts underlying the pathological operation of
cortical circuits linked to deficits in attention and salient signal detection that typifies many malfunctional
cognitive processes, including those observed in schizophrenia, autism, and attention deficit.",<ASD><Anatomic Sites><Anatomic structures><Anatomy><Anesthesia><Anesthesia procedures><Appetite><Area><Attention><Attentional deficit><Autism><Autistic Disorder><Aversive Stimulus><BAC clone><BACs><Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes><Basal Transcription Factor><Basal transcription factor genes><CCK><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cholecystokinin><Circulatory Collapse><Coin><Connector Neuron><Data><Desire for food><Detection><Disinhibition><Early Infantile Autism><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Elements><Epilepsy><Epileptic Seizures><Epileptics><Fire - disasters><Fires><Gene Modified><General Transcription Factor Gene><General Transcription Factors><Goals><Head><Heterogeneity><In Vitro><Infantile Autism><Intercalary Neuron><Intercalated Neurons><Interneurons><Internuncial Cell><Internuncial Neuron><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Kanner's Syndrome><Learning><Link><Memory><Mental disorders><Mental health disorders><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Murine><Mus><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Nervous System><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neural Cell><Neuranatomies><Neuranatomy><Neuroanatomies><Neuroanatomy><Neurocyte><Neurologic Body System><Neurologic Disorders><Neurologic Organ System><Neurological Disorders><Neurons><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Output><PHM27><Pancreozymin><Pathologic><Pattern><Population><Process><Psychiatric Disease><Psychiatric Disorder><Pyramidal Cells><Pyramidal neuron><Reporting><Rest><Rewards><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Seizure Disorder><Shock><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Stimulus><Structure><Techniques><Testing><Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene><Transcription factor genes><Transgenic Mice><Uropancreozymin><Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide><Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide><Vasointestinal Peptide><Viral><Visual><attentive deficit><autism spectral disorder><autism spectrum disorder><autistic spectrum disorder><awake><biological signal transduction><circulatory shock><cognitive process><dementia praecox><electrophysiological><epilepsia><epileptogenic><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><fire><foot><frontal cortex><frontal lobe><gene modification><genetically modified><hippocampal pyramidal neuron><imaging in vivo><imaging study><in vivo><in vivo imaging><information processing><mental illness><neurological disease><neuronal><novel><operation><operations><optogenetics><postsynaptic><psychiatric illness><psychological disorder><response><schizophrenic><shocks><signal processing><transcription factor>,Mental Health; Neurosciences
External Facilitation to Increase Prescribing of AUD Medications in the Psychiatric Setting,External Facilitation to Increase Prescribing of AUD Medications in the Psychiatric Setting,"ABSTRACT
 Patients with major mental illness (MMI; major depressive, bipolar, schizophrenia spectrum, other psychotic
disorders; posttraumatic stress disorder) are diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (AUD) at higher rates than the
general population and experience negative consequences and long-term suffering as a result. There are FDA
approved medications for AUD (MAUD) that have demonstrated efficacy. That these medications are underutilized in
MMI patients with comorbid AUD represents a gap in care: evidence-based AUD treatments exist but MMI patients –
many from marginalized racial, ethnic, and SES groups - are largely excluded from benefiting from them. In primary
care and mental health settings, prescribers report that MAUD is best provided in specialty addictions service settings
even though it is hard to connect with these services for MMI patients. However, the psychiatric treatment setting can
easily offer MAUD. Many MMI patients are highly connected to their psychiatry treatment providers. They are taking
psychiatric medications prescribed by their psychiatry treatment team; MAUD could easily be offered and monitored in
this context. APA practice guidelines state that MAUD can have efficacy outside of specialty addictions services.
Services in psychiatry treatment settings are provided by a team in which prescribers focus on medication treatments
in brief monthly appointments and non-prescribing clinicians provide psychosocial interventions in more frequent
appointments. Implementing a process that identifies patients, educates them on MAUD, prescribes MAUD and
monitors use, and integrates MAUD with other psychotherapies offers the best chance for increasing MMI patients’
access to MAUD.
 This project will pilot test an implementation facilitation (IF) intervention to increase MAUD education and
prescribing for MMI/AUD patients in three psychiatry treatment clinics. Guided by the integrated Promoting Action on
Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework, an external facilitator will work with each clinics’
internal champion to (1) provide clinic level education on MAUD in non-specialty care settings, (2) provide clinic level
training in using a standardized AUD screen, documenting screening results in the EHR, and documenting AUD
diagnosis in the EHR, (3) help internal champions use an audit and feedback system for weekly review of MAUD
education and prescribing, (4) help internal champions do weekly care coordination of MMI/AUD patients, and (5)
make educational materials on MAUD available on site to MMI patients so they are informed about these treatment
options. Internal champions and clinics will have access to consultation from a MAUD clinician expert. These activities
will take place across pre-implementation and implementation phases and will be followed by a post-IF sustainment
period during which clinics and champions continue implementation on their own. Formative Evaluation activities will
take place throughout; at the end of the sustainment phase, MAUD outcomes will be assessed.",<Address><Adopted><Affect><Affective Disorders><Appointment><Caring><Clinic><Collaborations><Consultations><Data><Diagnosis><Drug Prescribing><Drug Prescriptions><Drug Therapy><Drugs><Education><Educational Achievement><Educational Materials><Educational Status><Educational aspects><Emotional Depression><Environment><Ethnic Origin><Ethnicity><Evidence based practice><Exclusion><FDA approved><Feedback><Fostering><General Population><General Public><Health Care Providers><Health Personnel><Healthcare Providers><Healthcare worker><Hospitals><Individual><Interpersonal Interaction><Interpersonal Relations><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Knowledge><Learning><Literature><Major Mental Illness><Medication><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Modification><Monitor><Mood Disorders><NIAAA><National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism><Outcome><PARiHS framework><PTSD><Patient Education><Patient Instruction><Patient Training><Patients><Persons><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Pharmacotherapy><Phase><Physicians><Post-Traumatic Neuroses><Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders><Posttraumatic Neuroses><Practice Guidelines><Primary Care><Problem Solving><Process><Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework><Psychiatric therapeutic procedure><Psychiatrist><Psychiatry><Psychological Health><Psychotherapy><Psychotic Disorders><Qualitative Methods><Race><Races><Recovery><Reporting><Research><Role><Screening Result><Service setting><Services><Site><Specialty><Standardization><System><Testing><Training><Treatment outcome><Work><addiction><addictive disorder><alcohol abuse therapy><alcohol abuse treatment><alcohol co-morbidity><alcohol comorbidity><alcohol treatment><alcohol use disorder><care coordination><co-morbid><co-morbidity><co-occurring disorders><comorbidity><consultation><coordinating care><depression symptom><depressive><depressive symptoms><disparity in health><drug treatment><drug/agent><dual diagnosis><educational level><ethanol use disorder><evidence base><experience><formative assessment><formative evaluation><health care personnel><health care worker><health disparity><health provider><health workforce><healthcare personnel><implementation facilitation><implementation strategy><improved><interpersonal relationship><interventional strategy><marginalization><medical personnel><medical specialties><medication prescription><pilot test><post implementation><post-trauma stress disorder><posttrauma stress disorder><prescribed medication><programs><provider barriers><provider-level barriers><psychiatric care><psychiatric therapy><psychiatric treatment><psychosocial><psychotic illness><qualitative reasoning><racial><racial background><racial origin><response><routine care><schizophrenia spectrum><schizophrenia spectrum disorder><social role><social stigma><stigma><strategies for implementation><training achievement><training level><training status><traumatic neurosis><treatment provider>,"Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Dissemination and Implementation Research; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Health Services; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Substance Misuse"
Proof of concept: diclofenac as a KMO inhibitor in AUD,Proof of concept: diclofenac as a KMO inhibitor in AUD,"Summary
 The development of efficacious medications for AUD remains a high research priority with current emphases
on identifying novel molecular targets and efficiently screening new compounds. Pharmacological modulation of the
kynurenine pathway (KP) represents a promising novel target for AUD. The KP is a complex enzymatic cascade with
each step producing biologically active metabolites that are critically involved in diverse physiological and pathological
processes. Chronic alcohol exposure produces dysregulation of the KP, particularly as evidenced by decreased levels
of the neuroprotective metabolite kynurenic acid (KYNA) and increased levels of the neurotoxic metabolite quinolinic
acid (QUIN). This metabolic shift is associated with various alcohol-related pathologies in animals and humans. Thus,
a medication that targets the KP to restore KYNA and attenuate QUIN levels may be an effective treatment for AUD.
The enzyme kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) is a major gatekeeper of the KP and resultant KYNA levels. KMO
inhibition shifts the KP towards KYNA production in brain and away from QUIN production. Critically, KMO inhibition in
rodents, through its increase in brain KYNA levels, decreases alcohol self-administration, preference, cue-reactivity,
and relapse behaviors. However, KMO-inhibitors have not been tested in humans because of presumed lack of
availability. Diclofenac is an FDA-approved Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug that was recently discovered to
inhibit KMO activity. Consistent with KMO inhibition, diclofenac increases KYNA levels in the brain and periphery of
rodents. However, it remains unknown whether diclofenac increases KYNA levels and affects alcohol-related
behaviors in humans at approved, safe dosages. In a Phase Ia/b proof of concept study, we will test the
pharmacological mechanism, optimal dosing, tolerability, and initial efficacy of diclofenac as a potential novel
treatment for AUD. We will conduct a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalating, placebo-controlled, cross-over study
in which individuals with AUD (n=24) complete four sessions where they receive diclofenac (25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg)
or placebo. Our primary aim is to identify the dose by which diclofenac, vs. placebo, produces changes to the KP
indicative of KMO inhibition (e.g., increasing KYNA levels). We will also assess whether diclofenac, vs. placebo,
decreases tonic alcohol craving and negative mood, attenuates alcohol cue-reactivity, and improves cognitive
function. Findings will inform subsequent studies testing diclofenac for AUD as well as other disorders for which KMO
inhibition has been identified as a pharmacological target of interest.","<2,3-Pyridinedicarboxylic acid><Affect><Agonist><Alcohol Chemical Class><Alcohol Drinking><Alcohol consumption><Alcohols><Analgesic and Antipyretic><Animals><Anti-Inflammatories><Anti-Inflammatory Agents><Anti-inflammatory><Anticonvulsant Agent><Anticonvulsant Drugs><Anticonvulsants><Anticonvulsive Agents><Anticonvulsive Drugs><Attenuated><Behavior><Bipolar Affective Psychosis><Bipolar Disorder><Blood><Blood Plasma><Blood Reticuloendothelial System><Body Tissues><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cannabinoids><Chronic><Cocaine><Complex><Convulsants><Cross-Over Studies><Crossover Studies><Cues><Development><Dichlofenal><Diclofenac><Dicrofenac><Disease><Disorder><Dopamine><Dose><Double-Blind Method><Double-Blind Study><Double-Blinded><Double-Masked Method><Double-Masked Study><Drugs><Dysfunction><Emotional><Encephalon><Enzyme Gene><Enzyme Inhibition><Enzymes><EtOH drinking><EtOH use><FDA approved><Functional disorder><Gatekeeping><Human><Hydroxytyramine><Individual><K3H enzyme><Kynurenic Acid><Kynurenine><Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase><L-kynurenine-3-hydroxylase><Major Depressive Disorder><Manic-Depressive Psychosis><Measures><Medication><Mental disorders><Mental health disorders><Metabolic><Modern Man><Molecular Target><N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors><N-Methylaspartate Receptors><NIAAA><NMDA Receptor-Ionophore Complex><NMDA Receptors><NSAIDs><National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism><Neurobiology><Nicotine><Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors><Nicotinic Receptors><Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents><Nucleus Accumbens><Organism-Level Process><Organismal Process><Pathologic Processes><Pathological Processes><Pathology><Pathway interactions><Patients><Peripheral><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Pharmacological Treatment><Phase><Physiologic Processes><Physiological Processes><Physiopathology><Placebo Control><Placebos><Plasma><Plasma Serum><Production><Property><Prostaglandin Inhibition><Proxy><Psychiatric Disease><Psychiatric Disorder><Quinolinic Acid><Randomized><Receptor Protein><Relapse><Reporting><Research Priority><Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma><Rodent><Rodentia><Rodents Mammals><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Self Administered><Self Administration><Severities><Sham Treatment><Testing><Tissues><Up-Regulation><Upregulation><Voltaren><addiction><addictive disorder><alcohol abuse therapy><alcohol abuse treatment><alcohol behavior><alcohol craving><alcohol cue><alcohol effect><alcohol exposed><alcohol exposure><alcohol induced behavior><alcohol ingestion><alcohol intake><alcohol product use><alcohol related behavior><alcohol related cue><alcohol seeking><alcohol seeking behavior><alcohol treatment><alcohol use><alcohol use disorder><alcoholic beverage consumption><alcoholic drink intake><alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites><alpha-bungarotoxin receptor><alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor><alpha7nAChR><antagonism><antagonist><attenuate><attenuates><behavior test><behavioral test><bipolar affective disorder><bipolar disease><bipolar illness><bipolar mood disorder><clinical depression><cocaine seeking><cognitive assessment><cognitive function><cognitive performance><cognitive testing><craving><cue reactivity><dementia praecox><developmental><dosage><drug development><drug/agent><effective therapy><effective treatment><ethanol behavior><ethanol consumption><ethanol craving><ethanol cue><ethanol drinking><ethanol effect><ethanol exposed><ethanol exposure><ethanol induced behavior><ethanol ingestion><ethanol intake><ethanol product use><ethanol related behavior><ethanol seeking><ethanol use><ethanol use disorder><ethanol-seeking behavior><exposed to alcohol><exposed to ethanol><exposure to alcohol><exposure to ethanol><extracellular><gatekeeper><improved><inhibitor><interest><kynurenine 3-hydroxylase><kynurenine hydroxylase><major depression><major depression disorder><manic depressive disorder><manic depressive illness><mental illness><negative mood><neurobiological><neuroprotection><neuroprotective><neurotoxic><new approaches><nicotine self-administration><non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs><novel><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><pathophysiology><pathway><pharmacologic><placebo controlled><pre-clinical><preclinical><preference><psychiatric illness><psychological disorder><randomisation><randomization><randomly assigned><receptor><schizophrenic><screening><screenings><seizure drug><seizure medication><sham therapy><side effect><substance misuse><symptomatology><α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor><α7nAChR>","Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Mental Health; Neurosciences; Substance Misuse"
Brain-region-specific humanized cortical interneuron mice,Brain-region-specific humanized cortical interneuron mice,"Abstract
GABAergic cortical interneurons (cINs) play critical roles in balancing, synchronizing, and gating brain activity
by inhibiting other neurons. Their malfunction, especially those of medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived
cINs, has been associated with various neurodevelopmental brain disorders, such as schizophrenia (SCZ) and
autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Considering the fact that the divergence between human brains and rodent
brains has resulted in the failure of many central nervous system (CNS) therapeutics validated in rodent
models, it is critical to study human neurons to better understand the mechanisms of these cIN-associated
brain disorders. Human fetal brain tissues are not accessible for mechanistic studies, but we have developed a
method to efficiently generate homogeneous populations of MGE-type human cINs from pluripotent stem cells
(PSCs) of healthy or diseased subjects. We have extensively characterized them and demonstrated their
authenticity and functionality, making it possible to study the converging functional consequences of complex
genetics in real patient neurons, which cannot be studied in mouse neurons due to a lack of conservation of
non-coding regions, where most of risk loci are present. However, in vitro cultured neurons lack other critical
components of the brain environment, such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and blood vessels,
which can significantly impact their function. There have been efforts to optimize in vitro culture systems to
better recapitulate in vivo physiological environments by adding other brain cellular components, but there are
still limitations as to how closely they can simulate in vivo situations. To resolve this issue, in our previous
study, we pioneered human neuron-mouse brain chimeras to study the function of human SCZ neurons in
physiological environments. Although we were able to successfully identify SCZ cIN-intrinsic connectivity
deficits in mouse brains, we were not able to analyze the impacts of grafted neurons on brain circuits and
behaviors due to the presence of healthy mouse neurons in the grafted mice. Thus, in this proposed study, we
will perform brain-region-specific cIN-ablation in NodScid gamma (NSG) mice, followed by the replacement of
ablated host cINs with human cINs to generate region-specific humanized cIN chimeras. Based on previous
studies, including ours, that show successful restoration of compromised mouse inhibition by grafted human
cINs, these mice will allow us to analyze the functional impacts of grafted human cINs on the brain circuits and
behaviors in physiological in vivo environments. This novel physiological model system will help us tease apart
cell-type- and brain-region-specific disease mechanisms for complex brain disorders, and aid in developing
novel therapeutics.",<ASD><Ablation><Address><Ammon Horn><Area><Astrocytes><Astrocytus><Astroglia><Autism><Autistic Disorder><Behavior><Behavioral><Behavioral Assay><Biologic Models><Biological Models><Blood Vessels><Brain><Brain Diseases><Brain Disorders><Brain Nervous System><Brain region><CNS Nervous System><Cell Culture Techniques><Central Nervous System><Chimera><Chimera organism><Complex><Connector Neuron><Cornu Ammonis><Data><Development><Disease><Disorder><Dorsal><Dose><Early Infantile Autism><Electrodes><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Encephalon><Encephalon Diseases><Environment><Failure><Functional RNA><Future><Genetic><Graft Survival><Hippocampus><Histologic><Histologically><Hortega cell><Human><Immunohistochemistry><Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue><Immunohistochemistry Staining Method><In Vitro><Infantile Autism><Injections><Intercalary Neuron><Intercalated Neurons><Interneuron function><Interneurons><Internuncial Cell><Internuncial Neuron><Intracranial CNS Disorders><Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders><Kanner's Syndrome><Medial><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Microglia><Model System><Modeling><Modern Man><Murine><Mus><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neuraxis><Neurocyte><Neurons><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Non-Coding><Non-Coding RNA><Non-translated RNA><Noncoding RNA><Nontranslated RNA><Oligodendrocytes><Oligodendrocytus><Oligodendroglia><Oligodendroglia Cell><Pathogenesis><Patients><Phenotype><Physiologic><Physiological><Play><Pluripotent Stem Cells><Population><Prefrontal Cortex><Progenitor Cells><Qualifying><Regulation><Risk-associated variant><Rodent><Rodent Model><Rodentia><Rodents Mammals><Role><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Slice><Source><Synapses><Synaptic><System><Testing><Therapeutic><Titrations><Transplantation><Untranslated RNA><Viral Vector><astrocytic glia><autism spectral disorder><autism spectrum disorder><autistic spectrum disorder><cell culture><cell cultures><cell type><chimeras><cognitive assessment><cognitive function><cognitive task><cognitive testing><dementia praecox><developmental><disease mechanisms study><electrophysiological><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><gitter cell><hiPSC><hippocampal><human disease><human fetal brain tissue><human iPS><human iPSC><human induced pluripotent cell><human induced pluripotent stem cells><human inducible stem cells><iPS><iPSC><iPSCs><in vivo><in vivo Model><induced human pluripotent stem cells><induced pluripotent cell><induced pluripotent stem cell><inducible pluripotent stem cell><mesoglia><microglial cell><microgliocyte><neuronal><neuropsychiatric disease><neuropsychiatric disorder><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new therapeutics><new therapy><next generation therapeutics><noncoding><novel><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><optogenetics><perivascular glial cell><physiologic model><pluripotent progenitor><restoration><risk allele><risk gene><risk genotype><risk loci><risk locus><risk variant><schizophrenic><social role><stem cells><synapse><transplant><vascular>,Mental Health; Neurosciences; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - Human
Developmental mechanisms underlying visual and auditory topographic map alignment and accurate spatial orienting behavior,Developmental mechanisms underlying visual and auditory topographic map alignment and accurate spatial orienting behavior,"Across species, multisensory integration (MSI) is used to accurately and rapidly localize objects in
the environment. This process is presumed to rely on the correct organization of sensory inputs into
topographically aligned maps of egocentric space. However this idea has not been rigorously tested.
MSI and spatial orienting behaviors are compromised in many developmental disorders including
Autism, Schizophrenia and ADHD, highlighting the significance of understanding the developmental
mechanisms that establish effective MSI-dependent behaviors.
 The overall objective of this application is to determine the mechanisms used to integrate visual and
auditory maps of location in the mouse superior colliculus (SC) and identify the behavioral
consequences to animals deficient in these mechanisms. The central hypothesis is that sensory
experience is used to align auditory and visual maps of space in the SC; furthermore, accurate
alignment of the two maps is required for effective MSI and robust natural spatial orienting behavior.
Aim 1 seeks to determine both the developmental window in which MSI forms and the critical period
of sensory influence. We will present a wake mice with spatially restricted visual and auditory stimuli
while recording neuronal responses in the SC using high-density probes. Analyzing this data will
determine the spatial receptive fields (RFs) of visual, auditory and visual/auditory multimodal neurons.
This will be done at key developmental stages plus or minus visual or auditory deprivation.
 The goal of Aim 2 is to quantify how developmental changes in multisensory experience alter
natural stimulus localization behaviors. Mice innately hunt insects and their ability to capture them is
most efficient when they have access to multisensory cues. Of note, orienting behavior during prey
capture is disrupted in mouse models of ASD. Prey capture behaviors such as time to cricket detection,
spatial accuracy and precision of pursuit, and time to capture success will be measured in mice at
different ages and in those deprived of early vision or audition. This aim will reveal the role that sensory
experience plays in generating natural localization behavior.
 Experiments in Aim 3 will test the longstanding hypothesis that the alignment and integration of
visual and auditory inputs in the SC rely on the visual map as a template. We will record the auditory and
visual response properties as in Aim 1 from two populations of mice: those with scrambled or duplicated
visual map topography via perturbations in EphA/ephrin-A signaling or shifted via prism goggles. We can
then determine if the auditory map rearranges to align and integrate with the duplicated, scrambled or
shifted visual map and, if so, how these changes lead to altered orienting behavior during prey capture.",<21+ years old><AD/HD><ADHD><ASD><Acoustic Stimulation><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><Age><Animals><Anterior Quadrigeminal Body><Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder><Auditory><Auditory Stimulation><Autism><Autistic Disorder><Barn Owls><Behavior><Behavioral><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cats><Cats Mammals><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Complex><Crickets><Cues><Data><Detection><Development><Domestic Cats><Early Infantile Autism><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Encephalon><Environment><Eph Receptor Ligands><Ephrins><Eye><Eyeball><Feline Species><Felis catus><Felis domestica><Felis domesticus><Felis sylvestris catus><Generalized Growth><Goals><Goggles><Growth><Gryllidae><Head><Hearing><Individual><Infantile Autism><Insecta><Insects><Insects Invertebrates><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigation><Investigators><Kanner's Syndrome><Knowledge><Link><Location><Maps><Measures><Mesencephalon><Mice><Mice Mammals><Mid-brain><Midbrain><Midbrain structure><Modality><Modeling><Molecular><Murine><Mus><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neurodevelopmental Disorder><Neurological Development Disorder><Neurons><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Optic Tectum><Owls><Pathway interactions><Phase><Photic Stimulation><Play><Population><Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder><Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder><Primates><Primates Mammals><Process><Property><Public Health><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Role><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Sensory><Sensory Disorders><Sight><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Space Perception><Spatial Discrimination><Stimulus><Strigiformes><Structure><Superior Colliculus><Symptoms><Testing><Time><Tissue Growth><Vision><Visual><Visual Stimulation><adulthood><ages><auditory deprivation><auditory stimulus><autism spectral disorder><autism spectrum disorder><autistic individuals><autistic people><autistic spectrum disorder><awake><biological signal transduction><critical period><dementia praecox><density><developmental><developmental disease><developmental disorder><electrophysiological><experience><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><hearing deprivation><individuals on the autism spectrum><individuals on the spectrum><individuals with ASD><individuals with autism><individuals with autism spectrum disorder><insight><interest><mouse model><multi-modality><multimodality><multisensory><murine model><neurodevelopmental disease><neuronal><novel><ontogeny><pathway><people on the autism spectrum><people with ASD><people with autism><people with autism spectrum disorder><perceptual spatial orientation><receptive field><response><schizophrenic><sensory input><sensory integration><social role><somatosensory><sound deprivation><spatial integration><spatial orientation><spatial perception><success><superior colliculus Corpora quadrigemina><visual deprivation><visual function><visual information><visual map><visual receptive field><visual stimulus><visual tectum>,Autism; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD); Mental Health; Neurosciences
Common schizophrenia variants functioning in developmental human cortical interneurons,Common schizophrenia variants functioning in developmental human cortical interneurons,"Abstract
Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a highly heritable and complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Remarkable advances
have been made recently in SCZ genetic studies with an increasing number of risk loci reaching genome-wide
significance; however, gleaning biological insight from these loci has been challenging. The majority of SCZ risk
loci are located in non-coding regions. As such, it is hypothesized that they function by regulating distal gene
expression via 3D chromatin interactions. However, it has yet to be determined which loci are operational in
which cells, at what time points, and with what impact. Recent genomic analyses showed enriched SCZ
heritability in human fetal brains rather than adult brains, suggesting the role of SCZ risk loci in modulating fetal
development for increased SCZ risks. Thus, unraveling SCZ risk loci function during development will be critical
for understanding genetic influences on SCZ risks. Genetic influences on gene expression (e.g. expression
quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)) are cell-type-specific, and sometimes confer opposing effects depending on the
cell type, underscoring the importance of cell-type-specific studies using homogeneous cell populations for a
clear mechanistic understanding. Parvalbumin (PV)- or somatostatin (SST)-expressing medial ganglionic
eminence (MGE)-derived cortical interneurons (cINs) are consistently affected in SCZ brains. More importantly,
SCZ heritability is shown to be enriched in MGE cells in human fetal brains, necessitating the study of these
cells to understand the mechanisms of SCZ risk loci. Although there are no postmortem fetal SCZ tissues for
mechanistic study, in vitro differentiation of iPSC—which well recapitulates early embryonic development—
provides developmental SCZ brain cells with the same genetic makeup as patient brains. We established
methods for the efficient generation of homogeneous populations of MGE-derived cINs from healthy control
(HC) and SCZ iPSCs. We also extensively validated their functionality and authenticity both in vitro and in vivo,
including robust migration and synaptic integration into host brains that results in efficient inhibitory regulation of
host circuitry in transplanted mice. Using an unprecedentedly large number of iPSCs to provide homogeneous
populations of HC vs SCZ fetal cINs for mechanistic studies, we will address our hypothesis that SCZ risk loci
active in developmental MGE-type cINs regulate distal gene expression via 3D chromatin interactions.
Employing transcriptome analysis, PrediXcan analysis, and Micro-C analysis, we will map SCZ risk loci with
unknown functions to the risk genes they regulate in these vulnerable cell populations during development.
Developmental cIN-specific genetic influences on gene expression, identified based on multiple lines of
corroborating evidence, will be functionally validated using CRISPRi/CRISPRa approaches. This unbiased

Do opposing amygdala-striatal pathways enable chronic stress to promote habit formation?,Do opposing amygdala-striatal pathways enable chronic stress to promote habit formation?,"PROJECT SUMMARY
When making a decision we can use our understanding of available action-outcome relationships to prospectively
evaluate the consequences of our potential actions and choose the one that is currently most beneficial. This goal-
directed strategy is, thus, quite flexible, allowing us to readily adapt when circumstances change. For example,
when ordering dinner, you consider how nutritious and delicious each potential meal will be and will avoid options
that you’ve just had for lunch or do not meet your current nutritional needs. But we don’t always think about the
consequences of our behavior. Usually this is fine. Such habits are a way for our brain to efficiently execute routine
behaviors. But disrupted goal-directed learning and overreliance on habit can cause inadequate consideration of
consequences, inflexibility, a lower threshold for compulsivity, and disrupted decision making. This can contribute
to aspects of numerous diseases, including substance use disorder (SUD), obsessive-compulsive disorder,
obesity, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and autism. Chronic stress can attenuate goal-directed learning and
tip the balance of behavioral control towards habit. This is one major avenue through which chronic stress can
predispose one to SUD and other mental illnesses. But we know very little of how chronic stress promotes habit
formation. The overarching goal of this proposal is, thus, to expose the neuronal circuits through which chronic
stress promotes premature habit formation. This work will help us to understand how chronic stress can promote
maladaptive and pathological habits, which will be critical for understanding and treating SUD and mental illness.
Filling this gap is especially important because chronic stress contributes to mental health disparities in the US.
 Recent evidence from our team has suggested that central (CeA) and basolateral (BLA) amygdala projections
to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) may be critical conduits for stress-potentiated habit. Based on prior and our
preliminary data, our novel, comparative hypothesis is that BLADMS and CeADMS promote and oppose,
respectively, goal-directed learning and associated neuronal activity in the DMS and that chronic stress amplifies
CeADMS and attenuates BLADMS pathway activity to promote premature habit formation. We will test this
with a multifaceted approach including projection-specific optical neuronal activity monitoring and manipulation,
cell-type specific, cellular resolution, microendoscopic calcium imaging with pathway-specific chemogenetic
manipulations, a model of chronic stress, and theory-driven behavioral tools. We will expose how ensembles of
DMS neurons organize their activity during goal-directed and habit learning and how this is impacted by chronic
stress. We will reveal the functions of two understudied amygdala-striatal pathways in goal-directed and habit
learning and how they are influenced by chronic stress. More broadly, we will uncover neuronal circuitry through
which chronic stress promotes habit formation. This will provide a critical basic science foundation for our long-
term goal of understanding of how chronic stress is a conduit to pathological habits.",<A2AR><ADORA2><ADORA2A gene><ASD><Address><Adenosine A(2A) Receptor><Adenosine A2A Receptor><Affect><Amygdala><Amygdaloid Body><Amygdaloid Nucleus><Amygdaloid structure><Anxiety><Attenuated><Autism><Autistic Disorder><Basic Research><Basic Science><Behavior><Behavior Control><Behavior assessment><Behavioral><Behavioral Manipulation><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Calcium><Chronic><Chronic stress><Cognitive><Cognitive Manifestations><Cognitive Symptoms><Corpus Striatum><Corpus striatum structure><Coupled><Data><Decision Making><Disease><Disorder><Dissection><Early Infantile Autism><Encephalon><Equilibrium><Evaluation><Exposure to><Fiber><Foundations><Goals><Habits><Image><Infantile Autism><Instrumental Learning><Kanner's Syndrome><Knowledge><Learning><Mediating><Mental Depression><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Mental disorders><Mental health disorders><Modeling><Monitor><Motivation><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neurobehavioral Manifestations><Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms><Neurocyte><Neurons><Nutritional><Obesity><Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder><Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis><Operant Conditioning><Optics><Outcome><Pathologic><Pathway interactions><Photometry><Position><Positioning Attribute><Psychiatric Disease><Psychiatric Disorder><Psychological Health><RDC8><Regulation><Resolution><Rewards><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Stress><Striate Body><Striatum><Substance Use Disorder><System><Testing><Time><Work><adiposity><amygdaloid nuclear complex><attenuate><attenuates><autism spectral disorder><autism spectrum disorder><autistic spectrum disorder><balance><balance function><behavioral assessment><behavioral control><cell type><comparative><conditioning><corpulence><dementia praecox><depression><disparity in health><flexibility><flexible><gene manipulation><genetic manipulation><genetically manipulate><genetically perturb><habit learning><health disparity><imaging><innovate><innovation><innovative><instrumental conditioning><learning activity><learning method><learning outcome><learning strategies><learning strategy><mental illness><neurobehavioral symptom><neuronal><neuronal circuit><neuronal circuitry><novel><nutritious><optical><optogenetics><pathway><premature><prematurity><prevent><preventing><prospective><psychiatric illness><psychological disorder><recruit><resolutions><schizophrenic><striatal><substance use and disorder><success><theories><tool>,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Mental Health; Neurosciences; Substance Misuse
The role of Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 2 (BAI2) in synaptic structural organization and functional dynamics,The role of Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 2 (BAI2) in synaptic structural organization and functional dynamics,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Excitatory ionotropic synapses and their associated dendritic spines play critical roles in fundamental
information processing within the brain. The development and morphology of these synapses are highly
functionally relevant; previous studies have established that patients with many different neurodevelopmental,
neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric conditions are clinically defined by synaptopathies. Synaptopathies,
or disease at the level of the synapse, includes inappropriate loss of synapses and spines, enhanced or
lowered synapse and spine development, and aberrations to the synaptic structure that leads to dysfunctional
signaling. The Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor (BAI) subfamily of neuronal adhesion G-protein coupled
receptors (aGPCRs) are a three-member postsynaptic family of receptors predicted to form trans-synaptic
complexes to direct synaptogenesis and synapse structural development. BAI2 is the least studied of these
proteins, with no established role in neuronal or synaptic development. BAI2 also appears to be the most
functionally non-redundant member of the BAI family. Though whole exome data from human patients with
autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder suggests all BAI proteins are implicated in these
conditions, BAI2 does not bind the same presynaptic proteins as BAI1 and BAI3. Furthermore, a gain-of-
function mutation to BAI2 is the putative cause of a rare spastic paraparesis condition in humans, and loss-of-
function mutations are associated with hyperactive behavior in mice. Addressing the fundamental role and
molecular mechanism of BAI2 thus can help us understand both basic synapse development, and potentially
inform future studies into treatments of psychiatric and central nervous system-derived motor disorders. To this
end, my data on BAI2 suggests that the protein localizes to the PSD and promotes both pre- and postsynaptic
development. I propose to further define the role of BAI2 in synapse and spine development by delineating the
functional domains that regulate synapse development (Aim 1.1), quantifying nanostructural changes to
synaptic structures (Aim 1.2), and describing functional deficits (Aim 1.3) induced by loss of BAI2. In the future,
I plan to pursue a postdoctoral position investigating real-time changes to excitatory and inhibitory synaptic
nanodomains and signaling in baseline, plasticity, and disease conditions (Aim 2).",<21+ years old><ASD><Address><Adhesions><Adhesives><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><Ammon Horn><Angiogenesis Antagonists><Angiogenesis Blockers><Angiogenesis Inhibitors><Angiogenetic Antagonists><Angiogenetic Inhibitors><Angiogenic Antagonists><Angiogenic Inhibitors><Angiostatic Agents><Anti-Angiogenetic Agents><Anti-Angiogenic Agents><Anti-Angiogenic Drugs><Antiangiogenesis Agents><Antiangiogenic Agents><Antiangiogenic Drugs><Autism><Autistic Disorder><Axon Terminals><BAI1><BAI1 gene><BAI2><BAI2 gene><BAI3><BAI3 gene><Bipolar Affective Psychosis><Bipolar Disorder><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Brain-Specific Angiogenesis Inhibitor 2><Brain-Specific Angiogenesis Inhibitor 3><Brain-specific Angiogenesis Inhibitor 1><C-terminal><CNS Nervous System><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Junctions><Cell Signaling><Cells><Central Nervous System><Chemicals><Clinical><Co-culture><Cocultivation><Coculture><Coculture Techniques><Cognition Disorders><Coloring Agents><Complex><Cornu Ammonis><Data><Deletion Mutation><Dendritic Spines><Development><Disease><Disorder><Dissociation><Drugs><Dyes><Early Infantile Autism><Encephalon><Excitatory Synapse><F-Actin><Family><Filamentous Actin><Future><G Protein-Complex Receptor><G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes><G-Protein-Coupled Receptors><GPCR><Glutamate Receptor><Glutamates><Goals><Hippocampus><Human><Hyperactive behavior><Individual><Infantile Autism><Intercellular Junctions><Intrabody><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><KIAA0550><Kanner's Syndrome><Kinetics><Knowledge><L-Glutamate><Manic-Depressive Psychosis><Mediating><Medication><Mentors><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Molecular><Morphology><Motor Hyperactivity><Murine><Mus><Nanostructures><Neovascularization Inhibitors><Nerve Cells><Nerve Degeneration><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neuraxis><Neurocyte><Neurodevelopmental Disorder><Neurological Development Disorder><Neuron Degeneration><Neurons><Patients><Pharmaceutical Agent><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Pharmaceuticals><Pharmacologic Substance><Pharmacological Substance><Phase><Phenotype><Play><Point Mutation><Position><Positioning Attribute><Postdoc><Postdoctoral Fellow><Presynaptic Nerve Endings><Presynaptic Terminals><Protein Family><Proteins><Psychiatric therapeutic procedure><Publishing><Receptor Protein><Recycling><Research><Research Associate><Role><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Slice><Spastic Lower Extremity Weakness><Spastic Paraparesis><Spinal Column><Spine><Structure><Subgroup><Synapses><Synaptic><Synaptic Boutons><Synaptic Terminals><Synaptic Vesicles><Time><Transmission><Vertebral column><Work><adulthood><antiangiogenic><autism spectral disorder><autism spectrum disorder><autistic spectrum disorder><backbone><biological signal transduction><bipolar affective disorder><bipolar disease><bipolar illness><bipolar mood disorder><cognitive disease><cognitive disorder><cognitive syndrome><confocal imaging><dementia praecox><dendrite spine><density><developmental><drug/agent><exome><exomes><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><falls><fluorophore><gain of function mutation><glutamatergic><hippocampal><human data><information processing><interest><loss of function mutation><malformation><manic depressive disorder><manic depressive illness><member><molecular pathology><motor disease><motor disorder><motor dysfunction><multidisciplinary><nano><nano-sized structures><nano-structures><neural degeneration><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neurodevelopmental disease><neurological degeneration><neuronal><neuronal degeneration><neuropsychiatric><neuropsychiatric disease><neuropsychiatric disorder><neuropsychiatry><neurotransmitter release><pharmaceutical><post-doc><post-doctoral><post-doctoral trainee><postnatal><postsynaptic><presynaptic><psychiatric care><psychiatric therapy><psychiatric treatment><receptor><research associates><schizophrenic><social role><superresolution microscopy><synapse><synapse formation><synaptogenesis><transmission process><vesicle release><vesicular release>,Neurosciences
Regulating dopamine transport through allosteric modulation - Functional and Behavioral Studies,Regulating dopamine transport through allosteric modulation - Functional and Behavioral Studies,"The plasma-membrane monoamine transporters (MATs), including the serotonin (SERT), norepinephrine (NET)
and dopamine (DAT) transporters, serve a pivotal role in limiting monoamine-mediated neurotransmission
through the reuptake of their respective neurotransmitters. MATs are targets for the treatment of numerous
neurological disorders such as depression, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and they
serve as target proteins for major drugs of abuse such as amphetamine and cocaine. The continuing need for
therapeutic drugs to treat brain disorders involving aberrant monoamine signaling provides a compelling reason
to further our understanding of transporter function and to identify novel ways of targeting them.
This project builds on our recent discovery of an allosteric site (A2) within the MATs that can serve as a target
site for modulating their activity. Previous experiments in our group targeted the allosteric A2 site in SERT and
identified molecules that interact with this site and display remarkable transporter-modulating activities. These
compounds have revealed that engaging this site modulate MAT activity in entirely novel ways, including
affecting the interaction with transporter ligands such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and
psychostimulants. In corresponding experiments on DAT, we have identified compounds, KM822 and sydnocarb
among others, that similarly modifies DAT function. We find that these compounds interfere with the interaction
of DAT with exogenous ligands and attenuates psychostimulant-elicited behaviors in rodents. Computational
simulations further support the premise that compounds interacting with the allosteric A2 site can allow transport
while interfering with the interaction of the transporter with exogenous ligands like cocaine.
The overarching hypothesis of this project is that the specific engagement of the allosteric site in DAT will provide
valuable information regarding mechanisms of the dopamine transport process and could provide novel
therapeutic avenues for developing DAT-based medications. We propose to pursue this idea by further
characterizing the compounds to study allosteric modulation of DAT. We will in Aim 1 elucidate mechanisms of
allosteric transporter modulation through computational modelling and molecular simulations coupled with
functional and biochemical studies. In aim 2 we will evaluate the in vivo utility of the compounds by examining
their effects on psychostimulant-elicited behaviors in rodents. Finally, in Aim 3, we will employ structure-based
design to identify A2-specific compounds with improved properties. Consequently, the successful completion of
this project will result in the development of novel ligands of DAT that can be employed as experimental tools to
provide critical mechanistic information regarding allosteric transporter modulation. Furthermore, the design and
development of novel allosteric modulators of DAT will enable a systematic evaluation of the beneficial potential
of these compounds to ultimately provide new therapeutic opportunities.","<5-HT><5-Hydroxytryptamine><5HT><5HT transporter><5HTT protein><AD/HD><ADHD><Addictive Behavior><Address><Adopted><Affect><Alcohol abuse><Allosteric Site><Amphetamines><Animal Behavior><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Animals><Anxiety><Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder><Attenuated><Behavior><Behavioral><Bilateral><Binding><Binding Sites><Biochemical><Brain Diseases><Brain Disorders><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cell membrane><Clinical><Cocaine><Combining Site><Common Rat Strains><Computer Models><Computer Simulation><Computer based Simulation><Computerized Models><Coupled><Cytoplasmic Membrane><DA Neuron><DAT dopamine transporter><Data><Desoxynorephedrin><Development><Disease><Disorder><Dopamine><Dopamine neuron><Dose><Drug abuse><Drugs><Dysfunction><Elements><Encephalon Diseases><Enteramine><EtOH abuse><Evaluation><Event><Exclusion><Family><Functional disorder><Goals><Hippophaine><Hydroxytyramine><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Intracranial CNS Disorders><Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders><Knowledge><Learning><Levarterenol><Levonorepinephrine><Ligands><Locomotion><Mediating><Medication><Medicinal Chemistry><Mental Depression><Mental disorders><Mental health disorders><Methods><Modeling><Molecular><Molecular Interaction><Molecular Transport><Nerve Impulse Transmission><Nerve Transmission><Nerve Transmitter Substances><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neurologic><Neurologic Disorders><Neurological><Neurological Disorders><Neuronal Transmission><Neurotransmitters><Noradrenaline><Norepinephrine><Nucleus Accumbens><Pharmaceutic Chemistry><Pharmaceutical Chemistry><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Pharmacology><Phenamine><Phenopromin><Phenotype><Physiopathology><Plasma Membrane><Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder><Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder><Property><Proteins><Psychiatric Disease><Psychiatric Disorder><Rat><Rats Mammals><Rattus><Reactive Site><Regulation><Rewards><Rodent><Rodentia><Rodents Mammals><Role><SSRI><SSRIs><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor><Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor><Serotonin><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Site><Structure><Synapses><Synaptic><Therapeutic><Therapeutic Studies><Therapy Research><Transport Process><abuse liability><abuse of drugs><abuse potential><abused drug><abused drugs><abuses drugs><alcohol co-abuse><alcohol problem><analog><attenuate><attenuates><axon signaling><axon-glial signaling><axonal signaling><behavior study><behavioral study><biological signal transduction><cocaine prevention><computational modeling><computational models><computational simulation><computational studies><computer based models><computer studies><computerized modeling><computerized simulation><conditioning><dementia praecox><depression><design><designing><developmental><dl-Amphetamine><dopamine transporter><dopaminergic neuron><drug abused><drug candidate><drug of abuse><drug/agent><drugs abused><drugs of abuse><ethanol abuse><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><extracellular><glia signaling><glial signaling><hazardous alcohol use><improved><in vivo><mental illness><model of animal><monoamine><nerve signaling><neural signaling><neurological disease><neuronal NET protein><neuronal signaling><neurotransmission><new approaches><new drug treatments><new drugs><new pharmacological therapeutic><new therapeutics><new therapy><next generation therapeutics><noradrenaline transporter><norepinephrine transporter><norepinephrine transporter protein><novel><novel approaches><novel drug treatments><novel drugs><novel pharmaco-therapeutic><novel pharmacological therapeutic><novel strategies><novel strategy><novel therapeutics><novel therapy><pathophysiology><pharmacologic><pharmacophore><plasmalemma><pre-clinical><preclinical><problem alcohol use><problem drinking><problematic alcohol consumption><problematic alcohol use><psychiatric illness><psychological disorder><psychostimulant><psychostimulant use><psychostimulant use disorder><reuptake><schizophrenic><serotonin reuptake inhibitor><serotonin transporter><simulation><slc6a2 protein><slc6a5 protein><small molecule><social role><sodium-dependent noradrenaline transporter><sodium-dependent serotonin transporter><solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, noradrenalin), member 2><solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, norepinephrine), member 5><stimulant use><stimulant use disorder><synapse><therapeutic candidate><therapeutic evaluation><therapeutic testing><tool><use of stimulants>",Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Cocaine; Depression; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Stimulant Use and Misuse; Substance Misuse
Synapse-specific effects of synaptically released zinc: implications for auditory processing,Synapse-specific effects of synaptically released zinc: implications for auditory processing,"Project Summary
Many regions of the brain including the cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and limbic structures are
highly enriched with synaptic zinc. Synaptic zinc (as Zn2+) is loaded into presynaptic vesicles by zinc
transporter 3 (ZnT3), where it is coreleased with glutamate during synaptic transmission. Since synaptic
zinc inhibits AMPA and NMDA receptors – which mediate the majority of excitatory glutamatergic
transmission in the brain – synaptic zinc can modulate excitatory synaptic signaling. ZnT3 KO mice (which
lack synaptic zinc) display a range of cognitive and sensory impairments and demonstrate behavioral
deficits associated with autism and schizophrenia. Mounting evidence from human populations shows
that mutations in certain zinc transporters are linked with major neurological disorders such as
schizophrenia. Together, these findings strongly suggest that synaptic zinc signaling is important for
neuronal processing. The goals of this project are to understand how synaptic zinc contributes to normal
neuronal function and how disruptions in zinc signaling are linked to pathological neuronal conditions.
We will take three complimentary experimental approaches to these questions. 1) Using ex vivo brain
slice preparations and optogenetic stimulation paradigms, we dissect the roles of synaptic zinc in shaping
the dynamics of synaptic transmission at specific synaptic connections in cortical microcircuits. 2) Using
in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging, we assess the roles of synaptic zinc in shaping the sensory-evoked
responses of specific classes of auditory cortical neurons in awake mice. 3) Using in vitro high-throughput
screening assays and rational compound design approaches, we are designing novel tools to modulate
the function of specific zinc transport proteins. Together these approaches will allow us to answer
fundamental questions concerning the role of synaptic zinc in brain function and provide new mechanistic
insights into endogenous mechanisms that shape synaptic and neural processing.","<2-photon><AMPA Receptors><ASD><Ammon Horn><Assay><Auditory Cortex><Auditory area><Autism><Autistic Disorder><Basal Ganglia><Basal Nuclei><Behavioral><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Brain region><Calcium><Carrier Proteins><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Cornu Ammonis><Disturbance in cognition><Early Infantile Autism><Encephalon><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic defect><Glutamates><Goals><High Throughput Assay><Hippocampus><Human><Image><Impaired cognition><In Vitro><Infantile Autism><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><KO mice><Kanner's Syndrome><Knock-out Mice><Knockout Mice><L-Glutamate><Lead><Link><Mediating><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Murine><Mus><Mutation><N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors><N-Methylaspartate Receptors><NMDA Receptor-Ionophore Complex><NMDA Receptors><Nerve Cells><Nerve Transmitter Substances><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neural Cell><Neural Transmission><Neurocyte><Neurologic Disorders><Neurological Disorders><Neurons><Neurotransmitters><Null Mouse><Pathologic><Pb element><Population><Preparation><Role><SLC30A3><SLC30A3 gene><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Sensory><Sensory impairment><Shapes><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Slice><Solute Carrier Family 30 (Zinc Transporter), Member 3><Structure><Synapses><Synaptic><Synaptic Transmission><Synaptic Vesicles><Transmission><Transport Protein Gene><Transport Proteins><Transporter Protein><ZNT3><Zinc><Zinc Transporter 3><Zn element><auditory processing><autism spectral disorder><autism spectrum disorder><autistic spectrum disorder><awake><biological signal transduction><cartilage link protein><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive loss><dementia praecox><design><designing><genome mutation><glutamatergic><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><high throughput screening><hippocampal><imaging><in vivo><insight><link protein><neural><neural control><neural regulation><neurological disease><neuromodulation><neuromodulatory><neuronal><neuroregulation><novel><optogenetics><preparations><presynaptic><response><schizophrenic><social role><synapse><tool><transmission process><two-photon><zinc binding ligand><zinc transporter><zinc-binding protein>",Neurosciences
Designing belonging: Advancing science on environmental modifications to foster activity engagement and social connection among individuals with serious mental illness,Designing belonging: Advancing science on environmental modifications to foster activity engagement and social connection among individuals with serious mental illness,"ABSTRACT
 People with serious mental illness (SMI) experience dramatically worse health and longevity than the
general population, which is exacerbated by extremely high rates of loneliness and social isolation. Both social
isolation (lack of social supports) and loneliness (the subjective experience of isolation) are highly predictive of
early mortality. Although social isolation and loneliness are inherently relational, influenced by contextual
factors, and prevalent among people with SMI, very little is known about how to design community mental
health environments that foster social connection (“social architecture”). Thus, the goal of this K01 is to lay the
foundation for an innovative, impactful research career focused on reducing social isolation among people with
SMI through environmental design. My research plan employs a rigorous, mixed-method design to: 1) identify
environmental features associated with two behavioral mechanisms of action: activity engagement and social
interaction; 2) examine associations between activity engagement, social interaction, and self-reported
loneliness and support; and 3) feasibility test the co-design and implementation of an environmental
modification to support social connection. To do this, I will first conduct socio-spatial observations of activity
engagement and social interaction in four mental health Clubhouses in Hawaii. These are community-based
psychosocial rehabilitation centers that are highly interested in reducing loneliness among their members.
Observation data will be paired with survey data (N=150) to examine associations between observed activity
engagement and social interaction and self-reported loneliness and social support. Second, spatial
observations and social network data will be visualized to refine a conceptual model interlinking engagement
and social interaction. These visualizations will be shared with participating Clubhouses to contextualize the
identified patterns in engagement and social interaction and to co-identify potentially modifiable environmental
features associated with them. Third, an environmental intervention co-design process will be conducted in one
Clubhouse and the intervention will be implemented. Feasibility data on the co-design process and
modification of the environmental intervention protocol will be collected through field notes and a final focus
group and subsequently analyzed qualitatively. This research will be carried out with close mentorship from a
team of highly accomplished senior scholars: Drs. Henwood, Wenzel, Salzer, Valente, Wilson, and Stark. Their
work is directly aligned with my career and training goals, which focus on three intersecting areas of expertise:
1) socio-spatial methods (GIS, social network analysis and ecological momentary assessment), 2) theory
linking environmental design, human behaviors, and health, and 3) environmental intervention co-design based
on community-based participatory research principles. This K01 builds on my unique clinical and theoretical
background as an occupational therapist and community psychologist and lays the foundation for an
innovative, highly impactful career focused on reducing social isolation and loneliness among people with SMI.",<Address><American><Application Context><Architecture><Area><Attention><Beds><Behavior><Behavioral><Behavioral Mechanisms><Bipolar Affective Psychosis><Bipolar Disorder><CMHC><Career Development Awards><Career Development Awards and Programs><Career Development Programs K-Series><Clinical><Communities><Community Mental Health Centers><Data><Data Reporting><Development><Dose><Ecological momentary assessment><Empirical Research><Engineering / Architecture><Environment><Epidemic><Focus Groups><Fostering><Foundations><Frequencies><Future><General Population><General Public><Goals><Hawaii><Health><Human><Individual><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Interview><K-Awards><K-Series Research Career Programs><K12><K12 Award><K12 Mechanism><K12 Program><Knowledge><Length of Life><Link><Loneliness><Longevity><Major Depressive Disorder><Manic-Depressive Psychosis><Measures><Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Program><Mentorship><Methodology><Methods><Modeling><Modern Man><Modification><NIH><NIMH><National Institute of Mental Health><National Institutes of Health><Network Analysis><Occupational Therapist><Outcome><Participant><Pathway Analysis><Patient Self-Report><Pattern><Personal Satisfaction><Persons><Population><Prevalence><Process><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Psychological Health><Psychologist><Psychoses><Public Health><Recovery><Rehabilitation Centers><Reporting><Research><Research Career Program><Research Methodology><Research Methods><Research Support><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Scholarship><Science><Self-Report><Services><Severities><Site><Social Behavior><Social Interaction><Social Network><Social Sciences><Social isolation><Social support><Structure><Surgeon><Survey Instrument><Surveys><Testing><Time><Training><United States National Institutes of Health><Variant><Variation><Visualization><Work><behavior mechanism><bipolar affective disorder><bipolar disease><bipolar illness><bipolar mood disorder><built environment><career><chronic mental illness><clinical depression><community based participatory research><community led research><community participatory research><community partnered participatory research><contextual factors><cost><data representation><data representations><dementia praecox><design><designing><develop therapy><developmental><disparity in health><effectiveness study><environmental adaptation><environmental intervention><experience><feasibility testing><health disparity><improved><innovate><innovation><innovative><interest><intervention development><interventional strategy><lonely><major depression><major depression disorder><manic depressive disorder><manic depressive illness><member><methods to study multiple-level influences><mortality><multi-level analysis><multi-level model><multilevel analysis><multilevel model><multilevel modeling><novel><participatory action research><persistent mental illness><programs><protocol development><psychosocial rehabilitation><rehabilitative center><research and methods><schizophrenic><serious mental disorder><serious mental illness><severe mental disorder><severe mental illness><social><social support network><sociobehavior><sociobehavioral><theories><therapy development><timeline><treatment development><well-being><wellbeing>,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Prevention; Rehabilitation; Schizophrenia; Serious Mental Illness; Social Determinants of Health
Homeostatic Reset as a New Therapeutic Paradigm for Slow Progression Diseases,Homeostatic Reset as a New Therapeutic Paradigm for Slow Progression Diseases,"Project Summary
 This project responds to NIH Directors TRA RFA-RM-20-013 and will test the hypothesis that homeostatic
restoration of small GTPase signaling to modify Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
pathogenesis is a game-changing therapeutic approach compared to unidirectional targeting. If proven, this new
and innovative paradigm will have far-reaching and transformative impact for targeting other chronic diseases
and disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and drug addiction.
 The predominant and conventional therapeutic strategies in treating human diseases are unidirectionally
inhibiting or stimulating affected biological processes. However, in many chronic diseases such as AD and ALS,
complete inhibition or activation of the affected signaling events may themselves promote diseases. Disease
progression can also be spatiotemporal, with initial activation followed by inhibition or vice versa, as well as
activation versus inhibition at different brain regions. Thus, simple unidirectional targeting may itself be a major
reason that no drugs have successfully prevented, reversed or even modified the disease course for such
neurodegenerative disorders. To overcome this formidable challenge, new therapeutic paradigms must be
investigated. One approach is to restore homeostatic balance instead of completely inhibiting or activating the
affected signaling pathways. This approach is largely untested for AD and ALS but is broadly significant because
many other complex diseases also exhibit homeostatic imbalance and spatiotemporal dysregulation of signaling
pathways, making the use of inhibitors or activators ineffective if used inappropriately.
 This TRA project proposes to restore the homeostatic balance of Rho and Rab family small GTPase
signaling, which is spatiotemporally dysregulated in AD and ALS. The classical Rho GTPases include RhoA,
Rac1, and Cdc42, in which RhoA often acts in opposition to Rac1 and Cdc42 to control protein processing and
trafficking as well as synaptic remodeling. Rab GTPases additionally control ER stress and protein aggregation.
Our project will apply innovative dual function small molecules to investigate this antagonism for restoring
their homeostatic balance. We will determine the effects of their modulation on AD and ALS hallmark proteins
and pathogenesis in mouse models. If successful, this project will deliver novel first-in-class drug leads, and the
new therapeutic paradigm will transform the entire AD and ALS drug development landscape and beyond.
 In summary, our proposal provides a strong rationale for the transformative impact of establishing
homeostatic targeting at defective signaling processes in AD and ALS. With a multi-institution and multi-
disciplinary approach, this project will lead to novel and significant insights into whether targeting homeostatic
balances of defective signaling can modify AD and ALS disease course, providing a pioneering example of
applying the same approach for future targeting of other chronic and slow progression diseases.",<AD dementia><ASD><Abilify><Acceleration><Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors><Affect><Agonist><Alzheimer

Cholinergic Mechanisms of Associative Learning in Cortical Circuits,Cholinergic Mechanisms of Associative Learning in Cortical Circuits,"Project Summary
Numerous observations both in humans and in experimental animals support the notion that acetylcholine (ACh)
is important for learning and memory. However, the cellular and circuit mechanisms through which ACh’s
biochemical control over the excitability of cortical cells reorganizes cortical dynamics and mediate learning and
learning related plasticity, or other cognitive functions, remain poorly understood. This application takes
advantage of technological advances in the last decade that facilitate exploring how cortical neurons are
modulated under physiological circumstances of ACh release, as well as determine the contribution of these
modulations to the physiology of cortical neurons and networks during behavior. We have implemented a simple
associative learning task that has been shown to depend on changes in cortical circuitry in the whisker
representation area of the primary somatosensory cortex (wS1) and is well suited to investigating the cellular
and circuit mechanisms by which ACh promotes associative learning. We have obtained preliminary evidence
that acquisition of the association of the conditioned stimulus and a reward requires ACh release in wS1. The
goal of this exploratory R21 grant is to demonstrate feasibility of several experimental strategies to study the
cellular and circuit mechanisms by which ACh promotes learning in the task we have implemented and to begin
testing hypotheses about cholinergic mechanisms responsible for the behavior. For these goals, we propose two
Aims. In Aim 1, we investigate the requirement of ACh during different phases of the associative learning task.
In Aim 1A, we use 2-photon microscopy with a genetically-encoded fluorescent ACh sensor to investigate the
magnitude and time course of ACh release in wS1 during the acquisition and consolidation of the associative
learning and during performance of the task after the association has been learned. In Aim 1B we develop a
chemogenetics strategy for the transient suppression of cholinergic activity in wS1 during specific phases of the
associative learning. In Aim 2 we begin to develop a pharmaco-genetic strategy using cell-specific genetic
ablation of specific cholinergic receptors in different types of excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons to
begin to discover cholinergic actions that are important for associative learning in our task. These experiments
will help develop a framework for understanding how dysfunction in ACh signaling results in neurocognitive
disorders associated with the cholinergic system, and provide insights into potential cell-type specific
interventions.",<2-photon microscopy><ACh Receptors><AD dementia><Ablation><Acetylcholine><Acetylcholine Receptors><Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><Amnesia><Amnesia-Memory Loss><Animal Experiments><Anterograde Amnesia><Anterograde Memory Loss><Anti-Cholinergics><Anticholinergic Agents><Anticholinergics><Anticholinesterase Agents><Anticholinesterase Drugs><Anticholinesterases><Area><Arousal><Association Learning><Associative Learning><Attention><Behavior><Behavioral><Biochemical><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cerebral cortex><Cholinergic Receptors><Cholinesterase Inhibitors><Cholinoceptive Sites><Cholinoceptors><Cognitive><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Conditioned Stimulus><Connector Neuron><Cranial Nerve X><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Delirium><Dementia with Lewy Bodies><Disease><Disorder><Dissection><Disturbance in cognition><Drugs><Dysfunction><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Encephalon><Enzyme Gene><Enzymes><Forcible intercourse><Functional disorder><Genetic><Goals><Grant><Human><Hyoscine><Impaired cognition><In Vitro><Intercalary Neuron><Intercalated Neurons><Interneurons><Internuncial Cell><Internuncial Neuron><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Intoxication><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigation><Learning><Learning Disturbances><Link><Literature><Mediating><Medication><Memory><Memory Deficit><Memory impairment><Methods><Modern Man><Molecular><Monitor><Motor><Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor><Muscarinic Agents><Muscarinic Receptors><Muscarinics><Myoneural Junction><Nerve Cells><Nerve Degeneration><Nerve Transmitter Substances><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neural Cell><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurocyte><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Neurologic Disorders><Neurological Disorders><Neuromodulator><Neuromuscular Junction><Neuron Degeneration><Neurons><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Neurotransmitters><Pavlovian conditioning><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Pharmacogenetics><Phase><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiology><Physiopathology><Pneumogastric Nerve><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Process><Psychological reinforcement><Rape><Receptor Protein><Regulation><Reinforcement><Reporting><Research><Rewards><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Scopolamine><Sensory><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Somatosensory Cortex><Stimulus><Synapses><Synaptic><System><Task Performances><Technology><Tenth Cranial Nerve><Testing><Time><Vagus Nerve><Vagus nerve structure><Vibrissae><Whiskers><Work><acetylcholineesterase inhibition><acetylcholineesterase inhibitor><animal experiment><associative conditioning><biological signal transduction><cell cortex><cell type><cholinergic><cholinergic neuron><classical conditioning><cognitive control><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive function><cognitive loss><common treatment><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><delirious><dementia praecox><drug/agent><electrophysiological><excitatory neuron><experiment><experimental animal><experimental animals><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><forced sex><genetic approach><genetic strategy><inhibitor><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><interventional strategy><memory dysfunction><memory process><memory processing><microstimulation><neural control><neural degeneration><neural regulation><neurocognitive disorder><neurodegeneration><neurodegenerative><neurodegenerative illness><neurological degeneration><neurological disease><neuromodulation><neuromodulatory><neuronal><neuronal degeneration><neuroregulation><novel><operation><operations><pathophysiology><pharmacologic><primary degenerative dementia><receptor><response><schizophrenic><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><sensor><somesthetic sensory cortex><synapse><two photon excitation microscopy><two photon microscopy><virtual>,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Mental Health; Neurosciences
The role of novelty and surprise in aversive conditioning,The role of novelty and surprise in aversive conditioning,"Abstract
Novelty and surprise have long been known to facilitate learning and memory. At a functional level this makes sense;
unexpected events have to be learned about so they can be predicted and responded to appropriately in the future. At a
psychological level, surprising events have been shown to enhance memory because they induce rehearsal. Subjects tend
to “think about” unexpected events more than familiar ones after they occur. This has been observed directly in humans
(explicit rehearsal) and indirectly in animals (implicit rehearsal). In both cases, the memory enhancement can be
eliminated by disrupting rehearsal with a distractor stimulus that is presented immediately after the novel event.
Presenting the same distractor stimulus several minutes later has no effect. This suggests rehearsal is short-lasting and
distinct from the process of memory consolidation, which stabilizes new information for several hours after learning. In
addition to increasing rehearsal, novel events also trigger the release of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA), which
are known to enhance synaptic plasticity. Blocking receptors for these neuromodulators in the hippocampus prevents
animals from forming new spatial and contextual memories. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that surprising
events enhance memory because they induce catecholamine release at the same time the hippocampus is actively
rehearsing/replaying new information. Our preliminary data demonstrate that NE and DA are both released in the
hippocampus during and after the presentation of an unexpected aversive stimulus. At the same time, there is an increase
in sharp-wave ripple oscillations (SWRs), which are known to contain replay sequences for recently encountered stimuli.
Consequently, we will test the hypothesis above by monitoring and manipulating catecholamine release in real-time
during an aversive learning task while simultaneously recording oscillations and single unit activity in the hippocampus.",<AD dementia><AD/HD><ADHD><Active Follow-up><Address><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><American><Ammon Horn><Amnesia><Amnesia-Memory Loss><Animals><Anxiety><Anxiety Disorders><Association Learning><Associative Learning><Atrophic><Atrophy><Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder><Auditory><Aversive Stimulus><Bipolar Affective Psychosis><Bipolar Disorder><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Catecholamines><Circulatory Collapse><Common Rat Strains><Cornu Ammonis><Cues><Data><Disease><Disorder><Dopamine><Dopamine Antagonists><Dopamine Receptor><Dopamine Receptor Antagonists><Dopaminergic Antagonists><Dorsal><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Emotional disorder><Encephalon><Environment><Event><Extinction><Fear><Food><Fright><Future><Genetic><Goals><Hippocampus><Hour><Human><Hydroxytyramine><Impairment><Learning><Levarterenol><Levonorepinephrine><Life><Locus Coeruleus><Manic-Depressive Psychosis><Memory><Memory Deficit><Memory impairment><Mental disorders><Mental health disorders><Modern Man><Monitor><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neuromodulator Receptors><Neurons><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Noradrenaline><Norepinephrine><Nucleus Pigmentosus Pontis><Pavlovian conditioning><Play><Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder><Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Procedures><Process><Psychiatric Disease><Psychiatric Disorder><Rat><Rats Mammals><Rattus><Role><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Shock><Stimulus><Sympathins><Synaptic plasticity><System><Testing><Time><Training><United States><United States National Institutes of Health><active followup><associative conditioning><aversive conditioning><bipolar affective disorder><bipolar disease><bipolar illness><bipolar mood disorder><blue nucleus><circulatory shock><classical conditioning><co-morbid><co-morbidity><comorbidity><conditioned fear><dementia praecox><electrophysiological><emotional experience><experience><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><fear conditioning><follow up><follow-up><followed up><followup><hippocampal><in vivo><locus ceruleus structure><long term memory><longterm memory><manic depressive disorder><manic depressive illness><member><memory consolidation><memory dysfunction><memory process><memory processing><mental illness><neural><neural control><neural mechanism><neural regulation><neuromechanism><neuromodulation><neuromodulatory><neuronal><neuroregulation><novel><optogenetics><prevent><preventing><primary degenerative dementia><psychiatric illness><psychologic><psychological><psychological disorder><rehearsal><response><schizophrenic><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><sensor><shocks><social role><tool>,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences
The Role of Mental Imagery in Perceptual Abnormality Formation in Individuals at Clinical High-Risk for Psychosis,The Role of Mental Imagery in Perceptual Abnormality Formation in Individuals at Clinical High-Risk for Psychosis,"Project Summary/Abstract
Theories about the origin of perceptual abnormalities (attenuated hallucinations) have been evoked for
centuries. One competitive theory is that perceptual abnormalities can be explained by atypical predictive
coding. The predictive coding theory states that individuals use prior knowledge to create a mental model of
the environment and that mismatches of expectancy and experience lead to an updating of the prior mental
model. In people on the psychosis spectrum, more weight is given to the prior models and belief updating does
not occur. According to this theory, people who experience perceptual abnormalities misattribute the prior
expectation as a sensation leading to a perceptual experience. Adjacently, recent research in non-psychiatric
populations has investigated the mechanisms of mental imagery. When imagined signals are strong enough,
they can become subjectively indistinguishable from reality. Taking this novel research into account, it may be
possible that the vividness of mental imagery may affect the strength of prior beliefs and make it more or less
likely to experience perceptual abnormalities. Thus far, the role of mental imagery in the predictive coding
theory of perceptual abnormalities has not been explored. The proposed study will examine the role of mental
imagery in predictive coding using samples of people at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) who experience
perceptual abnormalities (N = 40), CHR individuals who do not experience perceptual abnormalities (N = 40),
and healthy controls (N = 40). Participants will partake in a clinical and cognitive assessment, including two
novel mental imagery tasks that instruct participants to imagine a sound or image and test their ability to
differentiate between imagined and real stimuli later in the task. Additionally, participants will complete a self-
report questionnaire about their mental imagery and perform a predictive coding task. Using this data, the
study will investigate three aims to understand whether the vividness of mental imagery relates to the presence
of perceptual abnormalities and if this improves the predictive coding model. Aim 1: validate the mental
imagery task and mechanisms in the CHR population. Aim 2: assess whether the vividness of mental imagery
relates to the severity of perceptual abnormalities. Aim 3: examine whether mental imagery can be
incorporated into the predictive coding model. Training Plan: to complete this project and build an independent
research career the applicant will (a) develop an understanding of theories and mechanisms of hallucination
formation, (b) gain comprehensive experience with building and interpreting computational models, and (c)
learn the principles and applications of structural equation modeling. This training will be accomplished through
regular meetings with a team of expert scholars, coursework, workshops, and attending conferences. Training
Environment: The training will take place at Northwestern University, which offers an excellent and
collaborative training environment. The environment, alongside the proposed study and training plan, will
position the applicant to launch a career researching the influence of cognition on positive symptoms.",<Affect><Appearance><Attenuated><Auditory><Automobile Driving><Belief><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Clinical assessments><Code><Coding System><Cognition><Computer Models><Computerized Models><Confusion><Confusional State><Data><Development><Disease><Disorder><Distress><Educational workshop><Environment><Equation><Esthesia><Expectancy><Functional impairment><Funding><Hallucinations><Image><Imagery><Imagination><Individual><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Knowledge><Lead><Learning><Logistic Regressions><Measures><Mental Confusion><Modeling><Modernization><Monitor><Noise><Participant><Patient Self-Report><Pb element><Perception><Persons><Population><Position><Positioning Attribute><Prevention><Probability><Psyche structure><Psychoses><Questionnaires><Reporting><Research><Risk><Role><Sampling><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Self-Report><Sensation><Sensory><Series><Severities><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Stimulus><Symptoms><Testing><Training><Translating><Universities><Update><Visual><Weight><Work><Workshop><analog><attenuate><attenuates><biological signal transduction><career><clinical high risk for psychosis><cognitive assessment><cognitive testing><computational modeling><computational models><computer based models><computerized modeling><conference><convention><dementia praecox><developmental><driving><expectation><experience><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><imaging><improved><interventional strategy><meeting><meetings><mental><mental imagery><novel><schizophrenic><social role><social stigma><sound><stigma><summit><symposia><symposium><theories><visual stimulus><weights>,Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Psychosis; Schizophrenia; Serious Mental Illness
The influence of the developing circadian system on neuroimmune function and neuropsychiatric behaviors,The influence of the developing circadian system on neuroimmune function and neuropsychiatric behaviors,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 1 in 3 American adolescents have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder; 3 in 20 with a mood
disorder, with 1 in 3 female adolescents experiencing at least one major depressive episode. The onset of
psychiatric disorders can occur in early life, potentially leading to a reduced quality of life due to a disruption in
emotional, psychological, and/or social development. Mental illness during youth may also result in long-term
consequences, including an increased risk of mental health challenges and diminished quality of life in adulthood.
Inflammation in the central nervous system (neuroinflammation) is thought to underlie anxiety and mood
disorders, yet there remain no broadly effective therapies. The neuroinflammatory pathology may be, in part,
caused by circadian dysregulation of the neuroimmune system. The circadian clock is critical for controlling
biological processes, generating time-of-day differences in gene expression, hormone release, and behaviors;
however, circadian rhythms dampen in psychiatric disorders. Although the percentage of individuals experiencing
psychiatric disorders concomitant with circadian disturbances remains unknown, circadian disruptions and sleep-
wake disturbances are used as diagnosable criteria for neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, circadian
dysregulation may be a potential biomarker and signal for early intervention in anxiety- and mood disorder-
related pathology. The immune system is tightly regulated by the circadian clock, and recent evidence
demonstrates circadian regulation of neuroimmune system components: microglia, meninges, and choroid
plexus. Microglia, the primary immune cell of the brain, are rhythmic cells that can trigger a release of
inflammatory molecules when activated, potentially triggering a suite of physiological and behavioral alterations.
The meninges and choroid plexus serve as immune surveillance sites and can also release inflammatory signals
that influence the activity of microglia. Together, these components may provide insights into the pathogenesis
and pathophysiology of mental disorders. However, the ontogeny of circadian rhythms in the neuroimmune
system has not been well-documented. Early developmental periods offer a potential window for intervention
and prevention of neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, we hypothesize that circadian rhythms in the neuroimmune
system emerge early in life, and perturbations during development will alter neuroimmune function that leads to
behavioral changes. This proposal addresses the following specific aims: First, establish the development of
circadian rhythms in “clock” and inflammatory genes in critical neuroimmune tissues; second, reveal whether
early life environmental and genetic perturbations to the circadian system lead to long-term behavioral changes.
This contribution will be significant because our results will identify temporal windows of high and low
neuroimmune reactivity during development. We expect these results will uniquely combine expertise in
circadian biology, immunology, and behavioral neuroscience to identify a novel role for biological rhythms in
regulating neuroinflammatory pathology and mood-related behaviors via the neuroimmune system.",<21+ years old><ARNTL><ARNTL gene><ASD><Address><Adolescent><Adolescent Youth><Adult><Adult

4/5-Clinical Outcome Prediction of Psychosis from EHRs (COPPER),4/5-Clinical Outcome Prediction of Psychosis from EHRs (COPPER),"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clinical predictors are now firmly incorporated into routine standard-of-care in many fields of medicine, in contrast
with Psychiatry where quantitative predictors that guide clinical decision-making remain extremely
limited. Psychosis-related disorders are responsible for a substantial public health burden, for which there are
significant unmet needs that would be subserved by clinical predictors. For example, long-term outcomes vary
widely and identifying individuals with poor or advantageous future outcomes would help to optimize treatment
planning and resource allocation. Furthermore, antipsychotics are associated with adverse side effects, such as
increased risk of diabetes. In this application, we propose to use machine learning approaches to build predictors
and identify subtypes of clinical outcomes among individuals with schizophrenia, through integration of
longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), dimensional phenotyping, and genetic analyses. We will also
explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. Our long-term objective is to
advance the goals of Precision Psychiatry to achieve individualized treatment planning, outcome monitoring, and
preventive interventions. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Leverage two independent EHR
databases for outcome prediction and sub-classification of psychosis-related disorders. (a) We will use
the longitudinal PSYCKES and MarketScan databases to build machine learning-based individual-level
prediction models to forecast the onset of four major prognostic outcomes: treatment response (antipsychotic
resistance), illness severity (long-term hospitalization), medical comorbidity (diabetes), and diagnostic transition
from a psychosis-related disorder to schizophrenia. (b) We will perform cohort-level analyses using unsupervised
methods to discover novel psychosis-related diagnosis and prognosis subtypes. Aim 2: Enhance predictive
modeling through dimensional phenotyping and whole genome sequencing. (a) We will recruit n = 10,000
patients with schizophrenia from the PSYCKES database population for enriched data collection: 1) dimensional
phenotyping (cognition, exposome, and social determinants of health), and 2) whole genome sequencing to
enable calling of rare variants, structural variants, and common variants (polygenic risk). (b) We will investigate
the extent to which dimensional phenotypes and genomic data can improve the models developed in Aim 1. Aim
3: Explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. (a) We will survey
a subset of patients and their clinicians regarding their attitudes towards implementation of clinical outcome

3/5- Biomarkers to Enhance Early Schizophrenia Treatment (BEEST),3/5- Biomarkers to Enhance Early Schizophrenia Treatment (BEEST),"PROJECT SUMMARY
The onset of a first episode of psychosis (FEP) in late adolescence or early adulthood often leads to lifelong
disability. Timing and precision of treatment are of the essence during this critical developmental period.
Unfortunately, FEP patients who do not respond to a conventional first-line antipsychotic (FL-AP) are often
delayed in transitioning to clozapine (CLZ) - or never switch at all - despite the clear superiority of CLZ to FL-
APs in treatment resistant individuals. However, CLZ treatment involves risks of severe side effects, including
agranulocytosis and weight gain. Currently, clinicians and patients currently have no objective, clinically validated
tools to guide this complex decision making in FEP. Our collaborative group has recently published work showing
that a functional brain scan can help predict which FEP patients might not respond to FL-APs, such as
aripiprazole and risperidone. Further, we have shown that a simple genetics test can help predict who is less
likely to gain significant weight, and, similarly, who is less likely to develop agranulocytosis.
We propose to conduct a multi-center, harmonized, randomized clinical trial with the goal of testing whether the
use of biomarkers can lead to better outcomes for FEP patients. The goal of the proposed study is to develop a
clozapine decision support tool based on these biomarkers. First, we will characterize 410 people with an FEP
using three specific biomarkers: a resting state fMRI scan from which we will derive the striatial connectivity
index (SCI) and two genetics tests (one for weight gain and the other for agranulocytosis). Those patients who
are predicted to not respond to FL-APs, and who also have low risk of weight gain and agranulocytosis
(approximate n=180), will be randomized in a triple-blind controlled study to either clozapine or an FL-AP (either
aripiprazole or risperidone) for 12 weeks of treatment. Our main outcomes relate to clinical response, including
positive symptoms, suicidal thinking, and days of hospitalization. We will also perform an MRI at study end to
determine whether functional patterns in the brain distinguish CLZ responders from non-responders (target
engagement). Critically, we are partnering with people with lived experience of psychosis and family members
to help guide us during this trial, and to inform the study design and outcomes; information and choice are
amongst the strongest elements of a successful therapeutic relationship. Overall, our study will evaluate the
efficacy of whether using three biomarkers at the beginning of a first psychotic episode can lead to better patient
outcomes for patients at risk for poor response, by rapidly introducing CLZ rather than waiting for multiple failures
of FL-APs. Our key deliverable would be a clozapine decision support tool, consisting of the three biomarkers
combined with our CLZ dosing strategy for FEP. Such a tool would be a necessary step in the development of
precision psychiatry; if this efficacy trial is successful, a future study would then utilize implementation science
to optimize strategies for dissemination of the decision support tool.","<12-20 years old><Abilify><Acceleration><Adherence><Adolescence><Age><Agranulocytosis><Antipsychotic Agents><Antipsychotic Drugs><Antipsychotics><Biological Markers><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Brain scan><Caring><Clinical><Clozapine><Complex><Controlled Study><Corpus Striatum><Corpus striatum structure><Country><Data><Decision Making><Dedications><Development><Dose><Drugs><Education><Educational aspects><Elements><Employment><Encephalon><Failure><Family><Family member><Feeling suicidal><Functional MRI><Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Future><General Population><General Public><Genotype><Goals><Granulocytopenia><HLA-DQB1><HLA-DQB1 antigen><HLA-DQbeta1><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Hospitals><Image><Individual><Lifelong disability><Lived experience><Lived experiences><MC4 Receptor><MR Imaging><MR Tomography><MRI><MRIs><Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Major Tranquilizers><Major Tranquilizing Agents><Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance><Medication><Melanocortin 4 Receptor><NIMH><NMR Imaging><NMR Tomography><National Institute of Mental Health><Neuroleptic Agents><Neuroleptic Drugs><Neuroleptics><Neutropenia><Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Outcome><Patient outcome><Patient-Centered Outcomes><Patient-Focused Outcomes><Patients><Pattern><Permanent disability><Persons><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Pharmacogenetics><Phase><Population><Precision therapeutics><Psychiatry><Psychoses><Psychotic Disorders><Publishing><Randomized><Randomized, Controlled Trials><Receptor Gene><Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4><Research Design><Resistance><Rest><Risk><Risk-associated variant><Risperidone><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Services><Striate Body><Striatum><Study Type><Subgroup><Suicidal thoughts><Symptoms><System><Testing><Therapeutic><Weight><Weight Gain><Weight Increase><Work><Youth><Youth 10-21><Zeugmatography><acute care><adolescence (12-20)><adult youth><aged><ages><aripiprazole><bio-markers><biologic marker><biomarker><blind><body weight gain><body weight increase><cohort><cost><critical developmental period><critical period><dementia praecox><determine efficacy><developmental><disability><dissemination strategy><drug/agent><early adulthood><early psychosis><efficacy analysis><efficacy assessment><efficacy determination><efficacy evaluation><efficacy examination><efficacy trial><emerging adult><evaluate efficacy><examine efficacy><expectation><experience><fMRI><fMRI scan><first episode psychosis><functional MRI scan><functional magnetic resonance imaging scan><functional outcomes><gene locus><gene testing><gene-based testing><genetic locus><genetic testing><genomic location><genomic locus><high risk><imaging><implementation science><improved><improved outcome><indexing><inpatient care><inpatient service><mortality><patient oriented outcomes><precision therapies><precision treatment><predict responsiveness><predicting response><predictive biomarkers><predictive marker><predictive molecular biomarker><preservation><primary outcome><psychotic><psychotic illness><randomisation><randomization><randomized control trial><randomized, clinical trials><randomly assigned><reduce suicidality><reduce suicide><reducing suicidality><reducing suicide><resistant><resperidone><responders and non-responders><responders from non-responders><responders or non-responders><responders versus non-responders><responders vs non-responders><responders/nonresponders><response><response to therapy><response to treatment><risk allele><risk gene><risk genotype><risk loci><risk locus><risk variant><schizophrenic><secondary outcome><side effect><specific biomarkers><striatal><study design><suicidal ideation><suicidal morbidity><suicidal risk><suicidal thinking><suicide death><suicide ideation><suicide morbidity><suicide risk><support tools><therapeutic response><therapy response><thoughts about suicide><tool><treatment response><treatment responsiveness><trial comparing><weights><wt gain><young adult><young adulthood>",Biomedical Imaging; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Disability Research; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Precision Medicine; Prevention; Psychosis; Schizophrenia; Serious Mental Illness; Suicide
04S1: Targeting Processing Speed Deficits to Improve Social Functioning and Lower Psychosis Risk in Adolescents at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis,04S1: Targeting Processing Speed Deficits to Improve Social Functioning and Lower Psychosis Risk in Adolescents at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis,"Project Summary
Prevention of schizophrenia has primarily focused on adolescents and young adults who are considered to be
at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. These youngsters display subtle clinical symptoms that are similar to
psychosis but not as intense, and therefore considered to still be amenable to early intervention. Initial
prevention efforts used anti-psychotics as the primary preventive agents but these were shown to be largely
ineffective. More recent approaches have focused on the remediation of the cognitive deficits that are readily
apparent and predictive of future illness in CHR adolescents. However, while cognitive remediation has shown
substantial promise for improving cognitive deficits and improving outcomes in patients with schizophrenia, it
has not yet been markedly successful with CHR youth. The proposed study will test an innovative internet-
based remotely-delivered Specific COgnitive REmediation plus Surround (or SCORES) intervention for CHR
adolescents ages 14-20 years old that targets early processing speed deficits as measured at the
neuropsychological level with the processing speed domain from the NIMH-Measurement and Treatment
Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) consensus cognitive battery. The proposed
SCORES treatment package is grounded in a theoretical framework, supported by findings from our group and
others, where processing speed deficits contribute to poor social functioning, which in turn leads to an
increased risk for psychosis. We specifically selected cognitive remediation because it directly targets a core
cognitive mechanism, processing speed, which is a rate limiting factor to higher order behaviors and clinical
outcome in CHR adolescents. To overcome past difficulties in applying a cognitive remediation treatment to
CHR teenagers, we have developed a platform to support our targeted processing speed training, which
involves reducing the heterogeneity of the CHR study population (including a reduced age range, narrowed
clinical criteria, and targeting individuals with pre-existing processing deficits). In addition, we have adding a
novel support surround component which is expected to increase enjoyment and promote retention. In the
single-arm R61 phase, a 2-year proof of concept study, 30 CHR individuals will receive SCORES for 10
weeks(4hrs per wk/40 hrs total) with a midpoint assessment at 20 hours (5 weeks) to demonstrate target
engagement and identify the optimal dose of SCORES needed to engage the target. In the R33 phase, a 3
year pilot study, we will replicate target engagement in a new and larger sample of 54 CHR individuals
randomized to SCORES (optimized dose)or to a Video GameControl condition to firmly establish the centrality
of processing speed. In addition, the R33 phase will determine if changes in target engagement are associated
with improved social functioning and decreasing attenuated positive symptoms.",<0-11 years old><20 year old><20 years of age><Adolescent><Adolescent Youth><Adolescent and Young Adult><Age><Antipsychotic Agents><Antipsychotic Drugs><Antipsychotics><Attenuated><Behavior><Child><Child Youth><Children (0-21)><Clinical><Cognitive><Cognitive deficits><Cognitive remediation><Consensus><Dose><Early Intervention><Exercise><Future><Hour><Individual><Internet><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><MATRICS><MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery><Major Tranquilizers><Major Tranquilizing Agents><Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia><Measures><Motivation><NIMH><National Institute of Mental Health><Neuroleptic Agents><Neuroleptic Drugs><Neuroleptics><Neuropsychologies><Neuropsychology><Outcome><Patients><Phase><Pilot Projects><Prevention><Preventive><Psychoses><Psychotic Disorders><Randomized><Sampling><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Self-Help Groups><Social Functioning><Support Groups><Symptoms><Teen><Teenagers><Testing><Time><Training><WWW><Youth><Youth 10-21><age 20 years><ages><arm><attenuate><attenuates><clinical heterogeneity><clinical high risk for psychosis><cognitive defects><cognitive training><delivered remotely><dementia praecox><design><designing><function socially><functioning social><high risk><high risk group><high risk individual><high risk people><high risk population><high-risk adolescents><improved><improved outcome><innovate><innovation><innovative><interventional strategy><juvenile><juvenile human><kids><neuropsychologic><novel><pilot study><processing speed><psychosis risk><psychotic illness><randomisation><randomization><randomly assigned><remote delivery><schizophrenia risk><schizophrenic><self help organization><study population><teen years><teenage><twenty year old><twenty years of age><web><world wide web><youngster>,Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Pediatric; Prevention; Psychosis; Rehabilitation; Schizophrenia; Serious Mental Illness
YOUNG ADULTS WITH VIOLENT BEHAVIOR DURING EARLY PSYCHOSIS: A MIXED-METHODS ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION TRIAL,YOUNG ADULTS WITH VIOLENT BEHAVIOR DURING EARLY PSYCHOSIS: A MIXED-METHODS ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION TRIAL,"Project Summary: Although the absolute risk of violence among persons with serious mental illnesses (SMI)
is small, young people experiencing early psychosis are a subgroup at highest violence risk. Violence is a
public health issue that contributes to health disparities experienced by adults with schizophrenia, including
caregiver burden, social isolation, and incarceration and subsequent early mortality. Cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT) for psychosis and similar behavioral interventions have had efficacy in reducing impairment and
improving functioning among young adults with early psychosis. However, no identified studies have explored
using a behavioral intervention to reduce violence among young adults with early psychosis.
 In this application, Dr. Stephanie Rolin proposes a comprehensive path towards becoming an independent
physician investigator creating and adapting evidence-based approaches to assess and reduce violence risk.
Specifically, this proposal follows the CDC’s Map of Adaptation, a model for adapting evidence-based
interventions (EBI), to adapt and evaluate the feasibility of an early intervention services (EIS)-specific CBT-
based intervention to reduce violence with proposed targets consistent with the transdiagnostic nature of
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). This research will occur at OnTrackNY, the largest EIS program in the
United States; OnTrackNY has provided evidence-based coordinated specialty care to over 1,800 individuals
at more than 20 clinics in New York State. First, Dr. Rolin will conduct individual semi-structured interviews with
EIS clients who have engaged in recent violent behavior (n=20) and clinicians who have worked with EIS
clients who have engaged in violent behavior (n=10). These interviews will use the Theory of Planned Behavior
to identify key areas of an existing CBT model called PICASSO (which has shown efficacy in reducing
violence) that require adaptation for the EIS setting. Next, Dr. Rolin will adapt the PICASSO model for the EIS
setting in an open pilot trial, through an iterative process that utilizes mixed methods assessment. Finally, Dr.
Rolin will evaluate the intervention’s feasibility through a pilot RCT.
 To further her long-term career goal of becoming an independent physician-investigator focused on creating
and adapting EBI to reduce violence risk, Dr Rolin will pursue training in the following four areas: (1) qualitative
research including mixed methods; (2) psychosocial intervention adaptation; (3) psychotherapy clinical trials;
and (4) grant writing. The product of this study will be an R01 of a large RCT to test the feasibility of the first
EBI of CBT to reduce violence in the EIS setting. Overall, this award will ensure Dr. Rolin’s successful
transition to an independent physician investigator studying the assessment and prevention of violence among
adults with SMI.","<21+ years old><Adult><Adult Human><Age><Aggression><Aggressive behavior><Area><Award><Behavior><Behavior Conditioning Therapy><Behavior Modification><Behavior Therapy><Behavior Treatment><Behavioral Conditioning Therapy><Behavioral Modification><Behavioral Therapy><Behavioral Treatment><Burden on their caregivers><Caregiver Burden><Chronic><Client><Clinic><Clinical Trials><Clinical Trials Design><Cognition Therapy><Cognitive Psychotherapy><Cognitive Therapy><Cognitive treatment><Conditioning Therapy><Conduct Disorder><Coordinated Specialty Care><Data><Development><Diagnosis><Diagnostic><Early Intervention><Ensure><Evidence based intervention><Forensic Medicine><Forensics><Goals><Grant><Guidelines><Health Services><History><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Impairment><Imprisonment><Impulsivity><Individual><Inpatients><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Intervention Trial><Interventional trial><Interview><Investigators><Life><Manuals><Maps><Matched Group><Mentorship><Methods><Modeling><NIMH><National Institute of Mental Health><Nature><New York><Onset of illness><Out-patients><Outcome><Outpatients><Participant><Patients><Pattern><Persons><Physicians><Planning Theory><Population><Process><Psychiatrist><Psychoses><Psychotherapy><Public Health><QOL><Qualifying><Qualitative Methods><Qualitative Research><Quality of life><RDoC><Randomized, Controlled Trials><Recording of previous events><Research><Research Domain Criteria><Research Personnel><Research Support><Researchers><Risk><Sampling><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Schools><Service setting><Social isolation><Strategic Planning><Structure><Subgroup><Symptoms><Testing><Therapeutic Intervention><Training><Treatment Efficacy><United States><Violence><Work><Writing><acceptability and feasibility><adult youth><adulthood><ages><antisocial behavior><behavior intervention><behavioral intervention><burden in caregivers><burden of their caregivers><burden on caregivers><career><chronic mental illness><cognitive behavior intervention><cognitive behavior modification><cognitive behavior therapy><cognitive behavioral intervention><cognitive behavioral modification><cognitive behavioral therapy><cognitive behavioral treatment><community setting><convict><critical period><dementia praecox><developmental><disease onset><disorder of conduct><disorder onset><disorders of conduct><disparity in health><early experience><early psychosis><efficacy testing><evidence base><experience><feasibility testing><functional improvement><health disparity><high risk><histories><improve function><improved><improved functional outcomes><incarcerated><incarceration><intervention efficacy><intervention therapy><interventional strategy><mortality><non-affective psychoses><nonaffective psychoses><peer><persistent mental illness><pilot trial><prevent><prevent violence><preventing><psychosocial><qualitative reasoning><randomized control trial><response><schizophrenic><serious mental disorder><serious mental illness><service delivery><service intervention><service programs><severe mental disorder><severe mental illness><therapeutic efficacy><therapy efficacy><violence prevention><violent><violent behavior><violent crime><young adult><young adulthood>",Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Health Services; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Pediatric; Prevention; Psychosis; Schizophrenia; Serious Mental Illness; Social Determinants of Health; Violence Research; Youth Violence; Youth Violence Prevention

Dopaminergic Control of Glial Cells in Prefrontal Cortex Functions,Dopaminergic Control of Glial Cells in Prefrontal Cortex Functions,"Project Summary
Recent research in the study of brain functions is highlighting the important role of glial cells in
several human neurological and psychiatric disorders. The dopaminergic control of brain
functions is classically assigned to the effect of dopamine on neurons. However, D2R
expression has also been reported in astrocytes, questioning what their contribution in the
dopamine-dependent control of brain functions is.
Based on preliminary evidence showing an increase of astrocytes and microglia in the PFC of
mice with an altered control over dopamine synthesis and release, we hypothesize that D2R
signaling in astrocytes influences the activity of neighboring cells and induces microglia
proliferation. This mechanism could play a role in the control of PFC dependent behavior, gene
expression in astrocytes and microglia, as well as on the metabolites that they produce.
Thus, we propose to perform experiments to determine the impact of D2R signaling in astrocyte
on PFC functions. We will use viral vectors to knockdown D2R specifically in astrocytes in mice

1/5 Biomarkers to Enhance Early Schizophrenia Treatment (BEEST),1/5 Biomarkers to Enhance Early Schizophrenia Treatment (BEEST),"PROJECT SUMMARY
The onset of a first episode of psychosis (FEP) in late adolescence or early adulthood often leads to lifelong
disability. Timing and precision of treatment are of the essence during this critical developmental period.
Unfortunately, FEP patients who do not respond to a conventional first-line antipsychotic (FL-AP) are often
delayed in transitioning to clozapine (CLZ) - or never switch at all - despite the clear superiority of CLZ to FL-
APs in treatment resistant individuals. However, CLZ treatment involves risks of severe side effects, including
agranulocytosis and weight gain. Currently, clinicians and patients currently have no objective, clinically validated
tools to guide this complex decision making in FEP. Our collaborative group has recently published work showing
that a functional brain scan can help predict which FEP patients might not respond to FL-APs, such as
aripiprazole and risperidone. Further, we have shown that a simple genetics test can help predict who is less
likely to gain significant weight, and, similarly, who is less likely to develop agranulocytosis.
We propose to conduct a multi-center, harmonized, randomized clinical trial with the goal of testing whether the
use of biomarkers can lead to better outcomes for FEP patients. The goal of the proposed study is to develop a
clozapine decision support tool based on these biomarkers. First, we will characterize 410 people with an FEP
using three specific biomarkers: a resting state fMRI scan from which we will derive the striatial connectivity
index (SCI) and two genetics tests (one for weight gain and the other for agranulocytosis). Those patients who
are predicted to not respond to FL-APs, and who also have low risk of weight gain and agranulocytosis
(approximate n=180), will be randomized in a triple-blind controlled study to either clozapine or an FL-AP (either
aripiprazole or risperidone) for 12 weeks of treatment. Our main outcomes relate to clinical response, including
positive symptoms, suicidal thinking, and days of hospitalization. We will also perform an MRI at study end to
determine whether functional patterns in the brain distinguish CLZ responders from non-responders (target
engagement). Critically, we are partnering with people with lived experience of psychosis and family members
to help guide us during this trial, and to inform the study design and outcomes; information and choice are
amongst the strongest elements of a successful therapeutic relationship. Overall, our study will evaluate the
efficacy of whether using three biomarkers at the beginning of a first psychotic episode can lead to better patient
outcomes for patients at risk for poor response, by rapidly introducing CLZ rather than waiting for multiple failures
of FL-APs. Our key deliverable would be a clozapine decision support tool, consisting of the three biomarkers
combined with our CLZ dosing strategy for FEP. Such a tool would be a necessary step in the development of
precision psychiatry; if this efficacy trial is successful, a future study would then utilize implementation science
to optimize strategies for dissemination of the decision support tool.","<12-20 years old><Abilify><Acceleration><Adherence><Adolescence><Age><Agranulocytosis><Antipsychotic Agents><Antipsychotic Drugs><Antipsychotics><Biological Markers><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Brain scan><Caring><Clinical><Clozapine><Complex><Controlled Study><Corpus Striatum><Corpus striatum structure><Country><Data><Decision Making><Dedications><Development><Dose><Drugs><Education><Educational aspects><Elements><Employment><Encephalon><Failure><Family><Family member><Feeling suicidal><Functional MRI><Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Future><General Population><General Public><Genotype><Goals><Granulocytopenia><HLA-DQB1><HLA-DQB1 antigen><HLA-DQbeta1><Hospital Admission><Hospitalization><Hospitals><Image><Individual><Lifelong disability><Lived experience><Lived experiences><MC4 Receptor><MR Imaging><MR Tomography><MRI><MRIs><Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Major Tranquilizers><Major Tranquilizing Agents><Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance><Medication><Melanocortin 4 Receptor><NIMH><NMR Imaging><NMR Tomography><National Institute of Mental Health><Neuroleptic Agents><Neuroleptic Drugs><Neuroleptics><Neutropenia><Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Outcome><Patient outcome><Patient-Centered Outcomes><Patient-Focused Outcomes><Patients><Pattern><Permanent disability><Persons><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Pharmacogenetics><Phase><Population><Precision therapeutics><Psychiatry><Psychoses><Psychotic Disorders><Publishing><Randomized><Randomized, Controlled Trials><Receptor Gene><Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4><Research Design><Resistance><Rest><Risk><Risk-associated variant><Risperidone><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Services><Striate Body><Striatum><Study Type><Subgroup><Suicidal thoughts><Symptoms><System><Testing><Therapeutic><Weight><Weight Gain><Weight Increase><Work><Youth><Youth 10-21><Zeugmatography><acute care><adolescence (12-20)><adult youth><aged><ages><aripiprazole><bio-markers><biologic marker><biomarker><blind><body weight gain><body weight increase><cohort><cost><critical developmental period><critical period><dementia praecox><determine efficacy><developmental><disability><dissemination strategy><drug/agent><early adulthood><early psychosis><efficacy analysis><efficacy assessment><efficacy determination><efficacy evaluation><efficacy examination><efficacy trial><emerging adult><evaluate efficacy><examine efficacy><expectation><experience><fMRI><fMRI scan><first episode psychosis><functional MRI scan><functional magnetic resonance imaging scan><functional outcomes><gene locus><gene testing><gene-based testing><genetic locus><genetic testing><genomic location><genomic locus><high risk><imaging><implementation science><improved><improved outcome><indexing><inpatient care><inpatient service><mortality><patient oriented outcomes><precision therapies><precision treatment><predict responsiveness><predicting response><predictive biomarkers><predictive marker><predictive molecular biomarker><preservation><primary outcome><psychotic><psychotic illness><randomisation><randomization><randomized control trial><randomized, clinical trials><randomly assigned><reduce suicidality><reduce suicide><reducing suicidality><reducing suicide><resistant><resperidone><responders and non-responders><responders from non-responders><responders or non-responders><responders versus non-responders><responders vs non-responders><responders/nonresponders><response><response to therapy><response to treatment><risk allele><risk gene><risk genotype><risk loci><risk locus><risk variant><schizophrenic><secondary outcome><side effect><specific biomarkers><striatal><study design><suicidal ideation><suicidal morbidity><suicidal risk><suicidal thinking><suicide death><suicide ideation><suicide morbidity><suicide risk><support tools><therapeutic response><therapy response><thoughts about suicide><tool><treatment response><treatment responsiveness><trial comparing><weights><wt gain><young adult><young adulthood>",Biomedical Imaging; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Disability Research; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Precision Medicine; Prevention; Psychosis; Schizophrenia; Serious Mental Illness; Suicide
Long-term neural consequences of altered critical period timing.,Long-term neural consequences of altered critical period timing.,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neural circuits are comprised of a rich network of neurons and associated glia that communicate through
chemical signals. These signals are essential for proper development of neural circuits, and removal of these
signals often impairs synapse development, circuit wiring, and circuit function. During development, animal
experience drives activity-dependent remodeling of neural circuit structure and function during brief windows
called critical periods. Critical periods are thought to set the ground state for neural circuit wiring, ensuring proper
circuit connectivity and synaptic stability, though this hypothesis remains to be tested.
 Recent work indicates that astrocyte-derived signals regulate critical period closure across diverse
circuits and animal models. In Drosophila, the motor circuit exhibits a critical period of activity-dependent
structural remodeling at the embryo/larval transition. Astrocytes first associate with motor dendrites during peak
motor plasticity, and ablating astrocytes is sufficient to extend the critical period. Genetic screening revealed that
astrocyte-driven critical period closure is dependent on the expression of several cell surface molecules,
including Neuroligin 2 (Nlg2) and Dally/GPC5. Astrocyte-specific knockdown of these signaling molecules
extended critical period plasticity, whereas astrocyte-specific overexpression drove precocious critical period
closure. To understand the mechanisms that establish and maintain neural circuits to drive animal behavior, it is
important to examine the long-term consequences of altered critical period timing on circuit structure and
function. I hypothesize that altering the timing of critical periods will induce long-term changes in motor
circuit structure and function to produce distinct motor behaviors. I will use the complementary binary
expression systems, Gal4/UAS or LexA/LexAop, to manipulate the expression of astrocyte-derived nlg2 and
dally to extend (Aim 1) or precociously close (Aim 2) the motor critical period while I simultaneously assess motor
circuit structure and function. Specifically, I will evaluate long-term changes to circuit connectivity, synaptic
stability, motor output, and locomotor behavior by assessing these features at successively later stages spanning
circuit development to the mature circuit. The completion of these experiments will provide insights into how
altered critical period timing affects circuit development at the synaptic and cellular levels, and will directly link
these changes to motor behavior. Thus, my goals meet priority area #4 of the BRAIN Initiative, “Demonstrating
causality: Link brain activity to behavior with precise interventional tools that change neural circuit dynamics.”
 The role of astrocytes in closing critical periods has only recently been uncovered. This discovery opens
a new intervention point for investigating the development and long-term maintenance of neural circuits. As this
role of astrocytes is conserved from fly through mouse, I anticipate that the results of this project will be broadly
applicable across distinct systems and circuits.",<ASD><Ablation><Abscission><Affect><Animal Behavior><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Animals><Area><Assay><Astrocytes><Astrocytus><Astroglia><Autism><Autistic Disorder><Axon><BRAIN initiative><Behavior><Behavior assessment><Behavioral><Bioassay><Biologic Models><Biological Assay><Biological Models><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative><CNS plasticity><Causality><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cell Surface Proteins><Cell surface><Cells><Chemicals><Communication><Contracting Opportunities><Contracts><Data><Dendrites><Development><Disease><Disorder><Drosophila><Drosophila genus><EPSP><Early Infantile Autism><Embryo><Embryonic><Encephalon><Ensure><Equilibrium><Etiology><Excision><Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials><Exhibits><Extirpation><Flies><Frequencies><Genes><Genetic Models><Genetic Screening><Glia><Glial Cells><Goals><Hour><Human><Impairment><Individual><Infantile Autism><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Kanner's Syndrome><Kolliker's reticulum><Link><Locomotion><Long-Term Effects><Longterm Effects><Maintenance><Mice><Mice Mammals><Model System><Modeling><Modern Man><Motion><Motor><Motor Cell><Motor Neurons><Motor output><Murine><Mus><Muscle><Muscle Cells><Muscle Tissue><Myocytes><Nerve Cells><Nerve Impulse Transmission><Nerve Transmission><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neural Development><Neurocyte><Neuroglia><Neuroglial Cells><Neurologic Dysfunctions><Neuronal Plasticity><Neuronal Transmission><Neurons><Non-neuronal cell><Nonneuronal cell><Output><Phenotype><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiology><Population><Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing><Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing><Publishing><RNA Interference><RNA Silencing><RNAi><Removal><Role><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Signaling Molecule><Speed><Structure><Surgical Removal><Synapses><Synaptic><System><Temperature><Testing><Time><Work><astrocytic glia><autism onset><autism spectral disorder><autism spectrum disorder><autistic spectrum disorder><axon signaling><axon-glial signaling><axonal signaling><balance><balance function><behavioral assessment><biological signal transduction><causation><cell type><central nervous system plasticity><critical developmental period><critical period><dementia praecox><developmental><developmental plasticity><disease causation><experience><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><fly><fruit fly><gene manipulation><genetic manipulation><genetically manipulate><genetically perturb><glia signaling><glial signaling><hatching><in vivo><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><interventional strategy><knock-down><knockdown><model of animal><model organism><motoneuron><motor behavior><motor impairment><movement impairment><movement limitation><muscular><nerve cement><nerve signaling><neural><neural circuit><neural circuitry><neural plasticity><neural signaling><neurocircuitry><neurodevelopment><neuroligin 2><neurological dysfunction><neuronal><neuronal signaling><neuroplastic><neuroplasticity><neurotransmission><novel><optogenetics><overexpress><overexpression><resection><schizophrenic><social role><synapse><synapse function><synaptic circuit><synaptic circuitry><synaptic function><tool>,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Neurosciences

2/5 Clinical Outcome Prediction of Psychosis from Electronic Health Records (COPPER),2/5 Clinical Outcome Prediction of Psychosis from Electronic Health Records (COPPER),"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clinical predictors are now firmly incorporated into routine standard-of-care in many fields of medicine, in contrast
with Psychiatry where quantitative predictors that guide clinical decision-making remain extremely
limited. Psychosis-related disorders are responsible for a substantial public health burden, for which there are
significant unmet needs that would be subserved by clinical predictors. For example, long-term outcomes vary
widely and identifying individuals with poor or advantageous future outcomes would help to optimize treatment
planning and resource allocation. Furthermore, antipsychotics are associated with adverse side effects, such as
increased risk of diabetes. In this application, we propose to use machine learning approaches to build predictors
and identify subtypes of clinical outcomes among individuals with schizophrenia, through integration of
longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), dimensional phenotyping, and genetic analyses. We will also
explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. Our long-term objective is to
advance the goals of Precision Psychiatry to achieve individualized treatment planning, outcome monitoring, and
preventive interventions. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Leverage two independent EHR
databases for outcome prediction and sub-classification of psychosis-related disorders. (a) We will use
the longitudinal PSYCKES and MarketScan databases to build machine learning-based individual-level
prediction models to forecast the onset of four major prognostic outcomes: treatment response (antipsychotic
resistance), illness severity (long-term hospitalization), medical comorbidity (diabetes), and diagnostic transition
from a psychosis-related disorder to schizophrenia. (b) We will perform cohort-level analyses using unsupervised
methods to discover novel psychosis-related diagnosis and prognosis subtypes. Aim 2: Enhance predictive
modeling through dimensional phenotyping and whole genome sequencing. (a) We will recruit n = 10,000
patients with schizophrenia from the PSYCKES database population for enriched data collection: 1) dimensional
phenotyping (cognition, exposome, and social determinants of health), and 2) whole genome sequencing to
enable calling of rare variants, structural variants, and common variants (polygenic risk). (b) We will investigate
the extent to which dimensional phenotypes and genomic data can improve the models developed in Aim 1. Aim
3: Explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. (a) We will survey
a subset of patients and their clinicians regarding their attitudes towards implementation of clinical outcome

Time-dependent changes in chloride homeostasis are a mechanism of plasticity critical for learning,Time-dependent changes in chloride homeostasis are a mechanism of plasticity critical for learning,"ABSTRACT
 The mechanisms underlying how rewards are learned, and how they translate into behavior have been
a subject of interest to researchers and scientists since Pavlov’s classical conditioning experiments in the
1890s. Recently, Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA) neurons in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) have
emerged as key modulators of reward learning, and potential therapeutic targets for addressing addiction,
depression, and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Previous studies have shown that GABA neurons in the VTA
undergo a form of experience-dependent plasticity that involves the downregulation of the anion transporter,
KCC2. This reduction of KCC2 levels has been found to increase the excitability of GABA neurons by
decreasing the efficacy of GABAA receptor function. In the context of drugs of abuse and aversive stimuli, this
mechanism has been studied in great detail. However, the impact of this mechanism on specific reward-related
pathways and its contribution to naturalistic reward learning remains unknown.
 In my thesis work thus far, I have examined whether modifications in KCC2 serve as an innate
mechanism during reward learning that allows the brain to establish enduring associations between
contextual cues and appetitive stimuli. I first characterized the expression of KCC2 throughout the course of
cue-reward associative learning and showed that KCC2 downregulation shifts VTA GABA neurons towards
excitability at critical time points during reward learning. My data also demonstrate that KCC2-mediated
plasticity drives increased synchronized activity between VTA GABA neurons ex vivo. Subsequently, I
demonstrate that VTA GABA neurons exhibit enhanced synchronization in vivo, and it is concurrent with the
same time points when KCC2 downregulation occurs.
 This F99/K00 proposal comprises two aims outlined in the following research plan. In Aim 1, I will
examine whether this form of plasticity occurs in vivo, and consequently leads to enhanced synchronized
network activity. To achieve this, I will combine multi-unit silicon recordings with pharmacological and genetic
approaches to manipulate levels of KCC2 and examine neural network dynamics during reward learning. Aim 2
delineates my aspirations to identify and obtain a postdoctoral position. During the K00 phase, I plan to
investigate the molecular, cellular, and neurocircuit-specific mechanisms shaping susceptibility or
resilience to common neuropsychiatric disorders. To this end, my sponsors and I have crafted a thorough
plan for my F99 (predoctoral) and K00 (postdoctoral) phases. The F99/K00 will support my goals for becoming
an independent researcher by facilitating the successful completion of my PhD and bolstering a seamless
transition into a strong postdoctoral position.",<Acceleration><Address><Anions><Appearance><Appetite><Association Learning><Associative Learning><Autoregulation><Aversive Stimulus><Behavior><Behavior Control><Behavioral><Behavioral Manipulation><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Butanoic Acids><Butyric Acids><Cannulas><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Chloride Ion><Chlorides><Cl- element><Committee Members><Common Rat Strains><Coupled><Cues><DA Neuron><Data><Desire for food><Doctor of Philosophy><Dopamine neuron><Down-Regulation><Drugs><Educational process of instructing><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Encephalon><Ensure><Environment><Event><Exhibits><Exposure to><Fellowship><Funding><Genetic><Goals><Homeostasis><Impairment><Implant><Infusion><Infusion procedures><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigators><K-Cl cotransporter><KCl cotransporter><Lead><Learning><Link><Mediating><Mediator><Medication><Mental Depression><Mentors><Mentorship><Modification><Molecular><Nature><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neurons><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Nucleus Accumbens><Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder><Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis><Organism><Outcome><Output><Pathway interactions><Pavlovian conditioning><Pb element><Ph.D.><PhD><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Pharmacology><Phase><Physiological Homeostasis><Physiology><Position><Positioning Attribute><Postdoc><Postdoctoral Fellow><Predisposition><Process><R-Series Research Projects><R01 Mechanism><R01 Program><Rat><Rats Mammals><Rattus><Receptor Protein><Regulation><Research><Research Associate><Research Grants><Research Personnel><Research Project Grants><Research Projects><Research Resources><Researchers><Resources><Rewards><Role><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Scientist><Shapes><Si element><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Silicon><Slice><Source><Stimulus><Stress><Susceptibility><Synaptic plasticity><Teaching><Time><Training><Translating><Transmission><Universities><Ventral Tegmental Area><Work><abused drug><abused drugs><addiction><addictive disorder><antagonism><antagonist><aspirate><associative conditioning><behavioral control><biological signal transduction><career><career development><chloride-cotransporter potassium><classical conditioning><conference><convention><dementia praecox><depression><dopaminergic neuron><drug abused><drug of abuse><drug/agent><drugs abused><drugs of abuse><electrophysiological><environment enrichment><environment enrichment for laboratory animals><environmental enrichment><environmental enrichment for laboratory animals><experience><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><genetic approach><genetic strategy><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><in vivo><infusions><interest><interventional strategy><living system><neural><neural network><neuronal><neuropsychiatric disease><neuropsychiatric disorder><novel><optogenetics><pathway><pharmacologic><post-doc><post-doctoral><post-doctoral trainee><post-doctoral training><postdoctoral training><pre-doc><pre-doctoral><predoctoral><prevent><preventing><programs><receptor><receptor function><research associates><resilience><resilient><response><schizophrenic><social role><summit><symposia><symposium><therapeutic target><timeline><transmission process><ventral tegmentum>,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Mental Health; Neurosciences
5/5 Clinical Outcome Prediction of Psychosis from Electronic Health Records (COPPER),5/5 Clinical Outcome Prediction of Psychosis from Electronic Health Records (COPPER),"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clinical predictors are now firmly incorporated into routine standard-of-care in many fields of medicine, in contrast
with Psychiatry where quantitative predictors that guide clinical decision-making remain extremely
limited. Psychosis-related disorders are responsible for a substantial public health burden, for which there are
significant unmet needs that would be subserved by clinical predictors. For example, long-term outcomes vary
widely and identifying individuals with poor or advantageous future outcomes would help to optimize treatment
planning and resource allocation. Furthermore, antipsychotics are associated with adverse side effects, such as
increased risk of diabetes. In this application, we propose to use machine learning approaches to build predictors
and identify subtypes of clinical outcomes among individuals with schizophrenia, through integration of
longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), dimensional phenotyping, and genetic analyses. We will also
explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. Our long-term objective is to
advance the goals of Precision Psychiatry to achieve individualized treatment planning, outcome monitoring, and
preventive interventions. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Leverage two independent EHR
databases for outcome prediction and sub-classification of psychosis-related disorders. (a) We will use
the longitudinal PSYCKES and MarketScan databases to build machine learning-based individual-level
prediction models to forecast the onset of four major prognostic outcomes: treatment response (antipsychotic
resistance), illness severity (long-term hospitalization), medical comorbidity (diabetes), and diagnostic transition
from a psychosis-related disorder to schizophrenia. (b) We will perform cohort-level analyses using unsupervised
methods to discover novel psychosis-related diagnosis and prognosis subtypes. Aim 2: Enhance predictive
modeling through dimensional phenotyping and whole genome sequencing. (a) We will recruit n = 10,000
patients with schizophrenia from the PSYCKES database population for enriched data collection: 1) dimensional
phenotyping (cognition, exposome, and social determinants of health), and 2) whole genome sequencing to
enable calling of rare variants, structural variants, and common variants (polygenic risk). (b) We will investigate
the extent to which dimensional phenotypes and genomic data can improve the models developed in Aim 1. Aim
3: Explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. (a) We will survey
a subset of patients and their clinicians regarding their attitudes towards implementation of clinical outcome
predictors. (b) We will return pathogenic findings to patients through genetic counseling and survey the
experience of patients and their clinicians on their emotional reactions and perceptions of impairment, treatability,
and life-planning.",<AI system><Address><Antipsychotic Agents><Antipsychotic Drugs><Antipsychotics><Artificial Intelligence><Attitude><CLIA accredited><CLIA approved><CLIA certified><CLIA compliant><CLIA licensed><Classification><Clinical><Code><Coding System><Cognition><Computer Analysis><Computer Reasoning><Consensus><Consent><Copy Number Polymorphism><DNA><Data><Data Analytics><Data Base Management><Data Base Management Systems><Data Bases><Data Collection><Database Management Systems><Databases><Deoxyribonucleic Acid><Diabetes Mellitus><Diagnosis><Diagnostic><Dimensions><Disease><Disorder><Electronic Health Record><Ethics><Functional RNA><Future><Genetic><Genetic Counseling><Genetic analyses><Goals><Impairment><Individual><Institutionalization><Insurance><Interview><Knowledge><Life><Machine Intelligence><Machine Learning><Major Tranquilizers><Major Tranquilizing Agents><Medicaid><Medical><Medicine><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Methods><Modeling><Monitor><Nature><Neuroleptic Agents><Neuroleptic Drugs><Neuroleptics><New York><Non-Coding><Non-Coding RNA><Non-translated RNA><Noncoding RNA><Nontranslated RNA><Outcome><Pathogenicity><Patient Recruitments><Patients><Perception><Personalized medical approach><Persons><Pharmacological Treatment><Phenotype><Population><Population Database><Preventative intervention><Prognosis><Psychiatry><Psychological Health><Psychoses><Public Health><Recovery><Refractory><Research><Resistance><Resource Allocation><Risk><Sampling><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Services><Severity of illness><Site><Specialty><Study models><Survey Instrument><Surveys><System><Systematics><Untranslated RNA><Validation><Variant><Variation><biobank><biorepository><cardiometabolic><cardiometabolism><chronic mental illness><clinical decision-making><clinical implementation><clinical practice><clinical predictive model><clinical predictors><clinical subtypes><co-morbid><co-morbidity><cohort><comorbidity><computational analyses><computational analysis><computer analyses><computer based prediction><copy number variant><copy number variation><customized therapy><customized treatment><data base><database management><database systems><dementia praecox><diabetes><diabetes risk><disease severity><electronic health care record><electronic health medical record><electronic health plan record><electronic health registry><electronic medical health record><emotional reaction><entire genome><ethical><experience><full genome><genetic analysis><genetic information><genome sequencing><genomic data><genomic data-set><genomic dataset><improved><individual patient><individualized approach><individualized medicine><individualized patient treatment><individualized therapeutic strategy><individualized therapy><individualized treatment><intervention for prevention><long term hospitalization><longterm hospitalization><machine based learning><medical specialties><meeting><meetings><model building><mortality><multidisciplinary><noncoding><novel><outcome prediction><participant recruitment><patient specific therapies><patient specific treatment><patient subclass><patient subcluster><patient subgroups><patient subpopulations><patient subsets><patient subtypes><persistent mental illness><personalized approach><phenotypic data><precision approach><precision medicine><precision-based medicine><predict clinical outcome><predictive modeling><prevention intervention><preventional intervention strategy><preventive intervention><prognostic><prospective><psychosocial><rare allele><rare mutation><rare variant><recruit><relational database management systems><resistant><response to therapy><response to treatment><schizophrenic><serious mental disorder><serious mental illness><severe mental disorder><severe mental illness><side effect><social health determinants><standard of care><tailored approach><tailored medical treatment><tailored therapy><tailored treatment><therapeutic response><therapy optimization><therapy response><tool><treatment optimization><treatment planning><treatment response><treatment responsiveness><unique treatment><validations><whole genome>,Behavioral and Social Science; Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Genetics; Human Genome; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Patient Safety; Precision Medicine; Psychosis; Schizophrenia; Serious Mental Illness; Social Determinants of Health
"Cogito:  A turnkey solution for rapidly developing, evaluating, deploying, and scaling digital therapeutics","Cogito:  A turnkey solution for rapidly developing, evaluating, deploying, and scaling digital therapeutics","Digital therapeutics are transforming healthcare. Digital therapeutics are clinical-grade software used
to prevent, treat, or manage a medical disorder or disease. A large body of research demonstrates that digital
therapeutics can have a major impact on health costs, health behavior, and health outcomes. For example, in
our work, digital therapeutics for substance use disorders (SUDs) more than double drug abstinence rates
compared to standard addiction treatment systems in the U.S. and greatly increase retention in SUD treatment.
They also have synergistic effects with medication treatments for SUDs. And, they are associated with marked
reductions in ED visits, inpatient utilization, and net costs, and increases in medication adherence.
Despite their impressive clinical value, several challenges persist in fully realizing the potential of digital
therapeutics to improve people’s lives across the globe. First, the pace at which digital therapeutics are
developed, tested and commercialized is slow. Second, many development activities are redundant across
projects. Third, due to budget, time and capacity constraints, many scientists develop prototypes of digital
therapeutics that can be used in research trials but which are not built to scale for use by large numbers of end
users. Finally, most digital therapeutics cannot be readily adapted for use by various target populations critical
for advancing digital health equity (e.g., adapted to culture, language, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation).
 Based on over two decades of NIH-supported work developing, evaluating and commercializing digital
therapeutics, we have developed a unique digital therapeutics platform (Laddr) which integrates science-
based, therapeutic processes to address a wide range of behavioral problems within a single digital platform.
This platform offers the potential to revolutionize digital health - as it provides a scalable model for delivering
digital therapeutics to treat any disorder with a behavioral component. We now plan to make an editable
version of Laddr (which we call Cogito) commercially available to developers of digital therapeutics. Cogito will
provide a turnkey solution for rapidly developing, evaluating, deploying, and scaling digital therapeutics for the
prevention, treatment and/or management of any disease or disorder - via a drag and drop interface with no
programming necessary.
 In this Phase 1 SBIR application, we will finalize several features of the Cogito platform to increase its
commercial potential as a turnkey platform for developing and hosting digital therapeutics. And we will assess
the feasibility, technical merit, and commercial potential of the Cogito digital therapeutics platform via usability
testing with clinical researchers. We will focus on the usability of Cogito with researchers in the field of SUD
treatment in this initial phase and then expand to a broad clinical research community focused on the
prevention, treatment, or management of various health conditions in future iterations of this work. Overall,
Cogito offers great promise to markedly accelerate the pace and impact of science based digital therapeutics.",<AD/HD><ADHD><Acceleration><Accident and Emergency department><Achievement><Achievement Attainment><Address><Adherence><Alcohol Drinking><Alcohol consumption><Anxiety><Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder><Behavior><Behavior Conditioning Therapy><Behavior Modification><Behavior Therapy><Behavior Treatment><Behavioral><Behavioral Conditioning Therapy><Behavioral Modification><Behavioral Therapy><Behavioral Treatment><Binge eating disorder><Budgets><Cardiology><Caring><Clinical><Clinical Evaluation><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Clinical Testing><Communities><Computer software><Conditioning Therapy><Development><Diabetes Mellitus><Diagnostic><Diet><Disease><Disease remission><Disorder><Drops><Drugs><ED visit><ER visit><Eating Disorders><Emergency Department><Emergency care visit><Emergency department visit><Emergency hospital visit><Emergency room><Emergency room visit><EtOH drinking><EtOH use><Ethnic Origin><Ethnicity><Evaluation><Exercise><Funding><Future><Health><Health Care Costs><Health Costs><Health behavior><Health behavior and outcomes><Healthcare><Healthcare Costs><Individual><Inpatients><Investigators><Language><Learning><Medical><Medication><Mental Depression><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Modeling><NIDA><NIH><National Institute of Drug Abuse><National Institute on Drug Abuse><National Institutes of Health><Nature><Oncology><Oncology Cancer><Pain Control><Pain Therapy><Pain management><Panic Disorder><Participant><Persons><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phase><Population><Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder><Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder><Prevention><Problem behavior><Process><Psychological Health><Race><Races><Regimen><Remission><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><SBIR><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Science><Scientist><Sex Orientation><Sexual Orientation><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Smoking><Software><Substance Use Disorder><System><THC co-use><THC use><Target Populations><Testing><Tetrahydrocannabinol co-use><Tetrahydrocannabinol use><Therapeutic><Time><Transcend><United States National Institutes of Health><Work><addiction><addictive disorder><alcohol ingestion><alcohol intake><alcohol product use><alcohol use><alcoholic beverage consumption><alcoholic drink intake><behavior change><behavior intervention><behavioral health><behavioral intervention><behavioral problem><cannabis use><chronic pain><chronic pain patient><clinical test><commercialization><cost><dementia praecox><depression><developmental><diabetes><diabetes management><diabetes mellitus management><diabetic management><diets><digital delivery><digital health><digital platform><digital therapeutics><digital therapy><digital treatment><digitally deliver><drug abstinence><drug adherence><drug compliance><drug/agent><ethanol consumption><ethanol drinking><ethanol ingestion><ethanol intake><ethanol product use><ethanol use><evidence base><experience><functional improvement><health care><health equity><health related behavior><improve function><improved><improved functional outcomes><interest><marijuana use><medication adherence><medication compliance><multiple substance use><multisubstance use><nicotine consumption><nicotine use><opiate consumption><opiate drug use><opiate intake><opiate use><opioid consumption><opioid drug use><opioid intake><opioid use><overdose death><overdose fatalities><pain treatment><panic anxiety syndrome><patient centered><patient oriented><patient with chronic pain><poly substance use><polysubstance use><prevent><preventing><prototype><psychostimulant use><racial><racial background><racial origin><research clinical testing><respiratory><schizophrenic><skills><stimulant use><substance use><substance use and disorder><substance use treatment><substance using><therapeutic agent development><therapeutic development><tool><usability><use of stimulants>,Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Mental Health; Prevention; Substance Misuse; Telehealth

Identifying ancestry-specific and distal components of disease-associated gene regulation and cellular function,Identifying ancestry-specific and distal components of disease-associated gene regulation and cellular function,"Summary/Abstract
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have associated hundreds of thousands of genetic variants with
human disease and complex traits. 90% of associated variants reside in noncoding sequences that can
enhance or suppress gene expression levels. While GWAS does not reveal the target genes of associated
variants, extraordinary effort has been dedicated to mapping target genes that carry out the functional effects
of noncoding genetic variation. While knowing which genetic variants cause disease is not often sufficient for
clinical intervention, identifying disease genes can efficiently accelerate the development of therapeutics.
Correlations between genotype and gene expression, known as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)
studies, can provide valuable insight into the mechanism of disease-associated variants. For example, a
previous study found MAPK3 to be associated with schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental phenotypes via a
key role in neuronal proliferation. Thousands of genetic associations are still uncharacterized in terms of their
target genes and cell types of action. This proposal will develop new algorithms to robustly map disease-
associated variants to disease-critical genes and infer their cell-type-specific regulatory behavior across three
aims. First, we hypothesize that new disease-critical genes will be discovered if variants are accurately
mapped to target genes in non-Europeans, where cohorts are small and variant-to-gene mapping is imprecise.
To this end, we will develop a novel gene-disease mapping technique for understudied populations. Second,
we hypothesize that linking distal regulatory variants to target genes should provide mechanistic explanations
for many uncharacterized GWAS variants. To this end, we will develop a high-dimensional feature selection
technique to detect distal effects on gene expression. Third, we hypothesize that novel variant-to-gene links
can be identified by analyzing rare cell types from single cell RNA-sequencing. To this end, we will link variants
to genes in cell-type-specific contexts using mixed models for heritability estimation. Overall, while gene
expression prediction models are a powerful tool to link genes to disease, they have been applied to only
limited study designs: single ancestry gene expression cohorts (which are not powerful in non-European
populations with limited sample sizes), predictor variants in the cis regulatory window, and bulk tissue or cell
type gene expression data. There are many open questions due to these limitations that our proposal aims to
address including the degree to which genetic variation regulates gene expression in population-specific
manners, via long-range mechanisms, in cell-type-specific or cell-state-specific manners, and in ways that are
relevant to complex traits and diseases. Our contribution is expected to be significant because still 30% of
disease-associated variants have no known target gene and because this work will diversify genetic discovery
to populations who are most at risk.",<3-D><3-Dimensional><3D><Acceleration><Accounting><Address><Algorithms><Autoimmune Diseases><Automobile Driving><Basal Transcription Factor><Basal transcription factor genes><Behavior><Benchmarking><Best Practice Analysis><Binding><Body Tissues><Cell Body><Cell Function><Cell Physiology><Cell Process><Cells><Cellular Function><Cellular Physiology><Cellular Process><Chromosome Mapping><Clinical><Complex><DNA><Data><Dedications><Deoxyribonucleic Acid><Disease><Disorder><Distal><Drug Targeting><ERK 1><ERK1><ERK1 Kinase><Epigenetic><Epigenetic Change><Epigenetic Mechanism><Epigenetic Process><Equity><European><Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase 1><Functional RNA><GWA study><GWAS><Gene Action Regulation><Gene Expression><Gene Expression Monitoring><Gene Expression Pattern Analysis><Gene Expression Profiling><Gene Expression Regulation><Gene Localization><Gene Mapping><Gene Mapping Genetics><Gene Regulation><Gene Regulation Process><Gene variant><General Transcription Factor Gene><General Transcription Factors><Genes><Genetic><Genetic Diversity><Genetic Models><Genetic Variation><Genetic analyses><Genotype><Germ Lines><Heritability><Individual><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Investments><Linear Regressions><Link><Linkage Mapping><MAP Kinase 3><MAPK3><MAPK3 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase><MAPK3 gene><Maps><Measures><Mediating><Methodology><Methods><Minority><Mission><Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3><Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3 Gene><Modeling><Molecular Interaction><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neurons><Non-Coding><Non-Coding RNA><Non-translated RNA><Noncoding RNA><Nontranslated RNA><Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions><Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences><P44ERK1><PSTkinase p44mpk><Persons><Phenotype><Population><Predictive Value><Proliferating><Publishing><QTL><Quantitative Trait Loci><RNA Splicing><Regulation><Regulatory Element><Regulatory Regions><Research><Research Design><Risk><Sample Size><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Splicing><Study Type><Subcellular Process><Techniques><Time><Tissues><Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping><Transcript Expression Analyses><Transcript Expression Analysis><Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene><Transcription factor genes><United States National Institutes of Health><Untranslated RNA><Variant><Variation><Work><allele variant><allelic variant><analyze gene expression><autoimmune condition><autoimmune disorder><autoimmunity disease><benchmark><candidate biomarker><candidate marker><causal allele><causal gene><causal mutation><causal variant><causative mutation><causative variant><cell type><clinical relevance><clinically relevant><cohort><computer based prediction><dementia praecox><driving><epigenetically><feature selection><gene expression analysis><gene expression assay><gene locus><genetic analysis><genetic association><genetic locus><genetic mapping><genetic regulatory element><genetic variant><genome scale><genome wide association><genome wide association scan><genome wide association studies><genome wide association study><genome-wide><genomewide><genomewide association scan><genomewide association studies><genomewide association study><genomic location><genomic locus><genomic variant><global gene expression><global transcription profile><high dimensionality><human disease><improved><innovate><innovation><innovative><insight><interventional strategy><neuronal><noncoding><novel><p44 MAPK><polygenic risk score><predictive modeling><scRNA-seq><schizophrenic><single cell RNA-seq><single cell RNAseq><single cell expression profiling><single cell transcriptomic profiling><single-cell RNA sequencing><statistics><study design><therapeutic agent development><therapeutic development><three dimensional><tool><trait><transcription factor><transcriptional profiling><transcriptome><transcriptomics><whole genome association analysis><whole genome association studies><whole genome association study>,Biotechnology; Genetics; Human Genome

widely and identifying individuals with poor or advantageous future outcomes would help to optimize treatment
planning and resource allocation. Furthermore, antipsychotics are associated with adverse side effects, such as
increased risk of diabetes. In this application, we propose to use machine learning approaches to build predictors
and identify subtypes of clinical outcomes among individuals with schizophrenia, through integration of
longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), dimensional phenotyping, and genetic analyses. We will also
explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. Our long-term objective is to
advance the goals of Precision Psychiatry to achieve individualized treatment planning, outcome monitoring, and
preventive interventions. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Leverage two independent EHR
databases for outcome prediction and sub-classification of psychosis-related disorders. (a) We will use
the longitudinal PSYCKES and MarketScan databases to build machine learning-based individual-level
prediction models to forecast the onset of four major prognostic outcomes: treatment response (antipsychotic
resistance), illness severity (long-term hospitalization), medical comorbidity (diabetes), and diagnostic transition
from a psychosis-related disorder to schizophrenia. (b) We will perform cohort-level analyses using unsupervised
methods to discover novel psychosis-related diagnosis and prognosis subtypes. Aim 2: Enhance predictive
modeling through dimensional phenotyping and whole genome sequencing. (a) We will recruit n = 10,000
patients with schizophrenia from the PSYCKES database population for enriched data collection: 1) dimensional
phenotyping (cognition, exposome, and social determinants of health), and 2) whole genome sequencing to
enable calling of rare variants, structural variants, and common variants (polygenic risk). (b) We will investigate
the extent to which dimensional phenotypes and genomic data can improve the models developed in Aim 1. Aim
3: Explore the psychosocial and ethical implications of psychiatric clinical predictors. (a) We will survey
a subset of patients and their clinicians regarding their attitudes towards implementation of clinical outcome
predictors. (b) We will return pathogenic findings to patients through genetic counseling and survey the
experience of patients and their clinicians on their emotional reactions and perceptions of impairment, treatability,
and life-planning.",<AI system><Address><Antipsychotic Agents><Antipsychotic Drugs><Antipsychotics><Artificial Intelligence><Attitude><CLIA accredited><CLIA approved><CLIA certified><CLIA compliant><CLIA licensed><Classification><Clinical><Code><Coding System><Cognition><Computer Analysis><Computer Reasoning><Consensus><Consent><Copy Number Polymorphism><DNA><Data><Data Analytics><Data Base Management><Data Base Management Systems><Data Bases><Data Collection><Database Management Systems><Databases><Deoxyribonucleic Acid><Diabetes Mellitus><Diagnosis><Diagnostic><Dimensions><Disease><Disorder><Electronic Health Record><Ethics><Functional RNA><Future><Genetic><Genetic Counseling><Genetic analyses><Goals><Impairment><Individual><Institutionalization><Insurance><Interview><Knowledge><Life><Machine Intelligence><Machine Learning><Major Tranquilizers><Major Tranquilizing Agents><Medicaid><Medical><Medicine><Mental Health><Mental Hygiene><Methods><Modeling><Monitor><Nature><Neuroleptic Agents><Neuroleptic Drugs><Neuroleptics><New York><Non-Coding><Non-Coding RNA><Non-translated RNA><Noncoding RNA><Nontranslated RNA><Outcome><Pathogenicity><Patient Recruitments><Patients><Perception><Personalized medical approach><Persons><Pharmacological Treatment><Phenotype><Population><Population Database><Preventative intervention><Prognosis><Psychiatry><Psychological Health><Psychoses><Public Health><Recovery><Refractory><Research><Resistance><Resource Allocation><Risk><Sampling><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Services><Severity of illness><Site><Specialty><Study models><Survey Instrument><Surveys><System><Systematics><Untranslated RNA><Validation><Variant><Variation><biobank><biorepository><cardiometabolic><cardiometabolism><chronic mental illness><clinical decision-making><clinical implementation><clinical practice><clinical predictive model><clinical predictors><clinical subtypes><co-morbid><co-morbidity><cohort><comorbidity><computational analyses><computational analysis><computer analyses><computer based prediction><copy number variant><copy number variation><customized therapy><customized treatment><data base><database management><database systems><dementia praecox><diabetes><diabetes risk><disease severity><electronic health care record><electronic health medical record><electronic health plan record><electronic health registry><electronic medical health record><emotional reaction><entire genome><ethical><experience><full genome><genetic analysis><genetic information><genome sequencing><genomic data><genomic data-set><genomic dataset><improved><individual patient><individualized approach><individualized medicine><individualized patient treatment><individualized therapeutic strategy><individualized therapy><individualized treatment><intervention for prevention><long term hospitalization><longterm hospitalization><machine based learning><medical specialties><meeting><meetings><model building><mortality><multidisciplinary><noncoding><novel><outcome prediction><participant recruitment><patient specific therapies><patient specific treatment><patient subclass><patient subcluster><patient subgroups><patient subpopulations><patient subsets><patient subtypes><persistent mental illness><personalized approach><phenotypic data><precision approach><precision medicine><precision-based medicine><predict clinical outcome><predictive modeling><prevention intervention><preventional intervention strategy><preventive intervention><prognostic><prospective><psychosocial><rare allele><rare mutation><rare variant><recruit><relational database management systems><resistant><response to therapy><response to treatment><schizophrenic><serious mental disorder><serious mental illness><severe mental disorder><severe mental illness><side effect><social health determinants><standard of care><tailored approach><tailored medical treatment><tailored therapy><tailored treatment><therapeutic response><therapy optimization><therapy response><tool><treatment optimization><treatment planning><treatment response><treatment responsiveness><unique treatment><validations><whole genome>,Behavioral and Social Science; Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Genetics; Human Genome; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Patient Safety; Precision Medicine; Psychosis; Schizophrenia; Serious Mental Illness; Social Determinants of Health
Prebiotic Treatment in People with Schizophrenia,Prebiotic Treatment in People with Schizophrenia,"PROJECT SUMMARY
People with schizophrenia have a broad range of cognitive impairments, which are major determinants of the
poor functional outcome observed in people with this disorder. Unfortunately, pharmacological and non-
pharmacological interventions have limited benefits for these impairments. In the absence of effective
treatments, cognitive impairments remain a critical unmet therapeutic need, and the development of novel
approaches for their treatment remains a central therapeutic challenge. Over the past 10 years, considerable
evidence has emerged to suggest that the gut microbiota has significant effects on brain development and
behavior, in part, through the regulation of immune system function. The gut microbiota affects immune system
function through the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other mechanisms. There are three
major SCFAs: butyrate, propionate, and acetate, of which, butyrate appears to have the most pronounced
effects on the immune system. Prebiotics are dietary fibers that promote the growth or activity of gut
microorganisms, which leads to enhanced well-being of the host; they have been shown to increase the activity
of multiple different bacteria species, including butyrate-producing bacteria. In light of the emerging evidence
that suggests schizophrenia is characterized by multiple abnormalities of the immune system, which lead to a
pro-inflammatory state, the proposed R61 and R33 projects are designed to evaluate the hypothesis that
prebiotic administration will lead to increased production of butyrate, through increased activity of butyrate-
producing bacteria in the gut microbiota; the increase in serum butyrate levels will be associated with changes
in cognitive function, symptoms, and metabolic measures. In the R61 project, we will conduct a 10-day,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (RCT) to determine if the prebiotic: Prebiotin
(12g/day), an oligofructose-enriched inulin (FOS), alters the hypothesized biological signature, i.e., increases
serum butyrate levels. We will use an inulin-challenge paradigm to asses the effect of FOS on serum butyrate
levels. In the R33 project, we will conduct a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, RCT, to confirm the
ability of the prebiotic: FOS (12g/day), to alter the hypothesized biological signature: serum butyrate levels. We
will also examine the extent to which changes in serum butyrate levels are associated with changes in
cognitive function, symptoms, and metabolic measures. We will use the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive
Battery to assess change in cognitive function. The study will provide critical preliminary data on the clinical
utility of prebiotic treatment for the improvement of cognitive function in people with schizophrenia.",<Acetates><Affect><Affective Symptoms><After Care><After-Treatment><Aftercare><Attention><Bacteria><Behavior><Biological><Blood Serum><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Butyrates><Cholesterol><Chromatin Structure><Chromosome 6><Clinical><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><D-Glucose><Data><Development><Dextrose><Dietary Fiber><Disease><Disorder><Disturbance in cognition><Double-Blind Method><Double-Blind Study><Double-Blinded><Double-Masked Method><Double-Masked Study><Encephalon><Enzyme Gene><Enzymes><Family><Fasting><GI microbiome><GI microbiota><Gastrointestinal microbiota><Gene Expression><Generalized Growth><Genetic Polymorphism><Glucose><Growth><Gut Epithelial Permeability><Gut Hyperpermeability><Gut permeability><HDAC Agent><HDAC inhibitor><Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor><Histone deacetylase inhibition><Hortega cell><IQ Deficit><Immediate Memory><Immune system><Immunomodulation><Impaired cognition><Impairment><Incidence><Inflammatory><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Intestinal Epithelial Permeability><Intestinal Hyperpermeability><Intestinal permeability><Inulin><Light><Lipids><MATRICS><MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery><Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia><Measures><Mediating><Memory><Metabolic><Microglia><Multiple Abnormalities><Neurocognitive Deficit><Non-pharmacologic Therapy><Nonpharmacologic Intervention><Nonpharmacologic Therapy><Nonpharmacologic approach><Nonpharmacologic treatment><Nuclear><Outcome><Participant><Pathway interactions><Performance><Personal Satisfaction><Persons><Pharmacological Treatment><Photoradiation><Placebos><Production><Propionates><Randomized><Receptor Protein><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Secondary to><Serum><Sham Treatment><Short-Chain Fatty Acids><Short-Term Memory><Shortterm Memory><Symptoms><Therapeutic><Tissue Growth><Triacylglycerol><Triglycerides><Verbal Learning><Volatile Fatty Acids><bacteria in the gut><biologic><cognitive benefits><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive function><cognitive loss><cognitive performance><cytokine><dementia praecox><design><designing><developmental><digestive tract microbiome><effective intervention><effective therapy><effective treatment><efficacy trial><enteric microbial community><enteric microbiome><enteric microbiota><executive control><executive function><fasted><fasts><functional outcomes><gastrointestinal microbial flora><gastrointestinal microbiome><gitter cell><gut bacteria><gut commensal><gut community><gut flora><gut microbe community><gut microbial community><gut microbial composition><gut microbial consortia><gut microbiome><gut microbiota><gut microbiotic><gut microflora><gut-associated microbiome><immune modulation><immune regulation><immune system function><immunologic reactivity control><immunomodulatory><immunoregulation><immunoregulatory><improved><intelligence quotient deficit><interest><interventional strategy><intestinal barrier><intestinal biome><intestinal flora><intestinal microbiome><intestinal microbiota><intestinal microflora><intestinal mucosal barrier><intestinal tract microflora><mesoglia><microbiota composition><microglial cell><microgliocyte><microorganism><neurocognitive decline><neurocognitive impairment><new approaches><non-drug therapy><non-drug treatment><nondrug therapy><nondrug treatment><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><ontogeny><pathway><perivascular glial cell><pharmacologic><polymorphism><post treatment><prebiotics><processing speed><psychiatric symptom><randomisation><randomization><randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial><randomly assigned><receptor><recruit><schizophrenic><sham therapy><side effect><social cognition><visual learning><well-being><wellbeing><whole grain><working memory>,Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Complementary and Integrative Health; Dietary Supplements; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Microbiome; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Schizophrenia; Serious Mental Illness
Use of DVC® systems to acquire and remotely view data for improved monitoring of animal models and their environment.,Use of DVC® systems to acquire and remotely view data for improved monitoring of animal models and their environment.,"ABSTRACT
This application requests funds to acquire specialized laboratory mouse housing systems- Digital Ventilated
Caging (DVC) designed to initiate a new generation of husbandry, breeding colony and animal welfare
management, and research data acquisition. The requested equipment will improve NKI’s animal housing by
establishing an ability for 24-hour remote monitoring of the cage microenvironment, promoting health, less
disturbance of cage inhabitants, and normal baseline behavior and physiology, conditions necessary to
produce more accurate animal models in brain-and-behavior studies. Such models, which, at NKI, aim at
understanding the molecular basis of normal and diseased states, also have improved translational usefulness,
including the development of early diagnostic and treatment abilities. Long-term monitoring of the behavior
and activity of mice in their natural environment using non-intrusive methods in their home cages can better
reveal their behavior and activity in their natural environment. Using home cage monitoring devices to track
the activity levels of mice, researchers can evaluate phenotypic expression of inserted or deleted genes as well
as the effectiveness of interventions, such as exercise and pharmaceutical treatments, on activity levels and all
while improving overall general health and husbandry. The DVC systems, as a shared resource, will be used to
provide GEM (genetically modified mice) models for multiple studies supported by funding from the NIH,
Alzheimer’s Association, Jerome LeJeune Foundation, New Vision Research, the Dr. Ralph and Marian Falk
Medical Research Trust, and the Templeton World Charity Foundation. Upgrading and modernizing animal
caging systems along with continued Institutional funding for facility improvements further the NKI animal care
and use program toward AAALAC accreditation.",<AD dementia><Accreditation><Aging><Alzheimer Type Dementia><Alzheimer disease dementia><Alzheimer sclerosis><Alzheimer syndrome><Alzheimer's><Alzheimer's Disease><Alzheimers Dementia><Animal Experimental Use><Animal Experimentation><Animal Housing><Animal Model><Animal Models and Related Studies><Animal Research><Animal Welfare><Animals><Behavior><Behavior monitoring><Biological Markers><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Breeding><Caring><Charities><Communication><Data><Data Collection><Degenerative Neurologic Disorders><Development><Diagnostic><Disease><Disorder><Ecologic Monitoring><Ecological Monitoring><Effectiveness of Interventions><Emotions><Encephalon><Environment><Environmental Monitoring><Equipment><Evaluation><Exercise><Foundations><Funding><Gene Deletion><Gene Modified><Generations><Grant><Health><Health Promotion><Home><Hour><Housing><Institution><Investigators><Laboratory mice><Measurement><Medical Research><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modeling><Modernization><Molecular><Monitor><Murine><Mus><NIH><NIH RFA><National Institutes of Health><Nervous System Degenerative Diseases><Neural Degenerative Diseases><Neural degenerative Disorders><Neurodegenerative Diseases><Neurodegenerative Disorders><Neurologic Degenerative Conditions><Pathologic><Pathology><Pharmaceutical Agent><Pharmaceuticals><Pharmacologic Substance><Pharmacological Substance><Phenotype><Physiology><Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia><Request for Applications><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Resource Sharing><Rodent><Rodentia><Rodents Mammals><Running><Salutogenesis><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Scientist><Sleep><System><Technology><Transgenic Mice><Transgenic Organisms><Treatment outcome><Trust><United States National Institutes of Health><Vision research><accredited><animal care><animal experimentations><animal facility><behavior study><behavioral monitoring><behavioral study><bio-markers><biologic marker><biomarker><data acquisition><data acquisitions><degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons><degenerative neurological diseases><dementia praecox><design><designing><developmental><digital><environmental testing><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><gene deletion mutation><gene modification><genetically modified><homes><improved><model of animal><monitoring device><mouse model><murine model><neurodegenerative illness><pharmaceutical><primary degenerative dementia><programs><promoting health><remote monitoring><schizophrenic><senile dementia of the Alzheimer type><transgenic><ventilation>,Aging; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Neurosciences; Prevention
Alternative Stimulation Mode and Location for Auditory Hallucination Neuromodulation Treatment,Alternative Stimulation Mode and Location for Auditory Hallucination Neuromodulation Treatment,"Project summary: Current efforts to use rTMS to treat auditory hallucinations refractory to available
antipsychotic medications show promising efficacy but replicability of the effect in well-controlled clinical trials
remain unsatisfactory. The proposed study is to use a novel approach to design rTMS treatment for auditory
hallucination that is based on a strong neural circuitry mechanism on auditory hallucination formation. The
project will recruit patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and randomize patients into active rTMS
versus sham rTMS groups followed by four fMRI based target engagement outcome assessments at baseline
and after 10, and 20 visits of daily rTMS plus a 2 week maintenance phase. The proposal will use new
stimulation site and stimulation mode combinations that are different from previous rTMS trials on auditory
hallucination, but are conceptualized to be more closely linked to neural circuitry mechanisms of auditory
halluciantion formation. The proposal will include two phases as two separate projects. The first proposed
project is a R61 for two years. If the Go/Nogo milestones are not met, the study will end. If all Go/Nogo
milestones are met, it will proceed to a R33 project for three more years. The trial will test the proposed
mechanism of action at brain circuitry level and determine whether the new stimulation site and mode strategy
will indeed significantly engage the proposed circuitry of action through modulating its functional connectivity in
the direction for improving auditory hallucination.",<Acute><Address><Antipsychotic Agents><Antipsychotic Drugs><Antipsychotics><Area><Auditory><Auditory Cortex><Auditory Hallucination><Auditory area><Blinded><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Clinical><Controlled Clinical Trials><Data><Decision Making><Disease><Disorder><Dose><Drugs><Encephalon><Follow-Up Studies><Followup Studies><Functional MRI><Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Hearing><Individual><Linguistic><Linguistics><Link><Location><Maintenance><Major Tranquilizers><Major Tranquilizing Agents><Medication><Modeling><Neuroleptic Agents><Neuroleptic Drugs><Neuroleptics><Outcome Assessment><Participant><Patient Recruitments><Patients><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phase><Prefrontal Cortex><QOL><Quality of life><Randomized><Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials><Refractory><Research><Rest><Role><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Site><Symptoms><System><Techniques><Testing><Transcranial magnetic stimulation><Treatment Period><Visit><Voice><active method><active technique><active treatment><anatomic imaging><anatomical imaging><association cortex><association cortical><association cortices><brain circuitry><clinical efficacy><dementia praecox><design><designing><drug/agent><electric field><experience><fMRI><functional outcomes><improved><indexing><neural circuit><neural circuitry><neural control><neural imaging><neural regulation><neuro-imaging><neurocircuitry><neuroimaging><neurological imaging><neuromodulation><neuromodulatory><neuroregulation><new approaches><novel><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><participant recruitment><randomisation><randomization><randomized control clinical trial><randomly assigned><recruit><repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation><schizophrenia spectrum><schizophrenia spectrum disorder><schizophrenic><social role><synaptic circuit><synaptic circuitry><trait><treatment days><treatment duration><treatment effect><treatment site>,Biomedical Imaging; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Psychosis; Schizophrenia; Serious Mental Illness
Novel and Rigorous Statistical Learning and Inference for Comparative Effectiveness Research with Complex Data,Novel and Rigorous Statistical Learning and Inference for Comparative Effectiveness Research with Complex Data,"Project Summary
 Comparative effectiveness research (CER) in medicine is commonly conducted to discover and provide infor-
mation on possible differences between alternative drugs or treatments in their effectiveness and safety. Such
information, if reliable and accurate, can help patients, clinicians, and other healthcare stakeholders to make
better-informed healthcare decisions and improve healthcare delivery and outcomes. However, drawing valid
and relevant inferences about treatment effects from observational studies involves effort and expertise from
both subject-matter researchers and statisticians. On one hand, causal inference relies on structural assump-
tions. Two prominent classes of such assumptions are unconfoundedness or instrument variable (IV) assump-
tions. On the other hand, granted the structural assumptions, causal inference also requires statistical modeling
and estimation of population properties and associations from empirical data. The problem of statistical learning
and inference can be challenging, while allowing a large number of candidate regressors such as main effects
and interactions of covariates. The objective of our research is to develop, evaluate, and disseminate a new
set of theoretically rigorous, numerically automated, and practically useful methods of statistical learning and
inference for estimating treatment effects in CER with complex, high-dimensional data. Three specific aims
are (1) high-dimensional inference about population and subpopulation average treatment effects under uncon-
foundedness with multi-valued treatments, (2) high-dimensional inference about local average treatment effects
and IV-dependent average treatment effects on the treated with multi-valued instruments and treatments, and
(3) high-dimensional inference about average treatment effects such as contrasts between survival and hazard
probabilities with longitudinal and survival data. We will investigate applications of the new methods to several
comparative effectiveness and safety studies including a recent study on comparative treatment strategies in
schizophrenia and an ongoing project to evaluate the therapeutic exchangeability of same-class drugs, for ex-
ample, direct oral anticoagulants among patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter or dipeptidyl peptidase-4
inhibitors among patients with type 2 diabetes, while exploiting IVs created by the design of the Medicare pre-
scription drug benefit. We will develop and publicly release user-friendly computer software including transparent
documentation for direct implementation of the new methods.","<Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus><Anticoagulant Agents><Anticoagulant Drugs><Anticoagulants><Applied Research><Applied Science><Atrial Fibrillation><Atrial Flutter><Auricular Fibrillation><Auricular Flutter><Calibration><Collaborations><Comparative Effectiveness Research><Complex><Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)><Confounding Variables><Data><Dipeptidyl Aminopeptidases><Dipeptidyl Peptidases><Dipeptidylpeptide Hydrolases><Documentation><Drug Prescribing><Drug Prescriptions><Drugs><Effectiveness><Epidemiologic Confounding Factor><Epidemiologic Research><Epidemiologic Studies><Epidemiological Studies><Epidemiology Research><Grant><Health><Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18><Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18><Healthcare><Healthcare Delivery><Investigators><Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus><Machine Learning><Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus><Measures><Medical><Medicare><Medication><Medicine><Methods><Modeling><NIDDM><Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes><Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus><Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes><Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus><Observation research><Observation study><Observational Study><Observational research><Oral><Outcome><Patients><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Population><Predisposition><Probabilistic Models><Probability><Probability Models><Process><Property><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Resort><Risk Factors><Safety><Schedule><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus><Stable Diabetes Mellitus><Statistical Data Analyses><Statistical Data Analysis><Statistical Data Interpretation><Statistical Methods><Statistical Models><Susceptibility><T2 DM><T2D><T2DM><Therapeutic><Title 18><Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus><Type 2 diabetes><Type II Diabetes Mellitus><Type II diabetes><Uncertainty><Variant><Variation><Work><adult onset diabetes><blood thinner><care outcomes><comparative effectiveness study><comparative treatment><complex data><computational resources><computing resources><data resource><dementia praecox><design><designing><develop software><developing computer software><doubt><drug/agent><epidemiologic investigation><epidemiology study><hazard><health and care delivery><health care><health care delivery><health care outcomes><health delivery systems><health insurance for disabled><health services delivery><healthcare outcomes><high dimensional data><high dimensionality><improved><inhibitor><instrument><ketosis resistant diabetes><machine based learning><machine learning based method><machine learning method><machine learning methodologies><maturity onset diabetes><medication prescription><model building><multidimensional data><multidimensional datasets><novel><prescribed medication><random forest><safety study><schizophrenic><software development><statistic methods><statistical analysis><statistical learning><statistical linear mixed models><statistical linear models><statistics><thrombopoiesis inhibitor><treatment effect><treatment group><treatment strategy><type 2 DM><type II DM><type two diabetes><user friendly computer software><user friendly software>",Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Data Science; Health Services; Heart Disease; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Patient Safety
Modulating Endogenous Opiate Signaling to Reverse Stress-Induced Deficits in Reward Processing,Modulating Endogenous Opiate Signaling to Reverse Stress-Induced Deficits in Reward Processing,"Project Abstract
Millions of Americans suffer from deficits in reward processing, in the context of psychiatric disorders including
major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Disrupted reward processing leads to worse outcomes, yet
current treatments poorly treat this symptom and new treatments are urgently needed. Recent evidence that
mu opioid antagonists function as antidepressants suggest the opioid system as a promising line for
developing novel treatments. We hypothesize that increasing endogenous enkephalins by using molecules
(DENKIs) that inhibit the degradation of this endogenous class of opioid peptides will reverse reward seeking
deficits without raising the liability for substance use disorders. To test this hypothesis and extend our
preliminary data, we will administer a DENKI to chronically stressed mice and record in vivo neural activity in
the reward circuitry (ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc)) as the freely moving mice
engage in a reward task that assesses different aspects of reward processing. Using KO mice and receptor-
specific antagonists, in Aim 1, we will determine if these effects are mediated by MOR and in Aim 2, test
whether they are mediated by delta opioid receptor (DOR). We will also confirm that DENKI administration is
not inherently rewarding. Successful completion of these aims will yield novel insights into how the opioid
system influence reward circuity activity during behavior and establish the basis for more detailed study of
endogenous enkephalin modulators as treatments for the anhedonia commonly seen in psychiatric disorders.","<3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine><4-Aminobutanoic Acid><4-Aminobutyric Acid><4-amino-butanoic acid><5-HT><5-Hydroxytryptamine><5HT><Acute><American><Aminalon><Aminalone><Anhedonia><Assay><Behavior><Binding><Bioassay><Biological Assay><CD10 Antigens><Categories><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Chronic><Chronic stress><Clinical><Communication><Data><Dysfunction><Enkephalin Receptors><Enkephalinase><Enkephalins><Enteramine><Female><Functional disorder><Future><GABA><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic defect><Hippophaine><Hydrogen Oxide><Infusion><Infusion procedures><Injections><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><KO mice><Knock-out><Knock-out Mice><Knockout><Knockout Mice><MDMA><Major Depressive Disorder><Measures><Mediating><Membrane Metalloendopeptidase><Mental disorders><Mental health disorders><Methylenedioxymethamphetamine><Mice><Mice Mammals><Molecular Interaction><Motivation><Murine><Mus><Mutation><N,alpha-dimethyl-1,3-benzodioxole-5-ethanamine><N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine><Neprilysin><Nerve Cells><Nerve Transmitter Substances><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neurons><Neurotransmitters><Neutral Endopeptidase><Nucleus Accumbens><Null Mouse><Opiate Antagonist><Opiate Peptides><Opiate Receptors><Opiate agonist><Opiate receptor agonist><Opiate receptor antagonist><Opiates><Opioid><Opioid Antagonist><Opioid Peptide><Opioid Receptor><Opioid agonist><Opioid receptor agonist><Opioid receptor antagonist><Outcome><Patients><Physiopathology><Play><Process><Psychiatric Disease><Psychiatric Disorder><Receptor Protein><Rewards><Risk><Role><SSRI><SSRIs><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor><Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor><Serotonin><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Site><Stress><Substance Use Disorder><Symptoms><System><Testing><Therapeutic Agents><Ventral Tegmental Area><Water><abuse liability><abuse potential><addiction><addictive disorder><antagonism><antagonist><anti-depressant agent><anti-depressant drugs><anti-depressants><anti-depressive agents><behavior change><biological signal transduction><clinical depression><conditioned place preference><delta opioid receptor><dementia praecox><ecstasy><endogenous opiate><endogenous opioids><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><gamma-Aminobutyric Acid><genome mutation><hedonic><improved><in vivo><infusions><inhibitor><insight><major depression><major depression disorder><male><mental illness><mu opioid receptors><neural><neuronal><novel><pathophysiology><patient subclass><patient subcluster><patient subgroups><patient subpopulations><patient subsets><patient subtypes><place conditioning><preference><prevent><preventing><psychiatric illness><psychiatric symptom><psychological disorder><receptor><response><reward circuitry><reward processing><schizophrenic><serotonin reuptake inhibitor><side effect><social defeat><social role><substance use and disorder><symptom treatment><symptomatic treatment><treat symptom><ventral tegmentum><γ-Aminobutyric Acid><δ OR><δ ORs><δ opioid receptors><δ-OR><δ-ORs><δOR><δORs><μ opioid receptors><μ-OR><μOR>",Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Depression; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Opioids
Terminal type-specific cannabinoid CB1 receptor alterations in schizophrenia and cannabis use,Terminal type-specific cannabinoid CB1 receptor alterations in schizophrenia and cannabis use,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) use cannabis at a high rate, which exacerbates SZ symptoms and worsens
long-term prognosis. Recent studies suggest that while individuals with genetic risks for SZ are more likely to
use cannabis, cannabis users are also at a dually (i.e., genetically and pharmacologically) increased risk for the
expression of SZ related symptoms. The psychoactive substance in cannabis, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),
targets the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R) in the brain. I recently showed
that CB1R is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory axon terminals in the human dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (DLPFC) – a region implicated in working memory impairments of SZ. Then, I found increased CB1R in
excitatory terminals, and decreased CB1R in inhibitory terminals, in the DLPFC of SZ subjects without comorbid
cannabis use. Conversely, in a pilot analysis of THC-exposed rats, I saw decreased CB1R in inhibitory terminals
in the prelimbic cortex (PrL) – a functional homolog of the DLPFC – but no changes in excitatory terminals. I now
propose to expand on these results to characterize the independent and additive effects of SZ and cannabis use
on terminal type-specific CB1R expression and signaling, and resulting functional alterations. I hypothesize that
individuals with SZ have terminal type-specific CB1R aberrations that contribute to impaired working memory.
THC exposure then intensifies these terminal type-specific CB1R changes, further worsening working memory.
I will test this hypothesis using the synergistic strengths of cross-species analyses, through a set of postmortem
and rat experimental Aims, to clarify the effects of findings observed in human samples with preclinical studies.
Multi-label immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy will be used to define the terminal type-specific CB1R
alterations in the DLPFC of SZ individuals with and without comorbid cannabis use (Aim 1). Viral manipulations
and intravenous rat THC self-administration, followed by working memory tests, will be used to delineate how
terminal type-specific CB1R changes and THC exposure alter working memory (Aim 2). Proximity labeling and
targeted mass spectrometry will be used to compare terminal type-specific CB1R phosphopeptide alterations in
the DLPFC of SZ individuals with and without comorbid cannabis use, and the PrL of rats with and without THC
exposure (Aim 3). Integrated with the scientific Aims is training to 1) Develop expertise in translational studies of
SZ cortical cell and circuit pathology. 2) Acquire expertise in the design and execution of in vivo viral mediated
gene transfer. 3) Train in the design and execution of THC self-administration. 4) Enhance knowledge of GPCR
signaling biology using phosphoproteomics. 5) Learn advanced biostatistics to analyze complex postmortem and
rodent datasets. Achieving these Aims will identify the independent and additive effects of SZ and cannabis use

"Transforming mental health care via science-based, personalizable and scalable digital therapeutics","Transforming mental health care via science-based, personalizable and scalable digital therapeutics","Project Summary_Abstract
 Mental health problems are increasing worldwide; however, the vast majority of people struggling with
mental health challenges do not receive any treatment and the mental health workforce is woefully insufficient
to meet our population-level needs. Digital Therapeutics (DTx) are optimally positioned to tackle these
challenges and transform mental health care. DTx are clinical-grade software used to prevent, treat, or
manage a medical disorder or disease. DTx can have a major impact on health costs, health behavior, and
health outcomes. For example, DTx can effectively treat depression, anxiety, ADHD, panic disorder and eating
disorders, among many other mental health conditions. And, they are associated with marked reductions in ED
visits, inpatient utilization, and net costs, and increases in medication adherence.
Despite their impressive clinical value, several challenges persist in fully realizing the potential of DTx
to improve people’s lives globally. First, the pace at which DTx are developed, tested, and commercialized is
slow. Second, many development activities are redundant across projects. Third, due to budget, time and
capacity constraints, many scientists develop prototypes of DTx that can be used in research but which are not
built to scale for large numbers of users. Finally, most DTx cannot be readily modified for various populations
critical for advancing digital health equity (adapted to culture, language, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation).
 Based on over two decades of NIH-supported work developing, evaluating and commercializing DTx, we
have developed a unique DTx platform (Laddr) which integrates science-based, therapeutic processes to
address a wide range of behavioral problems within a single digital platform. This platform offers the potential
to revolutionize digital health - as it provides a scalable model for delivering DTx to treat any disorder with a
behavioral component. We now plan to make an editable version of Laddr (called Cogito) commercially
available to developers of DTx. Cogito will provide a turnkey solution for rapidly developing, evaluating,
deploying, and scaling DTx for the prevention, treatment and/or management of any disease or disorder - via a
drag and drop interface with no programming necessary.
 In this Phase 1 SBIR application, we will finalize several features of the Cogito platform to increase its
commercial potential as a turnkey platform for developing and hosting DTx. And we will assess the feasibility,
technical merit, and commercial potential of the Cogito DTx platform via usability testing with clinical
researchers. We will focus on the usability of Cogito with researchers in the mental health field in this initial
phase and then expand to a broad clinical research community focused on the prevention, treatment, or
management of various health conditions in future iterations of this work.
to markedly accelerate the pace and impact of science based DTx.
Overall, Cogito offers great promise",<21+ years old><AD/HD><ADHD><Acceleration><Accident and Emergency department><Achievement><Achievement Attainment><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Alcohol Chemical Class><Alcohols><Anxiety><Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder><Behavior><Behavior Conditioning Therapy><Behavior Modification><Behavior Therapy><Behavior Treatment><Behavioral><Behavioral Conditioning Therapy><Behavioral Modification><Behavioral Therapy><Behavioral Treatment><Binge eating disorder><Budgets><Cannabis><Caring><Charge><Clinical><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Communities><Computer software><Conditioning Therapy><Development><Diagnostic><Disease><Disease remission><Disorder><Drops><ED visit><ER visit><Eating Disorders><Emergency Department><Emergency care visit><Emergency department visit><Emergency hospital visit><Emergency room><Emergency room visit><Ethnic Origin><Ethnicity><Evaluation><Exercise><Funding><Future><Health><Health Care Costs><Health Care Providers><Health Costs><Health Personnel><Health behavior><Health behavior and outcomes><Healthcare><Healthcare Costs><Healthcare Providers><Healthcare worker><Inpatients><Investigators><Language><Learning><Medical><Mental Depression><Mental Health><Mental Health Services><Mental Hygiene><Mental Hygiene Services><Mental disorders><Mental health disorders><Modeling><NIH><National Institutes of Health><Nature><Nicotine><Opiates><Opioid><Pain Control><Pain Therapy><Pain management><Panic Disorder><Persons><Phase><Population><Position><Positioning Attribute><Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder><Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder><Prevention><Problem behavior><Process><Psychiatric Disease><Psychiatric Disorder><Psychological Health><Race><Races><Remission><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><SBIR><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Science><Scientist><Sex Orientation><Sexual Orientation><Small Business Innovation Research><Small Business Innovation Research Grant><Smoking><Software><Stimulant><Substance Use Disorder><Suicide><System><Target Populations><Testing><Therapeutic><Time><Transcend><United States National Institutes of Health><Work><adulthood><behavior change><behavior intervention><behavioral health><behavioral intervention><behavioral problem><chronic pain><chronic pain patient><commercialization><cost><dementia praecox><depression><developmental><diabetes management><diabetes mellitus management><diabetic management><digital delivery><digital health><digital platform><digital therapeutics><digital therapy><digital treatment><digitally deliver><drug adherence><drug compliance><evidence base><experience><fatal attempt><fatal suicide><functional improvement><health care><health care personnel><health care worker><health equity><health provider><health related behavior><health workforce><healthcare personnel><improve function><improved><improved functional outcomes><intent to die><interest><medical personnel><medication adherence><medication compliance><mental health care><mental healthcare><mental illness><mental training><multiple substance use><multisubstance use><pain treatment><panic anxiety syndrome><patient centered><patient oriented><patient with chronic pain><poly substance use><polysubstance use><prevent><preventing><prototype><psychiatric illness><psychological disorder><racial><racial background><racial origin><scale up><schizophrenic><skills><substance use><substance use and disorder><substance use treatment><substance using><suicide rate><suicides><therapeutic agent development><therapeutic development><tool><treatment provider><usability>,Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Chronic Pain; Clinical Research; Health Services; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Pain Research; Prevention; Serious Mental Illness; Substance Misuse; Telehealth
An Acute Exercise Intervention to Ameliorate Behavioral and Neurophysiological Indices of Inhibitory Control Deficits in Schizophrenia: A Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) Study,An Acute Exercise Intervention to Ameliorate Behavioral and Neurophysiological Indices of Inhibitory Control Deficits in Schizophrenia: A Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) Study,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Inhibitory control deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs), with clear
manifestations seen in psychophysiological, electrophysiological, and neuroanatomical measures of these
processes. Addressing these symptoms is of critical clinical relevance since they are a main predictor of negative
vocational and psychosocial outcomes. An intriguing set of findings has suggested physical activity and exercise
can have a positive effect on SSD symptomatology, but the exercise-linked neural changes that may result in
improved inhibitory control is unknown. Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) technologies enable the assessment
of cognitive control processes in participants using high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG) during task
performance and physical activity. During the F99 phase, using cutting-edge MoBI technologies, I will test if a
single acute walking intervention will mitigate behavioral and neurophysiological indices of inhibitory control
deficits in SSDs (Aim 1A) and if individuals with SSDs showing significant improvement in inhibitory control
performance and normalization of inhibition-related event-related-potential (ERP) components to neurotypical
adults have less severe psychosis symptoms (Aim 1B). In Aim 2, I examine the underlying structural-functional
neural bases and behavior of disturbances in cognitive control and sensory processing among people with and
at risk for SSDs. Upon completion of both phases, I will become a multimodal neuroimaging and computational
psychiatry expert in SSDs. Learning neuroimaging methods (fMRI) and computational models to stimulate the
complex dynamics of brain function and behavior, alongside environmental factors, will enable me to identify the
underlying mechanisms of SSDs and propel the field forward in developing personalized treatments. The training
received during the F99/K00 phases will prepare me for the transition to a faculty position at a R1 institution,
where I will lead a distinguished neuroscience program and implement diversity initiatives to address issues
related to diversity and inclusion in neuroscience. As an expert in multimodal neuroimaging and computational
psychiatry, I will persist in exploring similar K00 research, now focusing on individuals who are D/deaf or hard-
of-hearing (D/HH) with psychosis to investigate variations of sensory-cognitive neural circuits generating auditory
and visual hallucinations, as well as develop personalized treatment algorithms. I am firmly committed to
providing practical, tractable solutions to individuals with SSDs through basic knowledge.",<21+ years old><Acute><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Aerobic Activity><Aerobic Exercise><Aerobic Training><Aerobic fitness><Age><Algorithms><Auditory Hallucination><Behavior><Behavioral><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Characteristics><Chronic Disease><Chronic Illness><Clinic><Clinical><Clinical Trials><Cognitive><Collaborations><Collection><Communication><Complex><Computer Models><Computerized Models><Data><Data Bases><Data Collection><Databases><Development><Disease><Disorder><Drugs><Dysfunction><EEG><Early Intervention><Electroencephalogram><Electroencephalography><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Encephalon><Environmental Factor><Environmental Risk Factor><Event-Related Potentials><Exercise><Faculty><Freedom><Functional MRI><Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Functional disorder><Generations><Goals><Human><IRB><IRBs><Image><Imaging technology><Individual><Individual Differences><Institution><Institutional Review Boards><Intervention><Intervention Strategies><Investigators><Knowledge><Lead><Learning><Liberty><Linear Regressions><Link><Medication><Mentors><Methods><Modeling><Modern Man><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neuranatomies><Neuranatomy><Neuroanatomies><Neuroanatomy><Neurocognition><Neurocyte><Neurons><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Neurosciences><Paper><Participant><Pb element><Performance><Persons><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Phase><Physical Exercise><Physical activity><Physiologic Psychology><Physiological Psychology><Physiopathology><Position><Positioning Attribute><Postdoc><Postdoctoral Fellow><Probabilistic Models><Probability Models><Process><Process Measure><Psychiatry><Psychopathology><Psychophysiological><Psychophysiology><Psychoses><R-Series Research Projects><R01 Mechanism><R01 Program><Randomized><Research><Research Associate><Research Grants><Research Personnel><Research Project Grants><Research Projects><Researchers><Risk><Role><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Sensory><Severities><Statistical Models><Stream><Symptoms><Task Performances><Technical Expertise><Techniques><Technology><Testing><Training><Universities><Variant><Variation><Visual Hallucination><Vocation><Walking><abnormal psychology><adulthood><ages><analysis pipeline><base><bases><chronic disorder><clinical relevance><clinically relevant><cognitive control><computational modeling><computational models><computer based models><computerized modeling><data base><deaf><deafened><deafness><dementia praecox><density><design><designing><developmental><diversity and inclusion><diversity and inclusivity><dosage><drug/agent><electrophysiological><empowerment><environmental risk><event related potential><exercise intervention><fMRI><fMRI/EEG><functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography><functional outcomes><hard of hearing><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><imaging><imaging study><improved><indexing><interventional strategy><multi-modal neuro-imaging><multi-modal neuroimaging><multimodal neuro-imaging><multimodal neuroimaging><neural><neural circuit><neural circuitry><neural imaging><neuro-imaging><neurocircuitry><neurocognitive disorder><neuroimaging><neurological imaging><neuronal><neurophysiological><neurophysiology><neuropsychiatric disease><neuropsychiatric disorder><next generation><novel><pathophysiology><personalization of treatment><personalized diagnosis><personalized diagnostics><personalized medicine><personalized therapy><personalized treatment><physical activity intervention><physiopsychology><post-doc><post-doctoral><post-doctoral trainee><pre-clinical study><precise diagnostics><precision diagnostics><preclinical study><profound hearing loss><programs><psycho-physiological><psychosocial outcome><psychosocial sequelae><randomisation><randomization><randomly assigned><recruit><research associates><response><schizophrenia risk><schizophrenia spectrum><schizophrenia spectrum disorder><schizophrenic><sex><skills><social role><statistical linear mixed models><statistical linear models><symptomatology><synaptic circuit><synaptic circuitry><technical skills><therapeutic target><treadmill><walking intervention>,Behavioral and Social Science; Biomedical Imaging; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Physical Activity; Prevention; Psychosis; Schizophrenia; Serious Mental Illness
Impact of developmental serotonin on prefrontal cortex parvalbumin interneuron excitability and cognitive behavior,Impact of developmental serotonin on prefrontal cortex parvalbumin interneuron excitability and cognitive behavior,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Sensitive periods are periods during early windows of development in external experiences or exposures
can shape patterns of connectivity and behavior later in life. Such periods allow for circuit maturation to adapt to
environmental factors but also confer risk for psychiatric disorders. Indeed, previous work in our lab has shown
that suppressing the activity of prefrontal parvalbumin-expressing (PFC PV) interneurons during postnatal day
14 to 32 (P14-P32) results in impaired neural connectivity, network function and PFC-dependent cognitive
flexibility later in life. Cognitive inflexibility and PFC dysfunction are both hallmarks of various psychiatric
illnesses, whose origins are often rooted in development. Thus, it is pivotal to understand the factors that
influence the activity of developing PFC PV interneurons, leading to alterations in PFC circuit remodeling.
 The neuromodulator serotonin (5-HT) is well positioned to influence the activity of developing PFC PV
cells. Indeed, the PFC is densely innervated by 5-HT and 5-HT receptors can be detected in the developing
PFC. Additionally, 5-HT modulates PFC PV activity in adulthood. Moreover, 5-HT release in development,
which can be caused various external and genetic factors, versus adulthood yields opposing effects on adult
cognition. For instance, increases in 5-HT release into the PFC in adulthood improves cognitive flexibility, and I
have demonstrated that potentiating 5-HT release in development (P12-21) impairs adult cognitive flexibility. I
hypothesize that P14-21 is a sensitive period during which potentiating 5-HT signaling may suppress PV
excitability with long-lasting consequences for cognitive behavior.
 My experiments are designed to elucidate mechanisms contributing to the developmental trajectories of
complex cognitive behavior and identify early risk factors of mental illness. In Aim 1, I investigate the direct
effects of 5-HT on developing PFC PV excitability by employing slice electrophysiology. In Aim 2, I examine
the net effects of 5-HT release into the PFC on PV interneuron activity using an in vivo model, optogenetics
and fiber photometry. With these experiments, I will test the hypothesis that 5-HT release during development
suppresses the activity of PFC PV interneurons and shifts into exciting PV in adulthood. In Aim 3, I evaluate
how 5-HT potentiation to the PFC alters cognitive flexibility using chemogenetics and cognitive flexibility
assays. With this experiment, I will test the hypothesis that developmental potentiation 5-HT release into the
PFC is sufficient and necessary to produce cognitive inflexibility.
 Overall, my goal for this proposal is to better understand how factors that affect 5-HT levels impact PFC
development and PFC-dependent cognitive behavior later in life. As PV interneurons are critical for PFC
maturation, their interactions with 5-HT may constitute important markers preceding the onset of disease.",<21+ years old><5-HT><5-HT Receptors><5-Hydroxytryptamine><5-Hydroxytryptamine Receptors><5HT><AD/HD><ADHD><Acute><Address><Adult><Adult Human><Affect><Assay><Attention><Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder><Behavior><Behavioral><Bioassay><Biological Assay><Birth><Causality><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cells><Chemosensitization><Chemosensitization/Potentiation><Cognition><Cognitive><Cognitive Disturbance><Cognitive Impairment><Cognitive decline><Cognitive function abnormal><Complex><Connector Neuron><Data><Development><Dimensions><Disease><Disorder><Disturbance in cognition><Dysfunction><Early identification><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Enteramine><Environmental Factor><Environmental Risk Factor><Etiology><Experimental Designs><Fiber><Functional disorder><Genetic><Goals><Hippophaine><Impaired cognition><Impairment><In Vitro><Intercalary Neuron><Intercalated Neurons><Interneurons><Internuncial Cell><Internuncial Neuron><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Investigators><Life><Mental Depression><Mental disorders><Mental health disorders><Mice><Mice Mammals><Murine><Mus><Neural Development><Neuromodulator><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Onset of illness><Opsin><P32><P32 isotope><Parturition><Parvalbumins><Pattern><Pharmaceutical Agent><Pharmaceuticals><Pharmacologic Substance><Pharmacological Substance><Phosphocol P32><Phosphorus 32><Phosphorus P32><Photometry><Physiopathology><Position><Positioning Attribute><Potentiation><Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder><Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder><Prefrontal Cortex><Prevention><Psychiatric Disease><Psychiatric Disorder><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Risk><Risk Factors><Rod-Opsin><Rodent><Rodentia><Rodents Mammals><SSRI><SSRIs><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor><Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor><Serotonin><Shapes><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Slice><Stress><Testing><Training><Viral><Virus><Work><adulthood><biological signal transduction><brain circuitry><causation><cognitive dysfunction><cognitive function><cognitive loss><dementia praecox><depression><developmental><disease causation><disease onset><disorder onset><electrophysiological><emotional behavior><environmental risk><experience><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><flexibility><flexible><implantation><improved><in vivo><in vivo Model><innervation><insight><interest><mental illness><nerve supply><neural><neural circuit><neural circuitry><neurocircuitry><neurodevelopment><optical fiber><optogenetics><pathophysiology><pharmaceutical><post-natal development><postnatal><postnatal development><psychiatric illness><psychological disorder><public health relevance><receptor expression><schizophrenic><serotonin receptor><serotonin reuptake inhibitor><synaptic circuit><synaptic circuitry>,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Mental Health; Neurosciences
Dissecting distinct contributions of different Prefrontal subregions on goal-directed visual attention,Dissecting distinct contributions of different Prefrontal subregions on goal-directed visual attention,"Visual attention is our ability to prioritize vision as a sensory modality, and our ability to extract discrete
information from a visual scene. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is considered a source of feedback modulation to
the visual cortex– guiding, biasing or modulating activity in the visual cortex, to produce visual attention. The
visual cortex of the mouse receives monosynaptic input from two discrete PFC subregions, the anterior cingulate
cortex (ACA) and the orbitofrontal cortex (ORB), that contribute to diverse aspects of cognition. However, it is
currently unknown how these distinct PFC subregions contribute to different aspects of visual attention. Equipped
with precise understanding of distinct forms of PFC feedback modulation on visual processing, we will be in a
better position to strategically intervene in disorders of visual processing and attention. The proposed work
therefore aims to bridge the long-standing hypothesis of PFC feedback modulation with changes in population
activity in the visual cortex, how this activity change alters visual processing, and ultimately what effect this has
on goal-directed visual attention. To achieve this goal, I will quantitively and qualitatively compare the activity of
ACA and ORB axons in the visual cortex during different behavioral epochs of visual attention (Aim 1), probing
each areas contribution to different aspects of vision. In following, perturbating the activity of each discrete PFC
output pathway, allows me to observe changes in population activity in the visual cortex, how this activity change
alters visual processing, and ultimately what effect this has on goal-directed visual attention (Aim 2). Finally, I
will target PFC output pathways with a distinct connectivity profile, to understand how these projections modulate
the activity of the visual cortex, and if they represent a distinct functional module in regulating sensory processing
(Aim 3). Understanding how discrete subregions of the PFC influence the activity of the visual cortex, and its
behavioral consequences, will provide key insights towards the cellular underpinnings of visual processing in the
brain.
The proposed work will be conducted at the Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department, MIT, with the direct
mentorship of Prof. Mriganka Sur (MIT), from which I have already benefitted experimental training in numerous
techniques including two-photon microscopy, visual cortex neurophysiology, circuit anatomy, and behavior. In
addition, I will receive training and guidance on optogenetic tools in combination with two-photon imaging, and
PFC physiology from Prof. Ofer Yizhar (WI), and computational methods in population activity analysis from Prof.
Mehrdad Jazayeri (MIT). The outlined research, training, and mentorship will facilitate my long-term goal of
establishing an independent researcher leveraging cutting-edge optical technologies available in mice to
understand how PFC feedback modulation optimizes goal-directed sensory processing in the cortex.",<2-photon><2-photon microscopy><AD/HD><ADHD><Anatomic Sites><Anatomic structures><Anatomy><Animals><Anterior><Area><Attention><Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder><Award><Axon><Behavior><Behavioral><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cognition><Cognitive Science><Communication><Complex><Computing Methodologies><Data><Disease><Disorder><Encephalon><Feedback><Future><Goals><Image><Investigators><Literature><Maps><Mentorship><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modality><Morphology><Murine><Mus><Nature><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neurons><Optics><Output><Pathway interactions><Phase><Physiologic><Physiological><Physiology><Population><Population Analysis><Position><Positioning Attribute><Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder><Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder><Prefrontal Cortex><Property><Publishing><Research><Research Personnel><Researchers><Rewards><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Sensory><Sight><Source><Structure><Techniques><Technology><Testing><Training><Viral><Vision><Vision Disorders><Visual><Visual Cortex><Visual Disorder><Visual Perception><Visual System><Visual attention><Work><cellular targeting><cingulate cortex><cognitive ability><cognitive psychology><computational methodology><computational methods><computer based method><computer methods><computing method><dementia praecox><imaging><insight><neural><neuronal><neurophysiological><neurophysiology><novel><optical><optogenetics><pathway><recruit><schizophrenic><tool><two photon excitation microscopy><two photon microscopy><two-photon><visual cortical><visual function><visual information><visual process><visual processing><visual stimulus>,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurosciences
Exploring the Contribution of Distinct mPFC Cell-Types to the Encoding of Decision-Making Outcome,Exploring the Contribution of Distinct mPFC Cell-Types to the Encoding of Decision-Making Outcome,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Cognitive rigidity is the inability to adapt behavior in a context-dependent manner. A
hallmark of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and
schizophrenia, cognitive rigidity is a debilitating symptom with limited therapeutic tools available
for promoting proper cognitive flexibility1,2. Currently, the field’s understanding of the neural
mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility are limited to several implicated brain regions with
little insight into the how the microcircuitry of these areas contributes to context-dependent rule
switching. Multiple studies point to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) as a critical hub for
cognitive flexibility, specifically for its encoding of response and outcome information1,2,3. The
proposed work aims to parse apart how information is encoded in different neuron types, how
disrupting the activity of these neuronal types impacts context-dependent decision making, and
how distinct neurotransmitter signaling onto these cells impacts behavioral flexibility. The
overarching goal is to understand the contributions of multiple cell-types in mPFC to the
updating of response and outcome task variables in response to changing reward
contingencies. Given the advent of genetic tools to target and manipulate genetically-defined
neuronal types in mPFC in mice, the goal of this project is to leverage tools such as calcium
imaging through cortical microprisms, optogenetic silencing of functionally-distinct neuronal
types, and cell-type-specific knockout of key receptors using CRISPR-Cas9 to explore this
microcircuitry.
 I have chosen to pursue this project at UCLA given its vast resources and highly
collaborative environment. Furthermore, the Golshani lab is an optimal setting for completing
the aims in this proposal due to its long history of using various calcium imaging and
optogenetic techniques. With existing access to mentors who are capable in these techniques,
as well as the tools themselves, I will quickly proceed through my proposed training plan and
become a capable systems neuroscientist. With both the support from experienced lab
members as well as the broader UCLA community, I believe that I am well equipped to succeed
and that the additional training and resources facilitated by this award will help me to fulfill my
goal of becoming an independent career scientist with my own lab at an R1 research university.",<2-photon><ASD><Address><Adverse effects><Animals><Area><Autism><Autistic Disorder><Automobile Driving><Award><Behavior><Behavioral><Behavioral Paradigm><Brain region><Business-Friendly Atmosphere><CRISPR approach><CRISPR based approach><CRISPR method><CRISPR methodology><CRISPR technique><CRISPR technology><CRISPR tools><CRISPR-CAS-9><CRISPR-based method><CRISPR-based technique><CRISPR-based technology><CRISPR-based tool><CRISPR/CAS approach><CRISPR/Cas method><CRISPR/Cas technology><CRISPR/Cas9><CRISPR/Cas9 technology><Calcium><Cas nuclease technology><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cells><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats approach><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats method><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats methodology><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technique><Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology><Cognitive><Communities><Connector Neuron><D1 receptor><DA Neuron><Decision Making><Development><Dopamine><Dopamine D1 Receptor><Dopamine Receptor><Dopamine neuron><Early Infantile Autism><Elements><Future><Genetic><Goals><History><Hydroxytyramine><Image><Impairment><Infantile Autism><Intercalary Neuron><Intercalated Neurons><Interneurons><Internuncial Cell><Internuncial Neuron><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Kanner's Syndrome><Knock-out><Knockout><Knowledge><Label><Measures><Medial><Mediating><Mentors><Mice><Mice Mammals><Murine><Mus><Nerve Cells><Nerve Transmitter Substances><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neurodevelopmental Disorder><Neurologic Disorders><Neurological Development Disorder><Neurological Disorders><Neurons><Neurotransmitters><Outcome><Output><PHM27><Performance><Population><Prefrontal Cortex><Proteins><Receptor Protein><Recording of previous events><Research><Research Resources><Resources><Rewards><Role><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Scientist><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><System><Task Performances><Techniques><Testing><Therapeutic><Training><Transgenic Mice><Universities><Update><Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide><Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide><Vasointestinal Peptide><Work><autism spectral disorder><autism spectrum disorder><autistic spectrum disorder><behavior outcome><behavioral outcome><biological signal transduction><business-friendly environment><career><cell type><cognitive rigidity><collaborative atmosphere><collaborative environment><debilitating symptom><dementia praecox><developmental><dimension reduction><dimensionality reduction><dopaminergic neuron><driving><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><flexibility><flexible><gene manipulation><genetic manipulation><genetically manipulate><genetically perturb><histories><imaging><insight><interactive atmosphere><interactive environment><interdisciplinary atmosphere><interdisciplinary environment><lab experience><lab training><laboratory experience><laboratory training><member><neural><neural circuit><neural circuitry><neural mechanism><neurocircuitry><neurodevelopmental disease><neurological disease><neuromechanism><neuronal><optogenetics><peer-group atmosphere><peer-group environment><receptor><reduce data dimension><reduce dimensionality><response><schizophrenic><social role><synaptic circuit><synaptic circuitry><tool><two-photon>,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Mental Health; Neurosciences
Training the next generation of clinical neuroscientists,Training the next generation of clinical neuroscientists,"The last decade has witnessed a surge in new research findings in neuroscience. So far, however, that
impressive progress has not translated into more effective treatments, or better outcomes, for patients with
serious mental illness. Although this may just be a matter of time, another contributing factor is the lack of
physician scientists in the field of clinical neuroscience. Physician scientists are uniquely capable of linking
basic science findings to the clinical phenomenology of psychiatric illness. Indeed, scientists like these - with
both clinical and research training - are uniquely poised to bridge the gap between basic neurobiology and
clinical disease. This combination is critical for advancing our understanding of the neurobiology of psychiatric
disorders - and for developing the highly needed disease-modifying treatments for psychiatric illnesses.
One of the explanations for the lack of clinician-scientists is the difficulty in obtaining grant funding right after
residency. This proposal aims to fill that gap. In a two-three year fellowship we will provide intense research
training for a select group of psychiatrists (or PhD psychologists). Upon completion, trainees should be able to
apply successfully for individual grants and develop into independent clinical neuroscientists. We aim to create
clinician-researchers who can combine clinical knowledge with superior research skills. The long-term goal is
to help shape the new generation of leaders in clinical neuroscience. Drs. Kahn, Malaspina and New are each
renowned physician scientists who combine clinical expertise with deep research and training experience.
This program will fill an important gap in the otherwise impressive translational research program at the Icahn
School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), recognized as a top ten innovative research engine worldwide by
Nature. Indeed, the Departments of Neuroscience and Psychiatry are ranked #1 and #6 respectively in NIH
funding. We already have extensive experience, and a successful track record, in supporting other research
career pathways, including a Physician-Scientist residency research track for MD, PhD trainees, and the first
Combined Psychiatry Residency and PhD Training program in the US, funded by an NIMH R25 grant, of which
Dr. New is PI. We also have 6 K awardees and 2 K99/R00 investigators in our rich training programs.
The proposed T32 fellowship program is designed to train psychiatrists and clinical PhDs to formulate original
research questions on etiology, pathogenesis, course, treatment and prevention of serious mental illness. Its
focus is on patients with schizophrenia and major mood disorders. Each trainee, paired with a mentor, will
formulate a career development plan with targeted goals for acquisition of skills, presentations, publications,
gathering pilot data, and preparation of proposals for external funding - usually a career development award.
Regular meetings, internally and with an external advisory board, will monitor trainee development in relevant
milestones. We aim to help fill the dearth in clinical neuroscientists so that the recent advances in
neuroscience can be translated into better care for the millions of patients with serious mental illness.",<Clinical><Training><next generation>,Mental Health

cortical excitation:inhibition (E:I) balance, and these models have inspired new outcome measures for
randomized control trials (RCTs), as well as new model paradigms for SZ. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether
computational models of E:I balance in SZ will spur innovations in cognitive-enhancing therapeutics.
Conventional approaches to modeling of E:I balance in SZ are limited in several ways, which may negatively
impact their ability to improve the assessment and treatment of cognitive deficits among those with SZ. The
following F31 NRSA proposal seeks to translate a recently-validated modeling approach, which does not
exhibit these limitations, to the study of E:I balance in SZ. Mesoscale Individualized Neurodynamic (MINDy)
modeling, which was created by members of this NRSA proposal team, is an approach for inferring the
biophysical parameters of an individual’s brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.
MINDy models provide a proxy-measure for E:I balance that is, unlike conventional computational models of
E:I balance in SZ, both statistically reliable (Test-Retest R > 0.7) and quick to compute for every region of
interest in the brain (~1min compute time). The following NRSA proposal leverages these advantages to
investigate disruptions in brain-wide E:I associated dynamics among those with SZ using a wide range of
clinically-relevant study designs. For aim one of this NRSA, we will use MINDy to investigate brain wide
disruptions to E:I-associated dynamics among individuals with SZ by using resting-state fMRI data from the
Human Connectome Project – Early Psychosis (HCP-EP) study. While conventional approaches have
demonstrated that SZ is primarily associated with disruptions to E:I balance in association cortical areas such
as the prefrontal cortex, there is some evidence that E:I balance may also be disrupted in sensory cortical
areas. This has not been explored with computational models of E:I balance. We hypothesize that MINDy will
uncover disruptions to E:I-associated dynamics in both association and sensory cortical areas among those
with SZ. For aim two of this NRSA, we will use MINDy to investigate genetic contributions to individual
differences in brain-wide E:I balance among a sample of approximately 900 monozygotic and dizygotic twin
pairs from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Twin (ABCD-Twin) study. While existing work
suggests that general changes in gene expression across the neocortex are related to differences in E:I
balance between cortical areas, aim two of this NRSA proposal will be the first study to investigate whether the
distribution of E:I balance across the brain is related to individual differences in heritable genetic factors. Lastly,
aim 3 of this NRSA proposal will combine MINDy with a computational model of decision-making, called the
drift-diffusion model, in order to investigate links between brain-wide E:I balance and the efficiency of evidence
accumulation during perceptual decision making. The contribution of E:I disruptions to cognitive deficits have
primarily only focused on the association cortex and also have only focused on working memory paradigms. In
order to address both of these gaps, this F31 NRSA proposal will use MINDy modeling to investigate
relationships between brain-wide E:I disruptions in SZ and perceptual decision making.","<Address><Adolescent><Adolescent Youth><Area><Autopsy><Biological><Biophysics><Body Tissues><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Clinical><Cognitive deficits><Computer Models><Computerized Models><Contour Perception><Data><Data Set><Decision Making><Diffusion><Disabling><Dizygotic Twins><Drugs><Encephalon><Environment><Equilibrium><FDA approved><Form Perception><Fraternal Twins><Functional MRI><Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging><Future><Gene Expression><Genetic><Genetic Diversity><Genetic Variation><Goals><Heritability><Identical Twins><Immediate Memory><Impairment><Individual><Individual Differences><Investigation><Link><Measures><Medication><Memory Deficit><Memory impairment><Modeling><Monozygotic twins><NRSA><National Research Service Awards><Neocortex><Neurosciences><Outcome Measure><Patients><Pattern><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Population><Prefrontal Cortex><Property><Proxy><Psychometrics><Psychoses><Randomized, Controlled Trials><Recurrence><Recurrent><Research Design><Rest><Rodent><Rodentia><Rodents Mammals><Sampling><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Sensory><Short-Term Memory><Shortterm Memory><Source><Study Type><Sum><Symptoms><Techniques><Testing><Theoretic Models><Theoretical model><Therapeutic><Time><Tissues><Training><Translating><Twin Studies><Work><association cortex><association cortical><association cortices><balance><balance function><biologic><biophysical characteristics><biophysical characterization><biophysical foundation><biophysical measurement><biophysical parameters><biophysical principles><biophysical properties><biophysical sciences><causal diagram><causal model><clinical relevance><clinically relevant><cognitive defects><cognitive development><cognitive enhancement><cognitive function><computational framework><computational modeling><computational models><computer based models><computer framework><computerized modeling><connectome><cost><dementia praecox><develop therapy><diffused><diffuses><diffusing><diffusions><drug/agent><early psychosis><economic cost><fMRI><generative models><homotypical cortex><human data><improved><innovate><innovation><innovative><interest><intervention development><isocortex><juvenile><juvenile human><measurable outcome><member><memory dysfunction><necropsy><neopallium><neural><neural imaging><neuro-imaging><neuroimaging><neurological imaging><neurophysiological><neurophysiology><non-human primate><nonhuman primate><novel><outcome measurement><postmortem><prevent><preventing><randomized control trial><schizophrenic><sensory cortex><study design><theories><therapy development><translational neuroscience><treatment development><working memory>",Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Schizophrenia; Serious Mental Illness
Induced neuronal cells: A novel tool to study neuropsychiatric diseases,Induced neuronal cells: A novel tool to study neuropsychiatric diseases,"Abstract
The goal of this project is to describe the function of synaptic adhesion molecules of the Neuroligin family
(Nlgns) in the mouse brain and in human neurons. Recent single cell expression studies have highlighted the
obversation that Nlgns are expressed also in non-neuronal cells, in particular oligodendrocyte precursors cells
(OPCs) and astrocytes who express Nlgns to even higher levels than neurons. Since little is known about the
function of Nlgns in glia and their effect on neurons and neural circuits, we propose to specifically delete Nlgns
in OPCs and astrocytes using our triple conditional Nlgn1-3 knock-out strain. Brains will be characterized
morphologically, electrophysiologically on the cellular and circuit level, and mutant mice will be characterized
by behavior. Next, we will perform an in-depth molecular characterization of the Neuroligin proteins by
characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying the surprising functional diversity of Nlgns. We will map
their functional domains in mouse neurons by expressing various domain-mutant proteins in Nlgn1-4 quadruple
knock-out cells. We will explore whether Nlgn sequence relates to functional specificity and investigate the
notion of a synaptic Neurexin “code” that may determine Nlgn specificity.
 To complement our mouse studies and explore human-specific Neuroligin function as well as human
disease-associated mutations, we will capitalize on our previous human stem cell and reprogramming work in
which we have developed human induced neuronal (iN) cells that exhibit all principal functional properties of
primary mouse neurons including robust synapse formation. We propose to utilize this system to investigate
the so far obscure function of NLGN4Y, a Y chromosomal gene closely related to NLGN4 on the X-
chromosome and a member of the family not present in mouse. We will assess subcellular targeting by tagging
the endogenous locus and assess the functional consequences of genetic deletion. Another frequently mutated
Nlgn gene is NLGN3. Unlike NLGN4 it is better conserved in mice, but almost nothing is known about its
function in human cells. In addition to generate loss-of-function alleles, we will study the functional
consequences of distinct ASD-associated mutations introduced into the human NLGN3 gene. We will use a
conditional mutagenesis approach as we have successfully done in the past, as it allows the generation of a
perfect control conidition derived from the identical cell line as the experimental condition. Mutant human
neurons and controls will be characterized biochemically, morphologically, by gene expression, and
electrophysiologically. Finally, we propose to investigate the role of the proposed Nlgns-modulators MDGAs
which are also found mutated in ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. We will assess their
requirement for proper synapse formation and function by generating loss-of-function alleles in human
neurons. We will further probe their function as Neuroligin modulators as competitive Nlgn binding molecules.",<ASD><Adhesion Molecule><Adhesions><Affinity><Alleles><Allelomorphs><Ammon Horn><Assay><Astrocytes><Astrocytus><Astroglia><Autism><Autistic Disorder><Behavior><Binding><Bioassay><Biochemical><Biological Assay><Biophysics><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cell Adhesion Molecule Gene><Cell Adhesion Molecules><Cell Body><Cell Line><CellLine><Cells><Co-culture><Cocultivation><Coculture><Coculture Techniques><Code><Coding System><Compensation><Complement><Complement Proteins><Complex><Cornu Ammonis><Cre driver><Cultured Cells><Disease><Disorder><Dysfunction><Early Infantile Autism><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Encephalon><Exhibits><Family><Family member><Foundations><Functional disorder><Funding><Gene Expression><Gene Family><Generations><Genes><Genetic><Genetic Alteration><Genetic Change><Genetic defect><Genetics-Mutagenesis><Glia><Glial Cells><Goals><Hippocampus><Human><Immune Precipitation><Immunoprecipitation><Induced Neurons><Infantile Autism><KO mice><Kanner's Syndrome><Knock-out><Knock-out Mice><Knockout><Knockout Mice><Kolliker's reticulum><Link><Maintenance><Maps><Mediating><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modern Man><Molecular><Molecular Interaction><Morphology><Murine><Mus><Mutagenesis><Mutagenesis Molecular Biology><Mutant Strains Mice><Mutate><Mutation><NKH-1><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules><Neural Transmission><Neurocyte><Neurodevelopmental Disorder><Neuroglia><Neuroglial Cells><Neurological Development Disorder><Neurons><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Non-neuronal cell><Nonneuronal cell><Null Mouse><Pattern><Phenotype><Physiopathology><Point Mutation><Preparation><Property><Proteins><Regulation><Role><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Specific qualifier value><Specificity><Specified><Strains Cell Lines><Synapses><Synaptic><Synaptic Transmission><System><Testing><Variant><Variation><Work><X Chromosome><Y Chromosome><astrocytic glia><autism spectral disorder><autism spectrum disorder><autistic spectrum disorder><behavior test><behavioral test><biophysical foundation><biophysical principles><biophysical sciences><cell adhesion protein><cell type><complementation><conditional mutant><conditional mutation><cultured cell line><dementia praecox><electrophysiological><experiment><experimental research><experimental study><experiments><family structure><gene function><genome mutation><hippocampal><human disease><human progenitor><human stem cells><iNeuron><insight><loss of function><male><mouse model><mouse mutant><murine model><mutant><nerve cement><neural circuit><neural circuitry><neurocircuitry><neurodevelopmental disease><neuronal><neuronal circuit><neuronal circuitry><neuropsychiatric disease><neuropsychiatric disorder><novel><oligodendrocyte precursor><oligodendrocyte progenitor><oligodendrocyte stem cell><pathophysiology><postsynaptic><precursor cell><preparations><presynaptic><schizophrenic><social role><sub-cellular targeting><subcellular targeting><synapse><synapse formation><synapse function><synaptic circuit><synaptic circuitry><synaptic function><synaptogenesis><tool>,Brain Disorders; Genetics; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - Human
"Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, placenta biology, and neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring","Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, placenta biology, and neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring","PROJECT SUMMARY
The extent to which SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy affects the biology of the maternal-placental-fetal triad
and neurodevelopmental trajectory in offspring is not known. Early studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can induce
alterations in the placenta which can increase risk for adverse perinatal outcomes and, based on knowledge
from other infectious and inflammatory disorders in pregnancy and preliminary data on the current pandemic,
increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in offspring. The long-term goal of this proposal is to
timely identify the impact of the ongoing pandemic on the neurodevelopment of infants born following maternal
SARS-CoV-2 infection. The objective is to analyze the relationships between maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection,
placenta biology, and neurodevelopmental outcomes, in interaction with genomic risk (GRSs) for NDDs and sex.
The central hypothesis is that maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection and infection-related pregnancy complications
affect early paths of brain development, particularly in those with high GRSs for NDDs and in males, and that
these effects are mediated by alterations in placenta morphology and molecular biology. The rationale underlying
the proposal is that completion will define critical targets for identification and potentially prevention of NDDs in
the offspring of infected mothers. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims:
1) Determine pregnancy, placental, and newborn outcomes following antenatal SARS-CoV-2 infection; 2)
Investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 maternal infection, GRSs for NDDs, and placenta molecular
biology; 3) Evaluate the relationship between maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, offspring genomic
risk factors for NDDs, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. We will pursue the aims using an innovative
combination of placenta tissue and maternal and fetal blood analysis, and comprehensive psychometric testing
of early child neurodevelopment. We will compare woman-placenta-infant triads exposed to SARS-CoV-2
infection during pregnancy to unvaccinated and vaccinated controls. We will study how, in a large sample of
multiple ethnicities, maternal infection and stress, GRSs for NDDs, and sex, adversely affect
neurodevelopmental outcomes of the offspring though processes mediated by alteration in placenta gene/protein
expression and maternal immune activation. The proposed research is significant, because it will characterize
the relationship between maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection and neurodevelopmental outcome of the offspring, and
also identify factors, molecules and genomic predictors that modulate, mediate or – as biomarkers – reveal such
relationship. The proximate expected outcome of this work will be an understanding of the mechanisms through
which maternal infection, genomic risk and sex, placenta biology, and postnatal factors may contribute to define
risk for NDDs. The results will have an immediate positive impact to inform targeted interventions and guidelines
for SARS-CoV-2 exposed women and their infants, impacting how clinicians evaluate and care for these cases,
and to identify potential biomarkers of risk for NDDs in offspring of mothers with infection during pregnancy.",<0-11 years old><0-4 weeks old><1st trimester><2019 novel corona virus><2019 novel

Quantitative analysis of metabotropic glutamate receptor activation and modulation,Quantitative analysis of metabotropic glutamate receptor activation and modulation,"Project Summary
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of membrane receptors in human and have emerged
as the largest family of drug targets with more than 35% of all drugs on the market functioning through GPCRs.
Despite their desirability, to date, many GPCR families remain undrugged, partly due to lack of mechanistic
knowledge about their activation and modulation. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are members of
class C GPCRs and are critical modulators of glutamate signaling. Due to their widespread expression in tissue
and their central role they are among the most promising drug targets for the neurological disorders such as
fragile X syndrome, epilepsy, anxiety, schizophrenia as well as some cancers. Advances in protein engineering
and functional, structural and computational methods in the past twenty years have provided insights into the
architecture, signaling and expression patterns of mGluRs. However, a general model of how ligands change
the shape of mGluRs and how this conformational change is relayed across the membrane and over 12 nm to
activate specific signaling pathways is poorly understood. In this research we will develop a novel technology
that will allow us to watch a single mGluR protein while functioning in physiological conditions, in real time. This
will allow us to quantify the motions of different domains of the receptor that are involved in signaling. Next, we
will employ this approach to study how cholesterol and synthetic modulators of mGluR signaling affect protein
conformation and dynamics to affect receptor signaling. This is a multi-disciplinary proposal where state-of-the-
art in vitro single-molecule FRET (smFRET) spectroscopy is complemented by live-cell imaging, protein
engineering and biophysical and biochemical methods. Once accomplished, the proposed research could
provide a critical step towards rational design of efficient drugs with fewer undesirable side effects. Furthermore,
these studies will provide a general roadmap for quantitative high-resolution structure-function studies of
mammalian membrane proteins.",<ASD><Affect><Anxiety><Architecture><Autism><Autistic Disorder><Biochemical><Biophysics><Body Tissues><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cancers><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Signaling><Cholesterol><Computing Methodologies><Development><Drug Targeting><Drugs><Early Infantile Autism><Encephalon><Engineering / Architecture><Epilepsy><Epileptic Seizures><Epileptics><Escalante syndrome><Family><Fragile X><Fragile X Syndrome><G Protein-Complex Receptor><G Protein-Coupled Receptor Genes><G-Protein-Coupled Receptors><GPCR><Human><In Vitro><Infantile Autism><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Kanner's Syndrome><Knowledge><Learning><Ligands><Malignant Neoplasms><Malignant Tumor><Marketing><Martin-Bell Syndrome><Martin-Bell-Renpenning syndrome><Medication><Membrane><Membrane Protein Gene><Membrane Proteins><Membrane-Associated Proteins><Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors><Methodology><Methods><Modeling><Modern Man><Molecular Configuration><Molecular Conformation><Molecular Stereochemistry><Motion><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neurologic Disorders><Neurological Disorders><Paralysis Agitans><Parkinson><Parkinson Disease><Pattern><Pharmaceutical Preparations><Physiologic><Physiological><Primary Parkinsonism><Protein Conformation><Protein Dynamics><Protein Engineering><Receptor Activation><Receptor Protein><Receptor Signaling><Renpenning syndrome 2><Research><Resolution><Role><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Seizure Disorder><Shapes><Signal Pathway><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Spectroscopy><Spectrum Analyses><Spectrum Analysis><Structure><Surface Proteins><Time><Tissues><X-linked mental deficiency-megalotestes syndrome><X-linked mental retardation with fragile X syndrome><X-linked mental retardation-fragile site 1 syndrome><addiction><addictive disorder><autism spectral disorder><autism spectrum disorder><autism-fragile X (AFRAX) syndrome><autistic spectrum disorder><biological signal transduction><biophysical foundation><biophysical principles><biophysical sciences><computational methodology><computational methods><computer based method><computer methods><computing method><conformation><conformational><conformational state><conformationally><conformations><dementia praecox><developmental><drug/agent><epilepsia><epileptogenic><fra(X) syndrome><fra(X)(28) syndrome><fra(X)(q27) syndrome><fra(X)(q27-28) syndrome><fragile X-mental retardation syndrome><fragile Xq syndrome><fragile site mental retardation 1><genetic protein engineering><glutamate signaling><glutamatergic dendrodendritic synapses><glutamatergic signaling><human disease><insight><live cell image><live cell imaging><live cellular image><live cellular imaging><macro-orchidism-marker X (MOMX) syndrome><macro-orchidism-marker X syndrome><malignancy><mar(X) syndrome><marker X syndrome><member><membrane structure><mental retardation-macroorchidism syndrome><multidisciplinary><neoplasm/cancer><neurological disease><new technology><novel technologies><protein design><rational design><receptor><resolutions><schizophrenic><side effect><single-molecule FRET><single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer><smFRET><social role><therapeutically effective>,Bioengineering; Brain Disorders; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Schizophrenia
Functional ontogeny of pair bonding neural circuits,Functional ontogeny of pair bonding neural circuits,"Project summary/Abstract
The rewarding bonds we forge in adulthood, in particular our pair bonds with romantic partners, have innumerable
protective effects on our brains and behaviors. Individuals with difficulties in social engagement and competence, such
as those suffering from social anxiety, major depression, ADHD, or Autism Spectrum Disorder, are particularly
susceptible to the health risks of social isolation and impoverished social networks. Aberrant activity of dopaminergic
reward systems during adolescence coincides with the onset of many of these disorders, suggesting that developmental
abnormalities in the neural substrates that promote social reward underlies disease pathology. Critically, most of what
we know about the neural mechanisms that facilitate pair bonding come from the study of adult brains, highlighting a
dire need to investigate the functional development of social bonding circuits to design better therapeutic treatments
for social dysfunctions. The current proposal aims to leverage the socially monogamous prairie vole system to
investigate the maturational changes in dopaminergic reward circuitry that initiate the capacity for pair bonding in
adulthood. Prairie voles form strong pair bonds with their mates, which relies on the functional activity of dopamine
systems. In Aim 1, I will use fiber photometry to ask how developmental age and sex mediates socially induced changes
in in vivo dopaminergic neural activity. In Aim 2, I will use chemogenetic approaches to investigate how perturbing
dopamine circuits during sensitive developmental periods impacts adult pair bonding phenotypes. Finally, in Aim 3 I will
investigate the developmental changes in transcriptional signatures of same‐sex and opposite‐sex social interactions as
prairie voles mature and become capable of dopamine‐dependent pair bonding. Altogether, these efforts will determine
how social experiences across developmental time scaffold the maturation of pair bonding dopamine circuits. These
findings will profer novel insights into the molecular and cellular processes that may be disrupted in neuropsychiatric
illnesses involving impaired bonding behaviors, which cannot be investigated in traditional non‐bonding rodent models.",<12-20 years old><21+ years

The Influence of the Pretectum on the Pulvinar Nucleus,The Influence of the Pretectum on the Pulvinar Nucleus,"Project Summary
To accurately code and react to the visual environment, signals from the retina must integrate with the spatial
and temporal aspects of eye and body movements. Projections from the pretectum (PT) to the pulvinar
nucleus (PUL) may serve in modifying visual signals in the context of eye and/or body movements. However,
the specific role of the PT in active vision has not been tested using precise circuity manipulation methods. In
the mouse, projections from the PT innervate rostral regions of the PUL that are reciprocally connected to
the primary visual cortex (V1). However, little is currently known regarding PT and rostral PUL circuits, or
how manipulation of the PT modifies rostral PUL activity. I propose to address these gaps in knowledge via
the following specific aims. Aim 1) Determine the ultrastructure, synaptic properties, and convergence
patterns of layer 5 V1 and PT inputs to rostral PUL neurons using viral tracing, electron microscopy, in vitro
recording, and optogenetics. Aim 2) Characterize the morphology and response properties of retinal ganglion
cells that innervate PT-PUL neurons using combinations of herpes simplex virus retrograde tracing,
monosynaptic rabies virus tracing, and in vitro two-photon fluorescence imaging of calcium signals. Aim 3)
Determine the response properties of PT neurons and how they affect the visual response properties of
rostral PUL neurons by combining in vivo recordings from the PT and PUL of awake head-fixed mice with
optogenetic inhibition of PT neurons. The goal of this project is to test the overarching hypothesis that the PT
modulates PUL visual signals in the context of animal movement.","<2-photon><Address><Affect><Amblyopia><Animals><Axon Terminals><Brain><Brain Nervous System><CRE Recombinase><Calcium Ion Signaling><Calcium Signaling><Cats><Cats Mammals><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Nucleus><Cell Signaling><Cells><Code><Coding System><Darkness><Dendrites><Diagnosis><Disease><Disorder><Domestic Cats><Dyslexia><Electron Microscopy><Encephalon><Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase><Environment><Exhibits><Eye Motility Disorders><Eye Movement Disorders><Eye Movements><Feline Species><Felis catus><Felis domestica><Felis domesticus><Felis sylvestris catus><Fiber Optics><Fluorescence><Frequencies><Glutamates><Goals><HSV><Head><Herpes Simplex Virus><Herpes labialis Virus><Image><In Vitro><Individual><Injections><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Knowledge><L-Glutamate><Laser Electromagnetic><Laser Radiation><Lasers><Light><Link><Medical><Methods><Mice><Mice Mammals><Modeling><Morphology><Motion><Movement><Murine><Mus><Nasal><Nasal Passages Nose><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neurons><Nose><Nucleus><Ocular Motility Disorders><Opsin><Parvalbumins><Pathologic Nystagmus><Pathway interactions><Pattern><Phorias><Photic Stimulation><Photoradiation><Physiologic pulse><Plasma Retinol-Binding Protein><Presynaptic Nerve Endings><Presynaptic Terminals><Primary visual cortex><Probability><Property><Protocol><Protocols documentation><Pulse><Pulvinar><Pulvinar structure><RBP4><RBP4 gene><Rabies mapping><Rabies trans synaptic tracing><Rabies virus mediated mapping><Reaction><Reflex><Reflex action><Reporter><Research><Respiratory System, Nose, Nasal Passages><Retina><Retinal Ganglion Cells><Retinol-Binding Protein 4><Rod-Opsin><Role><Running><Saccades><Saccadic Eye Movements><Saccadic Pursuit><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Shapes><Sight><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Simplexvirus><Source><Speed><Squint><Stimulus><Strabismus><Striate Cortex><Striate area><Structure><Synapses><Synaptic><Synaptic Boutons><Synaptic Terminals><Testing><Thalamic structure><Thalamus><Viral><Virus><Vision><Visual><Visual Fields><Visual Motion><Visual Stimulation><Whole-Cell Recordings><Word Blindness><active vision><area striata><awake><bacteriophage P1 recombinase Cre><biological signal transduction><body movement><cell type><dementia praecox><eye field><eye tracking><fluorescence imaging><fluorescent imaging><gaze><glutamatergic><imaging><in vivo><insight><neuronal><nystagmus><optogenetics><pathway><preference><pulvinar thalami><rabies based mapping><rabies based retrograde mapping><rabies circuit tracing><rabies mediated retrograde monosynaptic tracing><rabies retrograde tracing><rabies tracer><rabies tracing><rabies viral tracing><rabies virus mediated circuit mapping><rabies virus monosynaptic circuit tracing><rabies virus monosynaptic tracing><rabies virus retrograde tracing><rabies virus tracing><response><retinal ganglion><schizophrenic><social role><synapse><thalamic><tool><tracing with rabies><two-photon><visual function><visual stimulus><visual tracking>",Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurosciences
Role of cortical connections to higher-order thalamic nuclei in visual decision-making,Role of cortical connections to higher-order thalamic nuclei in visual decision-making,"PROJECT SUMMARY
To guide decisions, visual information must flow from primary visual cortex (V1) to prefrontal cortex (PFC), via
multiple, parallel cortico-cortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical connections. Both V1 and PFC have direct
connections with the pulvinar, a higher-order nucleus of the thalamus, but the role of this nucleus in sensory
processing is still largely mysterious. Importantly, much of the pulvinar has no homologue in rodents or
carnivores, which makes studying it in nonhuman primates all the more important. This goal of this project is to
uncover how direct connections between the cortex (V1 and PFC) and the pulvinar interact and impact visual
perception and visually-guided decisions in non-human primates. To achieve this goal, the project proposes a
novel method, using focused ultrasound to non-invasively open the blood brain barrier, in order to precisely
target cortico-thalamic projections for causal, optogenetic manipulations. Current evidence points to a critical
role for the pulvinar in redirecting visual attention, but its role in visually-guided decision-making and perception
is less clear. To directly test how these cortico-thalamic projections affect visual perception and decision-making,
these circuits will be optogenetically activated while monkeys perform challenging psychophysical tasks. We will
then be able to assess the contribution of individual, cell-type specific, components of these circuits, by
measuring changes in behavioral performance and differences in neural responses across multiple brain areas.
The proposed projects builds on my experience implementing multi-area electrophysiological recordings and
optogenetic manipulations in awake, behaving primates. The training phase will allow me to develop novel
approaches for transfecting larges areas with optogenetic constructs and practice targeting deep thalamic
structures in the primate brain electrophysiologically. The long-term goal for my research program is to resolve
the essential neural circuit that sensory information must pass through in order to become available for
perceptually-based decisions. The central hypothesis for this is work is that cortical-thalamic loops are necessary
for the subjective experience of sensory inputs, and a fundamental feature of perceptual decision-making. My
goal is to apply this circuit-level knowledge of perceptual representations to improve brain function in the disease
state or following damage to sensory organs, but also to use this knowledge to improve how we can effectively
communicate information to healthy brains.",<AD/HD><ADHD><Address><Affect><American><Anatomic Sites><Anatomic structures><Anatomy><Animals><Area><Attention><Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder><Automobile Driving><Behavior><Behavioral><Blood - brain barrier anatomy><Blood-Brain Barrier><Brain><Brain Nervous System><Cell Body><Cell Communication and Signaling><Cell Nucleus><Cell Signaling><Cells><Cognition><Cognitive><Communication><Complex><Decision Making><Detection><Development><Devices><Diffuse><Disease><Disorder><Distal><Electrophysiology><Electrophysiology (science)><Encephalon><Engineering><Focused Ultrasound><GeneHomolog><Genes><Goals><Health><Hemato-Encephalic Barrier><Homolog><Homologous Gene><Homologue><Human><Individual><Intracellular Communication and Signaling><Knowledge><Lateral><Learning><Lesion><Macaca><Macaque><Measures><Medial><Methodology><Methods><Modern Man><Monkeys><Neocortex><Nerve Cells><Nerve Unit><Nervous System Diseases><Nervous System Disorder><Neural Cell><Neurocyte><Neurologic Disorders><Neurological Disorders><Neurons><Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology><Nucleus><Opsin><Organ><Perception><Performance><Phase><Population><Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder><Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder><Prefrontal Cortex><Primary visual cortex><Primates><Primates Mammals><Psychophysics><Pulvinar><Pulvinar structure><Reporting><Research><Rod-Opsin><Rodent><Rodentia><Rodents Mammals><Role><Schizophrenia><Schizophrenic Disorders><Sensory><Sight><Signal Transduction><Signal Transduction Systems><Signaling><Stimulus><Striate Cortex><Striate area><Structure><Techniques><Technology><Testing><Thalamic Nuclei><Thalamic structure><Thalamus><Training><Transfection><Viral><Virus><Vision><Visual><Visual Perception><Visual attention><Work><area striata><awake><biological signal transduction><bloodbrain barrier><cell type><dementia praecox><developmental><driving><electrophysiological><executive control><executive function><experience><homotypical cortex><improved><in vivo><isocortex><neopallium><neural><neural circuit><neural circuitry><neuro-prosthetic><neurocircuitry><neurological disease><neuronal><neurophysiological><neurophysiology><neuroprosthesis><neuroprosthetic><new approaches><non-human primate><nonhuman primate><novel><novel approaches><novel strategies><novel strategy><optogenetics><programs><psychophysical><pulvinar thalami><response><schizophrenic><sensory input><social role><synaptic circuit><synaptic circuitry><thalamic><visual function><visual information><visual process><visual processing>,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurosciences
