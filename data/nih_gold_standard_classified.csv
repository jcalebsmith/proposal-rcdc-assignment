Elucidating novel molecular mechanisms of irisin-mediated effects via integrin,Elucidating novel molecular mechanisms of irisin-mediated effects via integrin,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Exercise benefits the body in many ways. The functions of skeletal muscle, brain, liver, bone, adipose tissue
and heart all gain from various types of physical activity and training. People suffering from disabilities, morbid
obesity, or age-related diseases, are usually physically inactive, which exacerbates their symptoms and leads to
development of other types of diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and some
forms of cancers. Scientific explorations of exercise have become more molecular, focusing on the pathways
and molecules that mediate these benefits. Irisin has been identified as an exercise-induced hormone that
embodies many adaptations to exercise in a variety of tissues/organs, including “browning” of subcutaneous
adipose tissue, bone remodeling, improving cognitive deficits and neuropathology, and promoting myogenesis
of skeletal muscles.
In bone and fat, the effects of irisin are mediated via αv integrins, with αvβ5 identified as the major receptor.
However, my biochemical and biophysical characterization of direct interaction between irisin and αvβ5
suggested extremely weak binding, while the concentrations of irisin that induce detectable amount of
irisin-mediated effects in the body and in the cultured cells are really low, indicating a very high irisin/receptor
binding affinity. This paradox could be explained by the existence of an additional factor that facilitates
irisin/integrin interaction and irisin-mediated integrin activation. My preliminary data suggested that an
exercise-induced circulating protein Hsp90α binds to integrin αvβ5, and functions as a cofactor to mediate the
binding of irisin to integrin and irisin-induced integrin signaling. Irisin is different from many integrin ligands in
that irisin is small, heavily glycosylated, and lacks the well-identified integrin binding motif, indicating a
non-canonical ways of ligand binding to integrins.
Biophysical and biochemical approaches will be used to characterize the complexes formed by irisin (WT and
glycosylation mutants), αvβ5 and Hsp90α. The molecular model will be firstly tested in HEK293T cells
ectopically expressing αv and β5, and muscle and fat cells, using molecular approaches and fluorescence
microscopy. The effects of Hsp90α will be further evaluated in mice. Taken together, these studies will advance
our understanding of irisin-mediated (or hormone-mediated, in general) integrin signaling, which will assist drug
and antibody development to treat patients with obesity, aged-related diseases and neuro- or muscular
degenerative disorders.
The proposed project represents a great balance between biochemistry/biophysics as well as cell biology, in
which I was trained during my Ph.D, and cell metabolism and animal physiology, which are the primary
technologies employed by the Spiegelman lab. The resources provided by Bruce’s networks, DFCI and HMS,
tremendously facilitated my research, and will support me to become an independent scientist.",,Biotechnology; Obesity; Physical Activity; Prevention,Osteoporosis,0.9118693470954895,Osteoporosis:0.911869; Diabetes:0.911737; Sarcopenia:0.911238
Pyroptotic Macrophages Traps Against Shigella Infection,Pyroptotic Macrophages Traps Against Shigella Infection,"Shigella spp. are major enteric pathogens, causing acute diarrhea and bacillary dysentery leading to severe mortality and morbidity worldwide. Yet, there is no licensed vaccine to prevent shigellosis. Shigella virulence requires a T3SS and at least 30 secreted effectors that are often functionally redundant, yet required to invade host cells, maintain a replicative niche, minimize alarm signals, and promote colonization. We previously showed that S. flexneri T3SS activity is detected in macrophages by Caspase-1 inflammasomes, resulting in pyroptosis. In the recent mouse shigellosis model, the role of the inflammasome is only focused on gut intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). However, it is generally believed that Shigella initially infect macrophages and takes advantage of pyroptotic cell death to exit the cells and subsequently infect IECs. On the other hand, macrophage pyroptosis is known to generate pore-induced traps (PITs), trapping, and neutralizing intracellular bacterial pathogens. Since macrophages pyroptosis is considered to play dichotomous roles during Shigella infection, we propose to investigate the interaction between macrophages' inflammasomes and S. flexneri. We propose two specific Aims: In Aim1, we will investigate how pyroptotic macrophages from PITs trap intracellular bacteria. In Aim 2. We will define the role of pyroptotic macrophages and PITs during S. flexneri infection in vitro and in vivo. We hope that examining the role of macrophages pyroptosis against S. flexneri infection, will be highly significant and relevant for better understanding immunity and disease pathologies during Shigella infection and thereby providing the basis for developing novel safer, and more effective vaccines.",,Biodefense and Related Countermeasures; Digestive Diseases; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Foodborne Illness; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Vaccine Related,Vector-Borne Diseases,0.9121432304382324,Vector-Borne Diseases:0.912143; Sepsis:0.909329; Malaria:0.909298

Studies show that
environmental exposures contribute to an increased susceptibility to PTB. Identification of the causative
etiology of PTB is essential to improving global maternal and child health. Our preliminary data reveal that
exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is associated with PTB. We have reported that proximity
to Superfund sites in Harris County is associated with very low birth weight, and our studies reveal higher
levels of PAHs in placentas from PTBs compared to term births specifically in women residing near Superfund
sites. In this proposal we will delve into the molecular underpinnings behind PTB and the specific
environmental exposures of PAHs through use of our established transcriptomic and epigenomic pipelines. We
will leverage our readily available serum and placental samples from a population based and PTB enriched
cohort. Furthermore, geostatistical modeling will be utilized to identify clusters of PTB throughout Harris
County. Our central hypothesis underlying our research is that PAH exposures are associated with an
increased rate of PTB, that transcriptomics and epigenomics will yield readily translatable mechanistic
information on this association, and geostatistical modeling will reveal increased clusters of PTB in proximity to
Superfund sites in Harris County.",,"Clinical Research; Contraception/Reproduction; Endocrine Disruptors; Genetics; Human Genome; Lung; Maternal Health; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Pregnancy; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn; Prevention; Women's Health Research","Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn",0.9105510711669922,"Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn:0.910551; Rare Diseases:0.907489; Conditions Affecting the Embryonic and Fetal Periods:0.907488"

Mobile Three-Dimensional Screening for Cranial Malformations,Mobile Three-Dimensional Screening for Cranial Malformations,"ABSTRACT
 Delayed identification of infant head malformation is causing unnecessary medical complications and societal
costs. A critical challenge in the early detection is the absence of tools available to pediatric offices to perform
quantitative head shape assessment during well-child visits. Delays in diagnosis limit the opportunity for early,
less invasive and effective treatment options. In this Fast-track SBIR project, PediaMetrix Inc. has joined forces
with pediatric hospitals and providers to develop and evaluate SoftSpotTM, which is the first mobile digital tool for
3D data collection and analysis of infant cranial malformations at the point-of-care.
 Head malformations during infancy can be synostotic (i.e., craniosynostosis) or nonsynostotic (such as
deformational plagiocephaly and brachycephaly or DPB). Both types of conditions require immediate attention
and benefit from early treatment to avoid long-term health complications. The prevalence of DPB increased
dramatically in recent years, from 5% to approximately 20%-30%, causing the condition to be called a pediatric
epidemic. Craniosynostosis is less common affecting 1 in 2,000 children. To improve the early management of
these conditions and to prevent more complex treatment and associated morbidities, it is essential to monitor
the growth of the infant head at the point-of-care.
 To address this unmet clinical need, we will develop and evaluate a mobile digital tool that will enable
pediatricians to capture and analyze 3D scans of every infant for the early diagnosis and management of cranial
malformations. In the Phase I of this project, we will develop a novel technology to rapidly capture and analyze
3D data of the top of cranium in just seconds. We will use machine learning methods to automatically compute
the head shape parameters, including the head circumference which is routinely performed during every child
visit, but currently with an outdated and unreliable measuring tape. Our technology will be designed for the
general cranial evaluation of all infants during well-child visits. In Phase II, we will develop methods for the 3D
reconstruction and analysis of the full cranium from a smartphone. We will also train deep learning models to
classify types of craniosynostosis and other cranial conditions and conduct clinical evaluation and user-feasibility
studies.
 The overall mission of PediaMetrix is to provide accurate decision support tools for pediatric health at the
point-of-care. This will be achieved through machine learning and quantitative imaging algorithms that in
combination with smartphone technological advances will be packaged as mobile digital health solutions
accessible to pediatric health providers at any time and location. Successful demonstration of SoftSpot3DTM will
lead to a significant reduction of the number of children left with untreated cranial conditions in addition to
lowering the associated healthcare costs and social anxiety.",,"Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Congenital Structural Anomalies; Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Disease; Health Services; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Pediatric; Prevention; Primary Health Care; Rare Diseases; Telehealth",Pediatric,0.9315162897109985,Pediatric:0.931516; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD):0.926888; Rare Diseases:0.924411

Fatal Overdose Review Teams - Research to Enhance Surveillance Systems (FORTRESS),Fatal Overdose Review Teams - Research to Enhance Surveillance Systems (FORTRESS),"This study is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions for the overdose epidemic, including opioid and stimulant use disorders. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to address the national opioid public health crisis and improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction.
This project seeks to address the overdose epidemic by working with overdose fatality review (OFR) teams. Current OFR practices rely on the case review model to make policy and programmatic recommendations. However, the continued rise in overdose rates and sheer number of preventable overdose deaths suggest a need to shift OFR teams away from case review and toward using timely population-level data to better inform their recommendations and actions. The goal of our proposed project, Fatal Overdose Review Teams – Research to Enhance Surveillance Systems (FORTRESS), is to improve standard OFR practices by equipping OFRs with a data dashboard built on real-time aggregate data, record-linked across multiple sources and presented in a way that helps identify and visualize common “overdose touchpoints,” or opportunities to deliver harm-reduction services or engage individuals at risk for overdose in evidence-based treatment. Aligning with the goals of the HEAL Data2Action Program, the FORTRESS research team will leverage available resources and expertise to help OFRs translate data to action. During the R61 Phase, the research team will strengthen established cross-sector partnerships with two state agencies, the Indiana Department of Health and the Indiana Management Performance Hub (MPH), which provide the necessary statewide data infrastructure to record-link population-level administrative data from multiple sources. MPH has also successfully developed publicly accessible data dashboards. The FORTRESS team will build on the early successes of MPH to ensure more timely collection of overdose event data and design the “Overdose Touchpoints Dashboard” (Aim 1). Our team will train OFR team members in Data-Driven Decision Making (DDDM) to effectively use the dashboard. The FORTRESS team also includes individuals involved in developing the CDC’s OFR best practice guidelines and a pilot study of OFR adherence to these guidelines, which will inform our team’s development of an “OFR Fidelity Tool” (Aim 2). This tool will be the first of its kind. For the R33 phase, we will conduct a cluster-randomized stepped-wedge trial comparing the impact of our intervention (dashboard + DDDM training) versus standard OFR practices on both implementation (Aim 3) and effectiveness outcomes (Aim 4). Implementation outcomes include implementation
process fidelity (Stages of Implementation Completion), staff acceptance of harm reduction philosophies (qualitative interviews), OFR fidelity to CDC best practices (FORTRESS OFR Fidelity Tool), and usability of the Overdose Touchpoint Dashboard, (Systems Usability Scale). A statewide OFR data repository serves as a rich source of data on effectiveness outcomes, including OFR team recommendation quality and local actions to implement recommended overdose prevention strategies. We will also survey OFR team members to assess changes in their attitudes toward evidence-based overdose prevention strategies. In sum, the FORTRESS team is uniquely qualified to help OFRs use more comprehensive, available data to inform quality, action-oriented recommendations to reduce overdose.",,Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Dissemination and Implementation Research; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Harm Reduction for Substance Misuse; Opioid Misuse and Addiction; Opioids; Physical Injury - Accidents and Adverse Effects; Prevention; Substance Misuse; Substance Misuse Prevention,Recovery Support Services,0.9232546091079712,Recovery Support Services:0.923255; Harm Reduction for Substance Misuse:0.921019; Prevention:0.918132
Improving End-of-Life Care for Hospitalized Patients with Lewy Body Disorders,Improving End-of-Life Care for Hospitalized Patients with Lewy Body Disorders,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lewy body disorders, a subset of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRDs), are the second most
common neurodegenerative disorders worldwide and the 14th leading cause of death in the United States.
Lewy body ADRDs are progressive, incurable, and mortality rates are rising, making end-of-life (EoL) care a
significant public health concern. The majority of persons with Lewy body ADRDs are hospitalized in their last
6 months of life with high rates of intensive care unit admission, in-hospital death, and low rates of discharge to
hospice care. Because these markers of poor care quality are often incongruent with patient care preferences,
urgent interventions are needed to improve EoL care quality in acute care hospitals. Despite this critical need,
there are two fundamental knowledge gaps in developing inpatient EoL interventions for persons with Lewy
body ADRDs: 1) lack of a prognostic model to determine risk of 6-month mortality and 2) lack of a validated
tool to measure EoL care quality. This proposal requests support for a mentored career development award for
Dr. Whitley Aamodt, a movement disorders specialist, neurodegenerative neurologist, and clinical researcher
at the University of Pennsylvania. The overarching goal of this project is to improve prognostication and EoL
care quality for hospitalized persons with Lewy body ADRDs by identifying patients at the greatest risk of death
and ensuring that hospital-based care is appropriate and aligned with care preferences. In Aim 1, Dr. Aamodt
will use comprehensive Medicare data to develop a risk-prediction model for 6-month all-cause mortality in a
nationally representative sample of hospitalized patients with Lewy body ADRDs using advanced predictive
modeling. This model will be externally validated in a second cohort of Medicare beneficiaries from the post-
pandemic period. In Aim 2, Dr. Aamodt will create, test, and externally validate a patient-centered EoL care
quality instrument based on data gathered from diverse Lewy body ADRD patients, care partners, and
practitioners using qualitative research methods and factor analysis. In executing these aims, Dr. Aamodt will
obtain additional training in neuroepidemiology, biostatistics, and qualitative research under the guidance of
mentors and advisors in epidemiologic research methods (John Farrar, MD, PhD), neurodegenerative disease
epidemiology and health services research (Allison Willis, MD, MS), predictive modeling (Warren Bilker, PhD),
qualitative research methods (Katharine Rendle, PhD, MPH), and palliative care research (Scott Halpern, MD,
PhD). The results of this project will provide fundamental knowledge about hospitalized patients with Lewy
body ADRDs nearing EoL and will guide the development of future interventions to improve EoL care quality.
This work aligns with the strategic goal of the National Institute on Aging to address EoL care needs in ADRDs.
Through the research training and mentorship gained during this career development award, Dr. Aamodt will
establish herself as an independent investigator in the field of applied epidemiology, outcomes research, and
palliative and EoL care for aging Americans with neurodegenerative diseases.",,Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD); Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Dementia; Health Services; Lewy Body Dementia; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Palliative Care; Patient Safety,Lewy Body Dementia,0.9608004689216614,Lewy Body Dementia:0.960800; Neurodegenerative:0.946050; Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD):0.943409
The Lombard effect in muscle tension dysphonia: mechanistic and clinical characterization,The Lombard effect in muscle tension dysphonia: mechanistic and clinical characterization,"Project Summary
The objective of this project is to investigate voice changes associated with speaking in challenging acoustic
environments to better inform clinical care for individuals with voice disorders. Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD)
is a common voice disorder that often results in difficulty communicating in daily life. Many people experience
voice symptoms from speaking in noisy environments; for most, the symptoms resolve quickly. However, for
those with MTD, voice symptoms often persist, making it difficult for them to meet their occupational and social
vocal demands. The reasons for this persistence are unknown. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate the
underlying mechanisms of voice production in noisy environments to optimize and individualize voice
assessment and treatment for these individuals with MTD. Most speakers increase their vocal intensity while
speaking in noisy environments, a phenomenon known as the Lombard effect. Speaking during and after
exposure to a loud environment presumably requires monitoring of both background noise and one’s own voice,
and then responding with vocal motor adjustments. This implies that sensorimotor integration is crucial in these
real-life circumstances. There is preliminary evidence that individuals with MTD have atypical auditory-motor
integration and an atypical persistence of Lombard responses after speaking in noise. However, no known
studies have comprehensively characterized the underlying mechanisms and clinically relevant voice changes
of the Lombard effect for those with and without MTD. To develop evidenced-based diagnostics and targeted
voice treatments, we must better understand the processes and voice changes associated with speaking in daily
life. Therefore, the specific aims of this project are to 1) investigate the sensorimotor mechanisms of the Lombard
effect and 2) characterize clinically relevant voice changes associated with the Lombard effect for individuals
with and without MTD within a communicative context. Sixty speakers (30 with MTD and 30 without) will complete
a Lombard task to measure vocal responses and self-reported vocal effort while communicating during and after
exposure to a noisy environment. Inexperienced listeners will rate overall severity of dysphonia for the speakers’
speech samples from the Lombard task. Lombard responses will be analyzed behaviorally and neuro-
computationally, and they will be compared between the groups and across various stages of the Lombard task.
Clinically relevant vocal measures (i.e., acoustic, self-reported vocal effort, and listener-auditory perceptual
ratings of overall severity of dysphonia) of the Lombard task will be compared across groups and phases of the
experimental task. This project is theoretically and clinically significant; it will fill in a substantial gap, providing
theoretical insight into the sensorimotor mechanisms of MTD in real-life environmental contexts, and contributing
to the clinical evidence to improve diagnostics and individualize treatment for those with sensorimotor deficits
underlying their voice disorders.",,Clinical Research; Neurosciences,Temporomandibular Muscle/Joint Disorder (TMJD),0.9405994415283203,Temporomandibular Muscle/Joint Disorder (TMJD):0.940599; Myasthenia Gravis:0.926410; Dystonia:0.924574
Optimizing pain-related outcomes following orthopedic trauma: testing novel risk factors and determining the feasibility of a new pain psychology intervention,Optimizing pain-related outcomes following orthopedic trauma: testing novel risk factors and determining the feasibility of a new pain psychology intervention,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The long-term goal of this K23 Career Development Award is to prepare the PI (Rachel Aaron, PhD) for
an independent research career that aims to promote adaptive recovery for individuals who survive orthopedic
trauma. Orthopedic trauma, resulting in severe injuries such as multiple fractures or amputation, occurs in
around 3 million people annually in the United States; about half of survivors experience persistent pain and
psychological distress in the year following injury, and most report substantial disability 7 years post trauma.
There is an urgent need to identify factors that underlie pain and psychological distress following orthopedic
trauma and to develop targeted psychological interventions to treat these potentially disabling symptoms.
 The broader literature suggests that difficulties with emotion regulation (i.e., identifying one's emotions
and engaging in strategies to up- or down-regulate them) and central sensitization (i.e., alterations in the
endogenous modulation of pain) lead to poor pain-related outcomes. Using a theory-driven assessment of
emotion regulation, and gold-standard, laboratory-based assessment of central sensitization (quantitative
sensory testing [QST]), Study 1 will examine emotion regulation difficulties and central sensitization at 6 weeks
post trauma as predictors of persistent pain, distress, and opioid use 6 months post trauma. Study 2 will test
the feasibility of assessing and delivering Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy (EAET) to people
who endorse persistent pain (i.e., clinically significant pain, present most days for the past 3 months) at 6
months post trauma. EAET is a novel chronic pain psychology intervention that treats pain and distress by
targeting trauma-related emotion regulation process. Trauma exposure is ubiquitous among orthopedic trauma
survivors; thus, EAET may be ideally suited for those with persistent pain post trauma. However, the feasibility
of delivering EAET is unclear due to established barriers engaging this population in mental health treatment.
 Proposed research and career development activities will take place at Johns Hopkins University
(JHU), a renowned research environment. JHU is dedicated to the success of its junior faculty and provides
unique access to orthopedic trauma patients. The PI has formed a strong team of content experts in central
sensitization (including QST), psychological intervention (including EAET), and orthopedic trauma. Immersed
in JHU's rich training environment, the PI will achieve the following career goals through dedicated mentorship,
didactic experiences, and professional development opportunities: (1) develop expertise in the assessment of
central sensitization, including QST; (2) gain foundational skills for intervention development, implementation,
and analysis; and (3) learn to lead impactful orthopedic trauma clinical research. The completion of this K23
proposal will provide the necessary training and preliminary data for the PI to obtain independent grant funding
and systematically pursue a line of research to improve outcomes for survivors of orthopedic trauma.",,Anxiety Disorders; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Chronic Pain; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Disability Research; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Pain Research; Physical Injury - Accidents and Adverse Effects; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); Prevention,Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),0.9378103613853455,Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):0.937810; Prevention:0.931309; Pain Research:0.930899
Center for Team Effectiveness to Accelerate EBP Implementation in Children's Mental Health Services: Methods Core,Center for Team Effectiveness to Accelerate EBP Implementation in Children's Mental Health Services: Methods Core,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Methods Core)
Team approaches to meet organizational goals are utilized broadly and globally in industry, the military, space
exploration, and health settings. The TEAMS Methods Core is integral to adapting and advancing team-based
models, approaches, strategies, methods, and evaluation for children’s mental health and for the larger center
activities. Of note, the Methods Core will lead innovation by leveraging natural language processing (NLP)
technology to develop tools to rapidly assess team functioning in real-world settings. Within community service
systems caring for children with mental health needs, the assessment of team effectiveness—although crucial
for improving team functioning—can be a laborious and cumbersome task. Innovations in technology related to
the automatic capturing of communication between team members can lessen the burden in assessing and
improving team effectiveness. The Methods Core will lead innovation by leveraging natural language processing
technology to develop tools to rapidly assess team functioning in real-world settings. The Methods Core
investigators have already been collaborating closely with the Administrative Core, the R01, and the R34 teams,
and Community Service System Workgroup stakeholders in selecting, adapting and shaping strategies and
approaches to implementation and improvement for children’s mental health across service system settings. The
Methods Core is a team effort led by Drs. Aarons (implementation science, mental health), Burke (team
effectiveness, team strategies), and Sklar (mental health services, evaluation) (see biosketches). The Methods
Core is organized to address four aims: Aim 1) Integrate models and strategies from team effectiveness research
and implementation science to improve children’s mental health services, Aim 2) Apply multilevel and advanced
methods and designs for team-based implementation research, and Aim 3) Lead the design and implementation

Statewide System and Organizational Strategy for Evidence-Based Practice Implementation and Sustainment in Substance Use Disorder Treatment,Statewide System and Organizational Strategy for Evidence-Based Practice Implementation and Sustainment in Substance Use Disorder Treatment,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
The NIH has called for testing promising implementation strategies (PAR-19-274) and there is a critical need for
implementation and sustainment of effective and evidence-based practices (EBPs) to address health conditions
including substance use disorders (SUDs). This proposed project is consistent with NIDA’s Priority Focus Area
“Strategies to improve the effective and sustainable implementation of evidence-based prevention and treatment
interventions (implementation science).” Most implementation strategies do not address the complex multilevel
context for implementation in public service sectors. This proposed project will expand the Leadership and
Organizational Change for Implementation (LOCI) intervention, an innovative organizational change strategy for
EBP implementation and sustainment, to include partnership with a statewide Department of Mental Health and
Addiction (DMHA) and Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) in order to align state-level leadership
policies and directives with organizational implementation improvement strategies. SUDs are among the most
complex of public health issues and Indiana ranks as the fourth worst state in providing SUD services with about
8.5% of the population meeting criteria for a SUD, of whom only 13.6% seek treatment. Indiana DMHA
approached the UCSD LOCI team to aid in the implementation of combined Motivational Enhancement
Therapy/Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT) The main innovation in this project is that, consistent with the
Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework and system and organizational theory,
we will add a system level component to LOCI with the goal of bridging outer and inner context and developing
and aligning a positive implementation climate to support implementation and sustainment of MET/CBT for
SUDs. This project will test an implementation strategy that seeks to align, system, organization, and clinic
leadership and strategies to implement and sustain an EBP for substance use disorders. The Leadership and
Organizational Change for Implementation - System Level (LOCI-SL) seeks to improve implementation
leadership, climate, provider attitudes and behaviors, and EBP fidelity and client engagement in services. LOCI-
SL will be tested in a statewide mental health and addiction service system and its community mental health
centers.",,Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Dissemination and Implementation Research; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Health Services; Mental Health; Social Determinants of Health; Substance Misuse,Screening and Brief Intervention for Substance Misuse,0.9420140385627747,Screening and Brief Intervention for Substance Misuse:0.942014; Substance Misuse:0.940358; Dissemination and Implementation Research:0.935204
Strengthening Research Administration Infrastructure for HIV Research in Nigeria,Strengthening Research Administration Infrastructure for HIV Research in Nigeria,"Program Summary
Nigeria has one of the largest HIV epidemics in the world with 1.8 million people living with HIV infection. The
United States government has made huge investments in HIV care and research in Nigeria, through the
Presidents Emergency Funds for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-supported programs and the National Institutes for
Health (NIH) research training grants that have supported the training of researchers in Nigerian universities.
Research on HIV in Nigeria has contributed significantly to the management, treatment, and prevention of HIV
in the country as well to the development of international guidelines worldwide. The University of Nigeria Nsukka
(UNN) College of Medicine has implemented multiple HIV research projects mostly as a sub-awardee. Findings
from our rapid needs assessment with 84 UNN researchers and research administrators indicated that 93% of
researchers expressed interest in submitting grant applications, including for HIV research, but only 28% knew
who to contact for proposal and submission support at UNN. For UNN to successfully submit and manage grant
applications as a prime institution, there is need to strengthen its research administration and management
infrastructure. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) further identify needs and gaps in research administration
and management at UNN; 2) improve the grants management and proposal development knowledge and skills
of UNN research administrators and HIV implementation researchers; and 3) strengthen the ability of UNN
research administrators and HIV implementation researchers to submit and manage successful HIV grant
applications by providing mentorship, ongoing coaching and online courses from UCSD program instructors. UC
San Diego experts in research administration and grant management will implement the objectives of the
proposed infrastructure development training program. The proposed program will be led by Dr. Gregory Aarons,
Professor and Director of UC San Diego Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute Dissemination and
Implementation Science Center (DISC) as Program Director, and Dr. Echezona Ezeanolue, Professor and
Director of UNN Centre for Translation and Implementation Research (CTAIR) as Co-Director. Drs. Aarons and
Ezeanolue have an existing relationship and extensive experience building capacity in Nigerian institutions
through the Nigeria Implementation Science Alliance (NISA). A team of research administration and grant
management experts from UC San Diego will train and provide ongoing mentoring to research administrators
and grant management staff at UNN over a 3-year period. By the end of this infrastructure development training
program, 12 UNN research administrators and grant managers will be able to successfully submit and manage
NIH, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other funded HIV grants.",,Dissemination and Implementation Research; HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases,Building Research Capacity at Institutions with Limited NIH Funding,0.9179922938346863,Building Research Capacity at Institutions with Limited NIH Funding:0.917992; Clinical Research:0.905239; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities:0.904618
ACCESS: Accelerating Cervical Cancer Elimination through the integration of Screen-and-treat Services,ACCESS: Accelerating Cervical Cancer Elimination through the integration of Screen-and-treat Services,"Program Summary
Nigeria has one of the largest HIV epidemics in the world with 1.8 million people living with HIV infection. With
an estimated female population of 102 million and HIV prevalence of 1.6% among adult females, Nigeria has the
largest population of women and the 4th largest number of women living with HIV (WLHIV) in Africa. Although
access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among WLHIV in Nigeria has increased over the years, with over 98% of
the 960,000 WLHIV on ART, AIDS-related mortality remains high. In 2020, 16,000 WLHIV died from AIDS-
related illnesses including cervical cancer. A pilot implementation program in Nigeria demonstrated that
leveraging the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) supported HIV programs for the
provision of evidence-based cervical cancer screen-and-treat interventions in WLWH is feasible. The pilot
program demonstrated, however, that tailored implementation strategies will be needed to address specific
multilevel barriers along the cancer control continuum in order to address adoption, reach, and sustainability that
are necessary for successful scale-up. However, in many African countries with a high burden of both HIV and
cervical cancer, there is a paucity of evidence-based implementation strategies to inform effective integration of
HIV and cervical cancer services delivery. Objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Refine strategies to integrate
cervical cancer screening, treatment and management within existing comprehensive HIV treatment programs
and determine implementation readiness; 2) Determine the comparative effectiveness of a Core set of
implementation strategies versus Core+ enhanced implementation strategies; and 3) assess sustainment of the
integration of cervical cancer screening, treatment, and management intervention into HIV programs. We have
assembled a strong team from University of California San Diego; University of Nigeria, Nsukka and John
Hopkins University with expertise in implementation science, HIV care and research, and cancer care and
research. Our proposal is responsive to the NCI RFA and consistent with the World Health Organization global
plan of elimination of cervical cancer by 2030. If effective, the proposed project will result in a set of feasible,
culturally adaptable, and sustainable implementation strategies to integrate evidence-based cervical cancer
screening and treatment into HIV programs in order to improve the health and life expectancy of WLHIV.",,Behavioral and Social Science; Cancer; Cervical Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Dissemination and Implementation Research; HIV/AIDS; Health Services; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Women's Health Research,Cervical Cancer,0.9245242476463318,Cervical Cancer:0.924524; Cancer:0.916211; Ovarian Cancer:0.913318
Training Program in Cancer Biology,Training Program in Cancer Biology,"Project Summary
The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai proposes to continue a highly successful Training Program in
Cancer Biology for 5 predoctoral students and 5 postdoctoral fellows. The planned duration is up to 2 years
for each predoctoral slot and up to 3 years for each postdoctoral slot. The projected number of individuals to
be trained over the proposed project period is 15 predoctoral and 10 postdoctoral fellows. Its leadership has
extensive experience in cancer research mentoring and a well-documented commitment to both graduate
education and postdoctoral training. This institutional program encompasses training faculty from 6 basic
and 4 clinical departments as well as 12 matrix institutes and involves laboratory and computational
research. The dynamic and interdisciplinary nature of the Program is evidenced by co- authored papers
and multi-investigator grants. All faculty members have peer-reviewed R01 or R01-equivalent support
from funding agencies for cancer-related studies. The Program attracts and develops a cadre of outstanding
Ph.D. and M.D., Ph.D. students, and postdoctoral fellows, with our earliest trainees having established
cancer-focused research careers at prestigious institutions. The curriculum for predoctoral and
postdoctoral trainees involves common elements including several new advanced didactic and multi-modal
cancer biology courses and advanced electives, which impart state-of-the-art training in emerging
technologies critical to basic and translational cancer investigations. All trainees also participate in
regular conferences, which further expose them to clinical aspects of cancer. There are important specific
training elements for each component as well. There is a rigorous evaluation and selection process, and
the program is both cognizant of and actively involved in diversity recruitment. New components of the
program also include additional training venues to specifically aid postdoctoral trainees in seeking
academic positions and a formal training faculty track in which promising junior faculty members may
apply with a training faculty member to co-mentor a highly qualified trainee, an approach providing
mentorship by the training faculty member both of the trainee and the faculty co-mentor. The program has
contributed importantly to the remarkable increase in cancer research and NCI funding over the past
decade. Mount Sinai has also made enormous commitments in resources and facilities benefitting the
Program including support for specific elements by the Tisch Cancer Institute an NCI designated Cancer
Center and the Department of Oncological Sciences. Trainees work closely with faculty drawn from
throughout Mount Sinai ensuring that their training is both rigorous and sufficiently broad in scope to
take into account practical issues faced by physicians in preventing and treating cancer.",,Cancer,Cancer,0.9174162745475769,Cancer:0.917416; Prostate Cancer:0.907638; Breast Cancer:0.904960
Accuracy and Precision in CT Quantification of COPD Through Virtual Imaging Trials,Accuracy and Precision in CT Quantification of COPD Through Virtual Imaging Trials,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death. Increasing in prevalence, COPD
is a major burden to patients and providers. Computed tomography (CT) can provide valuable information
about the structural and functional abnormalities of the disease as demonstrated in numerous studies where
quantitative CT is deployed to characterize and evaluate the treatment. For instance, the COPDGene study
has recently shown the substantial role of quantitative CT in the redefinition of COPD diagnosis, and in
evaluating the progression of emphysema over time. However, these biomarkers vary across different
scanners, settings, and patient attributes. There is a crucial need to manage this variability by optimizing and
harmonizing CT images for reliable biomarker quantifications across both current and emerging scanners.
This goal is not possible through conventional methods of using physical phantoms or patient images. Physical
phantoms are often oversimplified and not representative of the complex anatomy and physiology of COPD
patients. Patient images are ground-truth-limited, i.e., the exact anatomy and physiology of the patient is not
fully known. Further, patient-based comparisons require multiple acquisitions of the same subjects across
different scanners and settings. This is not ethically possible since repeated imaging increases the absorbed
radiation dose. These challenges can be overcome through the use of virtual imaging trials (VITs) where
studies are performed in silico using computational models of patients and scanners. VITs can provide reliable
and practical solution to the challenge of COPD imaging provided realistic models of patients and scanners.
Such models are currently lacking in the context of COPD.
We develop and then utilize realistic virtual imaging toolsets to systematically evaluate and optimize CT
biomarkers in COPD patients across scanners, imaging parameters, and patient attributes. We develop the
first library of realistic COPD patient models with diverse attributes and severities. Coupled with accurate
models of different scanners, the phantoms will be used to generate sets of ground-truth-known virtual CT
cases, to be disseminated to the research community and to be used to systematically evaluate the effects of
current and emerging scanners, various patient attributes, and the effects of image processing algorithms
(through a national challenge), on the accuracy and precision of COPD biomarkers. Further, we develop and
optimize a truth-based artificial intelligence-based algorithm for COPD quantifications. We optimize the
algorithm for accuracy and reproducibility, taking advantage of the ground-truth known simulated images
. We
then harmonize CT settings across different scanners to accurately and precisely assess COPD imaging
biomarkers for both single time-point and longitudinal studies.
The studies will be done for the top two image
processing algorithms, identified in the challenge, as well as our developed algorithm. Through these efforts,
the project will position CT as a more reliable method for improved characterization and monitoring of COPD.",,Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Clinical Research; Lung; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD),Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,0.9349139332771301,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease:0.934914; Emphysema:0.931803; Prevention:0.927791
B cell-T cell crosstalk in celiac disease,B cell-T cell crosstalk in celiac disease,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Celiac disease (CeD) is a complex intestinal inflammatory disorder that is triggered by dietary gluten and
develops in genetically susceptible individuals expressing HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 molecules. 1% of the
worldwide population is affected by this disease for which the only effective treatment is a lifelong and
restrictive gluten-free diet (GFD). Yet, persistent symptoms and enteropathy remain commonplace even
among CeD patients that adhere to a GFD. This stresses the need to develop non-dietary interventions for
CeD. The development of new therapies has however proven challenging because of our incomplete
understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying CeD pathogenesis and the lack of a suitable mouse
model. CeD is characterized by the loss of oral tolerance to gluten manifested by HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8-
restricted anti-gluten inflammatory CD4 T cells in the small intestinal mucosa and by a massive expansion of
cytotoxic intraepithelial CD8+ lymphocytes (IE-CTLs) that are involved in the killing of intestinal epithelial cells.
These observations have led to the general idea that CeD is primarily a T cell-mediated immune disorder. We
hypothesize, however, that B cells also play a critical role. This hypothesis stems from several observations.
First, CeD is characterized by a considerable expansion of plasma cells in the mucosa of CeD patients as well
as the development of anti-deamidated gluten peptides (DGP) antibodies and autoantibodies against the
enzyme tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Second, the main model to explain the production of anti-DGP and
anti-TG2 antibodies is that gluten-specific CD4+ T cells provide help to B cells suggesting that B cells could act
as antigen-presenting cells for T cells and promote the amplification of the anti-gluten CD4 T cell response.
Finally, several case reports on patients having CeD associated with another autoimmune disease suggest
that B cell depletion therapy can provide clinical benefit in CeD, and we have demonstrated that B cell
depletion significantly reduces intestinal tissue damage in our mouse model of CeD. The objective of this
application is to characterize in vivo the role of B cells in amplifying the anti-gluten T cell response and allow it
to reach a sufficient magnitude to promote tissue destruction. This project is innovative as it employs unique
mouse models of CeD allowing to manipulate B lymphocytes, gluten-specific T cells, the gluten antigen, and
the CeD predisposing HLA molecule to 1) assess the contribution of B cells as antigen-presenting to the
activation and amplification of the anti-gluten CD4+ T cell response, and 2) assess the role of B cells and
antibodies in the activation of IE-CTLs and tissue destruction. The knowledge gained from this study will
provide unprecedented insights into the mechanisms by which B cell-mediated immunity contribute to the
pathogenesis of CeD and will assess for the first time the therapeutic potential of B cell depletion therapy in an
experimental mouse model of CeD.",,Autoimmune Disease; Celiac Disease; Digestive Diseases; Immunotherapy; Nutrition,Celiac Disease,0.9500314593315125,Celiac Disease:0.950031; Autoimmune Disease:0.943594; Crohn's Disease:0.939399

Biological Mechanisms Core - RC2,Biological Mechanisms Core - RC2,"Resource Core 2 (RC2) Biological Mechanisms Core: Project Summary
The identification of the etiologies of frailty and age-related vulnerability remains a crucial challenge for
gerontological research. Key to this challenge are the development of a better understanding of the underlying
biological basis that contributes to frailty and the identification of key biological pathways for the development
of interventions that might help prevent or alleviate frailty and loss of independence. The goal of Johns Hopkins
Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) Biological Mechanisms Core (RC-2) is to enable the next
generation of frailty-related etiological discovery and to promote the translation of these discoveries into
clinically relevant diagnostic, preventive, and treatment modalities. This will be achieved through the provision
of high-quality biological and bioengineering measurement expertise, incorporation of new technologies,
analytical and computational expertise for genetics and omics analyses, and infrastructure necessary to attain
this goal. In order to comprehensively encompass the biological expertise necessary to study frailty-related
etiology, we have engaged a leadership team and internal consultants with complementary and synergistic
biological and translational expertise needed to unravel the complex biological mechanisms that underpin
frailty. They also all bring mentorship skills for trainees, and infrastructure to RC-2 and national prominence to
frailty research. The specific aims of RC-2 are to: 1) provide state of the art scientific expertise, infrastructure,
and technology necessary to advance biological and etiological research related to frailty, 2) provide access to
biological samples from human subjects and from animal models necessary to test hypotheses related to
frailty, 3) facilitate the translation of biological findings into interventions or prevention-focused clinical studies,
4) provide training, mentorship, and guidance to promising junior investigators around biological mechanisms
that impact frailty, and 5) provide institutional and external visibility for RC-2 related science and activities. Our
aims will be accomplished through close communication between the core leaders and their laboratories, close
partnership with the other OAIC cores, and the engagement of expert consultants in the highly relevant areas
of mitochondrial measurement, metabolomics, epigenetics, mouse model development, nanotechnologies for
diagnostic and treatment development, and the development of multi-omic analyses related to frailty. By
providing these resources, RC-2 will foster high quality research that elucidates clinically relevant biological

Translational Aging Research Training Program,Translational Aging Research Training Program,"The U.S. population is aging rapidly, with a rising burden of chronic diseases, functional impairments, and cognitive decline among older adults. In parallel, major scientific advances have expanded our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying aging and have introduced engineering and bioengineering innovations with the potential to extend healthspan, the period of life spent in good health. However, a persistent gap remains in translating these discoveries into real-world interventions that improve clinical outcomes and enhance healthspan for older adults.
To address this translational gap, the Translational Aging Research Training Program was launched in 2018 to develop future leaders in aging research. Despite disruptions due to COVID-19, the program successfully trained 14 fellows from clinical, biological, and engineering, disciplines. This renewal proposes an enhanced program embedded in the interdisciplinary ecosystem of the Johns Hopkins Human Aging Project (HAP), an institutional initiative that foster collaborative research and training to extend the healthspan and improve the lives of older adults. 
This program will continue to leverage strong scientific leadership, a rich research infrastructure, and a supportive environment that welcomes individuals from all backgrounds committed to excellence in aging research. Its specific aims are to:
1) Deliver an interdisciplinary training experience in translational aging research for postdoctoral fellows (MD and/or PhD), structured around core coursework, interdisciplinary meetings, weekly translational aging seminars, individualized development plans, and leadership training.
2) Provide each fellow with a mentored research experience in translational aging science, either in biology, engineering, or clinical research.
3) Enable access to a broad network of resources and aging-focused research infrastructure at Johns Hopkins.
4) Prepare trainees for long-term success in academic careers through individualized mentoring and professional development activities.

Geriatrics Research: From Bench-to-Bedside,Geriatrics Research: From Bench-to-Bedside,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Resilience, defined as the ability to respond to stressors, declines with age and co-morbid conditions in older
organisms. To date, little progress has been made to improve our understanding of resilience with aging and
its multi-component dimensions in response to physical, cognitive, and social stressors, in part because
resilience itself is likely a dynamic multi-systemic process that is most evident under conditions of stress. This
application is for a five-year cooperative conference grant to continue the successful “Geriatrics Research:
Bench-to-Bedside” series. The series has had an outstanding impact. Past conferences represented
“paradigm-shifting” moments and “pivotal” junctures in areas such as frailty, multimorbidity, and delirium. Here
we propose to build bridges and bring together resilience scientists and experts from the physical, cognitive,
and social domains to discuss, debate, and learn from each other the dynamic multi-component phenomena of
resilience. In the first conference, Overview of the Resilience World: State of the Science, we will focus on
setting the stage and discuss working definitions of resilience from physical, cognitive, and psychosocial fields.
A goal will be to identify areas of commonalities and differences and how we can operationalize a shared
concept so that “resilience” can be quantified appropriately in different contexts. In the second conference,
Stress tests and Biomarkers of Resilience, we aim to discuss resilience stress test paradigms and
molecular markers that may be associated with resilient outcomes. Building on the first conference, this
conference will refer to operationalized definitions of resilience and resilient outcomes, acknowledging that
definitions may differ slightly across fields and contexts. Lastly, the third conference is entitled Optimizing
Resilience. By integrating the foundation built in the first two conferences, we will focus on interventions to
optimize resilience in older adults. This conference series, once completed, will serve as a forum and a
unifying thread that will bring together national research leaders to build an integrative multidimensional
understanding of resilience in older organisms.",,Aging; Behavioral and Social Science,Regenerative Medicine,0.9324953556060791,Regenerative Medicine:0.932495; Sarcopenia:0.931683; Rehabilitation:0.930196
Sex Differences in Gut Metabolite-Immune Interplay in Hypertension and Renal End-Organ Damage,Sex Differences in Gut Metabolite-Immune Interplay in Hypertension and Renal End-Organ Damage,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nearly half of the ~116 million Americans with hypertension are salt-sensitive and confer a 3-fold higher risk of
developing cardiovascular disease. Only 26% of hypertensive patients reach blood pressure (BP) control, which
may be due to lack of studies in females despite the growing evidence for sex differences in hypertensive
mechanisms. It is known that the gut microbiota and immune system are critical in hypertension in males; this is
largely unknown in females. The objective of this grant is to address this knowledge gap regarding the role of
the gut microbiota and immune system to mediate sex differences in salt-sensitive hypertension. Mechanistic
studies will be performed in male and female Dahl Salt-Sensitive (SS) rats, with translational studies performed
in samples from opposite-sex twin pairs where the males have hypertension compared to females.
Dahl SS rats, a model consistent with human salt-sensitive hypertension, exhibit a greater degree of salt-
sensitivity and associated end-organ damage in males compared to females. We have observed stark sex
differences in gut microbiota composition and gut-derived metabolites. Through microbiota transfer studies, we
know the gut microbiota plays a causal role in the regulation of BP and renal damage. Linking the microbiota to
immunity, microbiota transfer also influences renal T cell infiltration. Genetic deletion of T cells (SSCD247–/–)
eliminates sex differences in salt-sensitive hypertension, highlighting the role of T cells to mediate BP sex
differences. Since the gut microbiota influences renal T cell infiltration, and T cells amplify salt-sensitive
hypertension, we have strong rationale for studying how sex-specific microbiota impact T cell function and salt-
sensitivity. We will test the central hypothesis that gut microbiota-dependent T cell activation determines
the extent of salt-sensitive hypertension and mediates the sex differences in disease severity.
Our hypothesis will be rigorously tested with three aims: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the gut microbiota
drives sex differences in salt-sensitive hypertension. Sex-specific microbiota transfer and gonadectomy studies
will reveal whether the gut microbiota sex- and hormone-dependently contributes to salt-sensitive hypertension
in SS rats. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the male versus female gut microbiota influences sex differences
in T cell function and activation. Microbiota transfer in SSCD247–/– rats lacking T cells will assess the impact of sex
and gut microbiota on T cell bioenergetics and cytokine production, and will address whether T cells are required
for gut microbiota-dependent salt-sensitive hypertension. Aim 3 will determine whether the sex-specific
observations in gut microbiota, gut metabolites, and T cell function in the SS rat similarly parallel humans from
a longitudinal opposite-sex twin cohort, where the males exhibit hypertension compared to their female twin pair.
These studies will reveal key mechanisms related to gut microbiota-immune-kidney crosstalk and provide the
preclinical and human basis for developing novel, sex-specific targets to improve BP control and kidney disease.",,Cardiovascular; Hypertension; Kidney Disease; Microbiome; Women's Health Research,Hypertension,0.9168753623962402,Hypertension:0.916875; Urologic Diseases:0.909334; Kidney Disease:0.908382
Mechanism of innate immune activation by intestinal distension,Mechanism of innate immune activation by intestinal distension,"SUMMARY
The ability to distinguish harmful and beneficial microbes is critical for the survival of an organism. Increasing
evidence indicates that gut distension caused by bacterial colonization activates a broad innate immune
response. We propose that microbial colonization and bloating of the intestine may be perceived as a danger
signal that activates an immune fight-and-flight response. This innate immune activation depends on inputs
from the intestine that can aid in the recognition of a broad range of microbes and can modulate host
responses using a neural-gut axis that controls immune homeostasis. This proposal describes experiments
designed to elucidate the mechanisms by which the nervous system may sense overall changes in host
physiology during pathogen infections and coordinate innate immune responses. Using the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans, we have demonstrated that specific genes and neurons in the nervous system of the
animal control immune responses, indicating that cell non-autonomous signals from different neurons may act
on non-neural tissues to regulate innate immune responses at the organismal level. We propose the use of a
variety of molecular and genetic techniques to explore the general hypothesis that alterations in host
physiology caused by bacterial infections trigger innate immune responses against bacterial infections that are
controlled at that whole animal level by the nervous system.",,Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Neurosciences,Digestive Diseases - (Peptic Ulcer),0.9180634021759033,Digestive Diseases - (Peptic Ulcer):0.918063; Inflammatory Bowel Disease:0.913946; Digestive Diseases:0.908872
Genetic analysis of innate immunity using C. elegans,Genetic analysis of innate immunity using C. elegans,"Increasing evidence suggests that the intestine plays an important role in sensing not only the presence
of pathogens but also changes in the microbiota, which ultimately result in changes in the regulation of
immune pathways and behaviors by communicating with neurons. However, the complexity of the
nervous and immune systems of mammals makes it difficult to dissect the mechanisms by which the
neural-gut axis communicates using bidirectional signals to control intestinal immunity. Studies in the
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans show that bacterial colonization of the intestine results in the
activation of the expression of innate immune genes in the gut and the activation of a neuroendocrine
signal that controls pathogen avoidance. The germline also plays a key role in the neural-gut axis not
only by transmitting the immunological memory to the next generation but also by communicating
pathogenic cues that travel from the gut to the nervous system to control innate immunity. The long-term
goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism by which the neural-germline-gut axis communicates
to sense pathogens and/or infection-induced physiological changes to control innate immunity at the
whole animal level. Thus, we will explore the general hypothesis that the neural-germline-gut axis plays
a critical role in the organismal response against bacterial pathogens by helping the nervous system
integrate signals from infected sites and different tissues to coordinate the immune response. Specific
genes and neurons will be studied to dissect the neural circuits that regulate immune activation in
response to pathogen exposure and pathogen-induced alterations of the animal’s physiology. A
genetics approach will also be used to identify neurotransmitters and endocrine signals potentially
involved in the neural-immune communication that takes place between neurons and different tissues
and infected sites.",,Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Neurosciences,Neurosciences,0.9100234508514404,Neurosciences:0.910023; Microbiome:0.909787; Celiac Disease:0.909442

Does Health Insurance Promote Health through Providers and Networks?
Through their varying provider networks and coverages, health insurance plans directly and indirectly steer
patients toward some clinicians and hospitals and away from others. If providers differ in their quality of
care and especially if they provide better care for certain types of patients, such network variation can
meaningfully affect health outcomes at the plan level, and not just the provider level. Yet, consumers
selecting health plans lack information about which plans will direct them to better providers, obscuring this
potentially important channel to improving population health.
This project will develop novel outcome-based measures of insurance plan quality based on where
enrollees receive care, and taking account how causal impacts on health vary across provider networks. By
furthering the scientific understanding of the relationship between provider quality and patient outcomes at
the plan level, we aim to equip patients with new information for selecting insurance plans. Our measures
will also provide regulators with new instruments to reward plans that make people healthier.
At the core of our research plan are new, causal estimates of how mortality impacts vary across hospitals
and physicians and, in turn, across the health plans that rely on different provider networks. We focus on
older Americans enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans, leveraging novel data on the provider networks
used by different Medicare Advantage plans. The estimates will characterize which hospitals and providers
produce the best outcomes for beneficiaries with different demographics and comorbidities and thus which
plans are suitable for each type of patient by directing them to providers who produce good outcomes for
conditions they have or are likely to develop.
The project has four primary aims:
Aim 1: Measure and Validate Mortality Effects for Healthcare Providers
Aim 2: Link Physician and Hospital Mortality Effects to Plan Mortality Effects
Aim 3: Explore Heterogeneity in Mortality Effects Across Beneficiaries

2/2 Video Telehealth Pulmonary Rehabilitation to Reduce Hospital Readmission in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (Tele-COPD),2/2 Video Telehealth Pulmonary Rehabilitation to Reduce Hospital Readmission in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (Tele-COPD),"Project Summary/Abstract
 Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) result in significant morbidity and
healthcare costs, especially severe exacerbations that require hospitalization. Traditional bronchodilators and anti-
inflammatory medications, as well as programs to monitor and treat symptoms, have a modest effect on reducing
hospital admissions. Readmission rates remain unacceptably high, so alternative approaches are needed. In this
regard, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is remarkably effective, and is associated with an 80% reduction in admission
rates. Successful completion of PR is also associated with substantial improvements in quality of life, dyspnea, as
well as exercise tolerance. Despite these benefits, recent studies have highlighted very poor referral rates for PR
overall and as low as 1.9% post-hospitalization, and non-completion rates as high as 60%. The poor adaptation of
PR in the community is due to a combination of barriers in availability and accessibility, as well as attrition. The
number of PR centers in the United States is inadequate, and these centers are mostly distributed in urban areas.
In addition, multiple socioeconomic and medical barriers hinder access to PR, and contribute to high drop-out rates.
 New strategies are needed to reduce hospital readmission in COPD, and to increase the delivery of PR to
underserved urban as well as rural areas in the community. Given the scarcities in existing resources, conventional
models of care delivery are being challenged, and attempts are being made to find alternative, cost-effective ways
of delivering healthcare to a larger number of eligible patients. To overcome the socioeconomic and physical
barriers to PR, we hypothesize that a video telehealth intervention that will deliver PR to the patient's home,
regardless of geographic location, will reduce hospital readmissions in COPD, and reduce respiratory morbidity. To
test our hypothesis we propose a prospective randomized controlled phase 3 multicenter clinical trial comparing a
real-time video telehealth PR intervention plus standard of care versus standard of care alone, with the following
Specific Aims: (1) To determine if a video telehealth PR intervention reduces 30-day all-cause readmissions in
patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of COPD, (2) To evaluate the effects of the video telehealth PR
intervention on dyspnea and respiratory quality of life in COPD post hospital discharge, and (3) To evaluate the
cost-effectiveness of the telehealth intervention. Accomplishment of the aims of this study will result in a significant
reduction in COPD readmission rates, and a paradigm shift in the way PR is delivered to patients with COPD,
especially those that reside in remote and rural areas with limited access to pulmonary rehabilitation.",,Behavioral and Social Science; Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Cost Effectiveness Research; Health Disparities Research; Health Disparities and Racial or Ethnic Minority Health Research; Health Services; Lung; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Patient Safety; Physical Activity; Physical Rehabilitation; Rehabilitation; Rural Health; Social Determinants of Health; Telehealth,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,0.9301729798316956,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease:0.930173; Palliative Care:0.927428; Telehealth:0.926678
Cerebral Hemodynamics and Stroke in HIV-associated TB Meningitis.,Cerebral Hemodynamics and Stroke in HIV-associated TB Meningitis.,"Abstract
Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) disproportionally affects people in low- and middle-income countries and is
associated with high morbidity and mortality. Stroke is a common complication in TBM and can lead to severe
irreversible neurological disability. Studies on TBM-associated stroke pathology, however, have focused
primarily on HIV-uninfected individuals. The overall objective of this proposal is to use transcranial doppler and
brain imaging to understand changes in cerebral blood vessels and cerebral blood flow in order to determine
changes in cerebrovascular responsiveness, characterize patterns of stroke, and describe long-term
neurocognitive outcomes in HIV-associated TBM. The central hypothesis is that in HIV-infected individuals,
TBM causes extensive cerebral vascular narrowing and impaired cerebrovascular responsiveness, decreased
cerebral blood flow, and ultimately stroke. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims:
1) describe changes in cerebrovascular responsiveness in HIV-associated TBM; 2) characterize the patterns of
stroke in HIV-associated TBM and determine whether it is associated with vasculopathy and/or impairments in
cerebrovascular responsiveness; and 3) determine if impaired cerebrovascular responsiveness predicts long-
term neurological outcome in HIV-associated TBM. Under Aim 1, transcranial doppler will be used to take
repeated measurements of the middle cerebral artery flow velocity and pulsatility index. A subset of study
subjects will also have dynamic measurements made in response to stimuli (inhaled CO2, changes in blood
pressure, and motor tasks). We will determine whether cerebrovascular responsiveness is impaired in HIV-
associated TBM by comparing measurements to those of control patients with no neurological infection. Under
Aim 2, all study subjects will have a brain MRI performed within the first 2-weeks of TBM treatment to identify
the presence of a cerebral artery stroke and the associated cerebral artery territory. We will compare TCD
readings between participants with or without stroke. Under Aim 3, we will examine how TCD measurements at
study enrolment relate to the results of neurocognitive testing at month 2 and functional assessment at month
6. Ultimately, the long-term goal of the proposal is to describe how impaired cerebrovascular responsiveness in
HIV-associated TBM contributes to the development of strokes and resulting neurocognitive impairment and
disability. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it incorporates the use of
transcranial doppler at the bedside, to be used in real time, in the care of subjects with TBM. The proposed
research is significant because it is expected to provide strong scientific justification for the development of
future clinical trials testing targeted interventions to improve cerebrovascular responsiveness and prevent the
development of strokes in HIV-associated TBM. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential of preventing the
development of irreversible neurological injury and improving both short and long-term outcomes.",,Biodefense and Related Countermeasures; Biomedical Imaging; Brain Disorders; Cerebrovascular; Clinical Research; Emerging Infectious Diseases; HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases; Stroke; Tuberculosis,Stroke,0.9347270727157593,Stroke:0.934727; Brain Disorders:0.932456; Cerebrovascular:0.931443
Targeting Neuropathogenesis of Altered Mental Status to Improve Survival in Cryptococcal Meningitis,Targeting Neuropathogenesis of Altered Mental Status to Improve Survival in Cryptococcal Meningitis,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Dr. Mahsa Abassi is an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the
University of Minnesota. Over the past six years, she has been engaged in clinical research, focusing on HIV-
related neuroinfections in Uganda. Her long-term objective is to become an independent clinical researcher
with an emphasis on improving outcomes in neuroinfections. Her career development plan proposes mentored
training in: 1) neurologic techniques (EEGs, neuroradiology, and neurocognitive assessment), 2) laboratory
techniques related to metabolomics applications, and 4) biostatistics with an emphasis of analyzing
metabolites in biologic samples.
 Research: Cryptococcal meningitis accounts for 15% of HIV/AIDS-related deaths globally and is the most
common cause of adult meningitis in Africa. Altered mental status (ranging from delirium to coma) at the time
of cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis is consistently an independent predictor of increased mortality. Despite
repeated studies confirming this strong association between altered mental status and death, there is a
fundamental lack of understanding into the exact neurological abnormalities leading to acute altered mental
status, its contributions to increased mortality, and the best practices for management.
 The objective of this proposal is to identify the neurological abnormalities that contribute to altered mental
status and to understand how this contributes to increased cryptococcal mortality. The overarching hypothesis
is that cryptococcal meningitis with its increased intracranial pressure leads to cerebral hypoxia, abnormal
electrical activity, and biochemical changes in the central nervous system (CNS) that can be detected through
brain metabolite CSF analysis and enhanced clinical monitoring with cerebral oximetry and EEGs. This
proposal aims to: 1) determine if HIV-infected persons with cryptococcal meningitis presenting with altered
mental status (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <15) at diagnosis have measurable underlying neurological
abnormalities and impairments in cerebral energy metabolism (i.e. insufficient oxidative metabolism) as
compared to persons with normal mental status (GCS=15); and 2) determine if implementation of standardized
clinical interventions can reverse neurological abnormalities and improve cerebral energy metabolism within 3
days of diagnosis, and reduce 30-day mortality in HIV-infected persons with cryptococcal meningitis presenting
with altered mental status (GCS<15). Results of the above aims will shed light into previously unknown
pathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to altered mental status in cryptococcal meningitis. The training in
neuroinfections, metabolomics applications, and biostatistics that Dr. Abassi will obtain will inform future
proposals dedicated to understanding the neuropathology of various neuroinfections and finding evidence-
based interventions dedicated to improving survival.",,Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Infectious Diseases; Neurosciences,Alzheimer's Disease,0.927327573299408,Alzheimer's Disease:0.927328; Neurodegenerative:0.923443; Mental Illness:0.922722
Identification of regulatory mechanisms operating in rare pathogenic astrocyte subsets in multiple sclerosis with a novel genomic technology,Identification of regulatory mechanisms operating in rare pathogenic astrocyte subsets in multiple sclerosis with a novel genomic technology,"ABSTRACT
Single-cell genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic technologies can identify unique cell subsets with important
physiologic roles; however, RNA or DNA signatures cannot always be linked to unique surface markers,
hampering the re-isolation of these cell subsets for in-depth analyses. Moreover, conventional single-cell
methods require sequencing prohibitively large numbers of cells to characterize rare subsets. Here we will
develop and apply SEARCH-seq, a high-throughput cytometry method that detects RNA or DNA markers with
single molecule sensitivity that allows the rapid isolation of target cells for in-depth transcriptomic, genomic, or
epigenomic analyses. We will use the method to study the regulatory mechanisms controlling an astrocyte
subpopulation characterized by an alternatively spliced XBP1 transcript, which promotes disease pathology in
multiple sclerosis (MS). This subpopulation also manifests in the pre-clinical mouse model of experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Using SEARCH-seq in combination with conditional knock-out mice, in
vivo CRISPR/Cas9-driven perturbation studies, and RNA-seq analyses of mouse EAE and human MS samples,
we will characterize the role of these cells and their interaction with the nuclear receptor NR3C2 and its
corepressor NCOR2 in limiting XBP1-driven pathogenic astrocyte responses. In summary, SEARCH-seq is a
novel, sensitive, and high throughput method to capture rare brain cell subsets that are difficult to study with
existing technology and may have therapeutically targetable mechanisms relevant to MS pathogenesis.",,Autoimmune Disease; Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Genetics; Human Genome; Multiple Sclerosis; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences,Rare Diseases,0.9286529421806335,Rare Diseases:0.928653; Autoimmune Disease:0.928496; Multiple Sclerosis:0.923468
Gigapixel Next-Generation-Sequencing: An Ultra-Sensitive Diagnostic for Infections of the CNS,Gigapixel Next-Generation-Sequencing: An Ultra-Sensitive Diagnostic for Infections of the CNS,"ABSTRACT
Infectious diseases remain a significant cause of morbidity worldwide, highlighting the critical need for accurate
diagnosis. However, shared symptoms among different infections and the emergence of drug resistance make
diagnosis and treatment selection challenging. In this competing renewal, we propose to develop Gigapixel NGS
(gNGS) to enable rapid, sensitive, and information-rich infectious disease diagnosis. gNGS builds upon our
Gigapixel PCR (gPCR) technology by incorporating powerful next-generation sequencing capabilities. By
utilizing double emulsion vesicles for single cell assays, gNGS eliminates the need for specialized droplet
analyzers and allows common flow cytometers to be used for genome isolation.
Our goal in this renewal is to leverage the capabilities of Gigapixel NGS to detect, isolate, and sequence
infectious pathogen genomes from patient samples, which will improve the efficiency and sensitivity of pathogen
sequencing. We will collaborate with Dr. Charles Chiu, a renowned expert in infectious disease diagnostics who
leads the CLIA-certified pathogen lab at UCSF, to develop clinical workflows and bioinformatic tools for
interrogating the recovered genomes for relevant biomarker sequences, including virulence factors and drug
resistance genes. Dr. Chiu's expertise in infectious disease diagnostics and practical experience in clinical
sample sequencing for pathogen detection will ensure that the new diagnostic is effective and practical in a
clinical setting.",,Antimicrobial Resistance; Biodefense and Related Countermeasures; Biotechnology; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Neurosciences; Orthopoxviruses; Rare Diseases; Vector-Borne Diseases; West Nile Virus; Zika Virus,Emerging Infectious Diseases,0.9200988411903381,Emerging Infectious Diseases:0.920099; Precision Medicine:0.917608; Rare Diseases:0.914455
Next Generation Infectious Disease Diagnostics: Microfluidic-Free Gigapixel PCR with Self-Assembled Partitioning,Next Generation Infectious Disease Diagnostics: Microfluidic-Free Gigapixel PCR with Self-Assembled Partitioning,"ABSTRACT
Infections by different pathogens can manifest with similar symptoms, but appropriate treatment requires specific
and accurate diagnosis. Clinicians often turn to multiplexed assays testing for many organisms (e.g. BioFire).
While these approaches can test for 50-70 organisms, they do not provide concentration titers, which is
necessary to identify the causative pathogen among the several false positives or clinically meaningless
commensals. As a result, the clinician must perform additional tests to identify which of the positives is causative.
Although these tests use quantitative PCR, in clinical labs the results are reported as presence/absence due to
the finicky nature of PCR in this setting, which is sensitive to minor variations in reaction efficiency, operator
variability. As a result, today, only a few widespread PCR tests are FDA approved to report quantitative result.
In contrast to qPCR, digital PCR (dPCR) measures target titers by counting individual molecules. As a result,
dPCR provides an absolute concentration measurement that doesn’t require a standard curve. In addition, the
reaction is cycled to endpoint, then quantified; it does not require careful estimation of the amplification rate,
which is a major source of variability in qPCR. Thus, dPCR is less sensitive to variations in reaction efficiency
and provides superior consistency. However, current dPCR methods are limited in multiplexing, allowing just 5-
6 targets per assay, while qPCR can test up to 100. Moreover, dPCR requires complex microfluidic equipment
that burdens testing lab personnel and increases cost. Until these issues can be addressed, qPCR will continue
to dominate the clinical lab, and quantitative and absolute pathogen load reporting will remain beyond reach.
Here, we propose a novel nucleic acid technology combining the quantitativeness and robustness of dPCR with
the simplicity and multiplexing of qPCR. Our vision is to enable broad spectrum detection wherein each pathogen
is associated with a high confidence, quantitative titer. Our approach – gigapixel PCR (gPCR) – is enabled by
our recent discoveries of self-assembled partitioning, for microfluidic-free generation of monodispersed
emulsions, and linearized target quantitation with capillary electrophoresis (CE). CE allows sensitive quantitation
over 7 decades and provides amplicon length information with single nucleotide resolution. In gPCR, we use this
to perform multiplexed detection of over 100 amplicons per reaction. In contrast to qPCR, which requires that
the sample be split to test for different targets, thereby diluting it and reducing sensitivity, with gPCR the targets
are tested without splitting, maintaining them at maximal concentration, and substantially increasing sensitivity.
Moreover, based on robust dPCR, gPCR provides reproducible, quantitative results across testing conditions. It
thus addresses the major limitations of current dPCR technologies and provides the first viable alternative to
qPCR in the clinic. We will develop and validate the technology against accepted standards (SeraCare), and
work with our longstanding collaborators (Drs. Melanie Ott and Charles Chiu) to apply it to respiratory and CNS
infections from samples previously collected at UCSF hospitals.",,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Neurosciences; Vector-Borne Diseases,Precision Medicine,0.9286044836044312,Precision Medicine:0.928604; Emerging Infectious Diseases:0.924778; Coronaviruses Diagnostics and Prognostics:0.921790
A non-invasive metabolic sensor for improving success in IVF,A non-invasive metabolic sensor for improving success in IVF,"ABSTRACT
Embryos cultured external to the body are exposed to non-physiologic conditions that can impair the health of
the future adult. Moreover, culture stress reduces immediate embryo viability and implantation success,
motivating multiple embryo transfers and leading to high rates of multiple pregnancies. These pregnancies are
risky for fetus and mother and exhibit a high healthcare cost burden. To address this, embryos are screened
based on early-stage morphology to identify the healthiest for transfer, but this approach achieves limited
success and is highly dependent on the individual conducting the test. An accurate and objective screening
method would increase implantation rates and reduce the need for multiple transfers, in addition to yielding
healthier offspring. The objective of this project is to develop a new technology for noninvasive IVF embryo
selection. Dr. Paolo Rinaudo, Co-I on this grant, is a Reproductive Endocrinologist working at the UCSF Center
for Reproductive Health which performs >2000 IVF procedures per year and has commitment to research.
Through experience derived from two decades of work in IVF, he identified that current methods for screening
embryos are inadequate, with the gold standard, morphological selection, achieving a positive predictive value
of just 30%. While an embryo may appear morphologically healthy, it may not be molecularly healthy, which may
affect the long-term development of the fetus. Among his two decades of research on cultured embryos and IVF
is the finding that ex vivo culture can stress embryos and drive Warburg-like metabolism. In addition, culture
stress has now been correlated to long-term negative health outcomes, including abnormal placental
development, metabolic dysfunction, hypertension, and diabetes. Dr. Rinaudo hypothesized that metabolically
active embryos lower their culture droplet pH, similar to how Warburg metabolism acidifies the environment
around cancer cells, thereby affording a simple way to select the best embryos for transfer. His research has
confirmed this, but the technique cannot be translated to practice because there is no effective and reliable pH
measuring method for the culture droplet due to its tiny volume. Armed with this concept, he reached out to Dr.
Adam Abate, a physicist and engineer at UCSF. Dr. Abate is a leader in microfluidics and nanotechnology with
a record of developing and translating health care technologies to practice, having founded multiple companies
commercializing his inventions, including Fluent Biosciences (genomics), Mission Bio (oncology diagnostics) and
Scribe (cell & gene therapy). Together, Drs. Rinaudo and Abate have designed a novel hydrogel biosensor that
non-invasively measures culture droplet pH. Being an IVF clinician, Dr. Rinaudo is aware of the regulatory and
practical constraints of IVF operations and thus ensured the design is feasible for this setting by making it simple,
non-invasive, and cost-effective. This grant will develop the technology and validate its efficacy in a mouse model
of IVF, providing critical data for a follow-on R01. The project is thus based on a rigorous scientific foundation,
decades of clinical experience, and comprises a team capable of translating science discoveries to the clinic.",,Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Contraception/Reproduction; Pregnancy,Biomedical Imaging,0.9204448461532593,Biomedical Imaging:0.920445; Conditions Affecting the Embryonic and Fetal Periods:0.916603; Diabetes:0.915383
"Understanding the influence of bone-metastatic prostate cancer and mesenchymal stromal cells on γδ T cells, in the bone microenvironment.","Understanding the influence of bone-metastatic prostate cancer and mesenchymal stromal cells on γδ T cells, in the bone microenvironment.","While immunotherapies have made strides in the treatment of other cancers, castrate resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC) remains largely unresponsive, underscoring the need for novel approaches. One such approach relies
on the administration of autologous T cells genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)
that recognize specific tumor-associated antigens. Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA) is widely expressed in
prostate cancer and we have previously developed a CAR targeting PSCA that has potent in vivo efficacy. To
target bone metastatic CRPC (mCRPC), we propose to manipulate a specific subset of T cells, called γδ that
can be driven to the skeleton via systemic treatment with bisphosphonates such as zoledronate (ZOL) that is
clinically used to limit cancer-induced bone disease in men with bone mCRPC. Importantly, ZOL treatment
induces accumulation of phosphoantigens in tumor cells, which are detected by γδ T cells. Our preliminary
findings show that ZOL can enhance γδ T-cells' homing to bone where they can prevent cancer growth via
CAR and via endogenous T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition. γδ CAR-T treatment, in presence or absence of
ZOL, can mitigate cancer-induced bone deterioration. Moreover, we found that soluble factors secreted by
bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) can increase the cytotoxic potential of γδ CART cells.
Finally, we found that the choice of CAR structural and costimulatory moieties affects the phenotype and
fuction αβ and γδ T cells differentially, requiring the design of CARs optimized for γδ T cells. Based on these
preliminary findings we hypothesize that the homing and cytotoxic activity of γδ CAR-T cells for the
treatment of bone metastatic CRPC can be greatly enhanced through genetic, pharmacological, and
microenvironmental approaches. We will test our hypothesis by; 1) Defining the optimum γδ CAR-T design
that will significantly enhance CRPC cytotoxicity. We will test the biological implications of choosing alternative
CAR transmembrane and costimulatory domains, with a specific focus on their ability to modulate the
expression of cytokine receptors. We will also dissect the specific signaling pathways that can govern γδ CAR-
T cell persistence. Finally, we will identify the molecular signaling pathways triggered by CARs with different
costimulatory domains. 2) Determining if ZOL can drive γδ CAR-T recruitment and anti-bone mCRPC activity in
vivo. We will use xenograft and PDX models of bone mCRPC to characterize the bioavailability and therapeutic
efficacy of γδ CAR-T + ZOL; and an immunocompetent model to map sites of phosphoantigen accumulation.
3) Dissecting the reciprocal effects of γδ CAR-T on the bone mCRPC microenvironment. We will analyze the
impact of γδ CAR-T + ZOL treatment on the structure and physiology of the bone, and the effects of MSC on
the performance of γδ CAR-T cells in vivo. Based on the anticipated results, characterizing the specific
properties of the bone/tumor microenvironment will reveal novel insights thereby providing a strong rationale
for the translation of immunotherapies tailored to eliminate currently incurable bone mCRPC.",,Biotechnology; Cancer; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Immunotherapy; Prostate Cancer; Urologic Diseases,Prostate Cancer,0.9234994649887085,Prostate Cancer:0.923499; Precision Medicine:0.915639; Immunotherapy:0.911510
KIR2DL2 Immune Checkpoint as Modulator of T-Cell Effector Function,KIR2DL2 Immune Checkpoint as Modulator of T-Cell Effector Function,"Project Summary
 Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are mainly expressed by NK cells, although their
expression has also been described in CD4+, CD8+ and γδ T cells. Within CD8 T cells, KIR expression is
induced at later stages of lymphocyte maturation and is thought to regulate specific T cell effector functions.
Within KIR receptors, KIR2DL2 modulates T cell effector functions, as KIR2DL2+ CD8+ T cells present
reduced level of activation-induced cell death, and poor IFN-γ secretion after T cell receptor (TCR)
stimulation. The notion of a suppressive function of KIR2DL2 expression in CD8+ T cells is supported by the
observation that patients that express its cognate ligand, HLA-C1, showed decreased overall survival and
could not control tumor growth. Our preliminary data show that KIR2DL2 expression increases in vivo in
adoptively transferred T cells in patients and in preclinical models of adoptive immunotherapy. Using a
pancreatic tumor model, we found that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells expressing KIR2DL2 were
significantly less cytotoxic than their KIR2DL2- counterparts in presence of KIR2DL2’s ligand. Furthermore,
KIR2DL2 expression in CAR-T cells was associated with reduced antitumor efficacy, in an HLA-I-dependent
manner, in a murine model of pancreatic cancer. Based on these preliminary findings we hypothesize that
KIR2DL2 behaves as a T cell immune checkpoint, modulating T cell effector function and leading to
an ineffective immunosurveillance. Therefore, targeting KIR2DL2 during T cell manufacturing may
improve T cell performance after cell infusion. We will test our hypothesis by 1) Defining the modulatory
mechanisms whereby KIR2DL2 shapes CAR- and TCR-transgenic T cell antitumoral effector function. We
will determine the overall effect of KIR2DL2 engagement in TCR-transgenic and CAR-T cell effector function.
Additionally, we will determine which regions within KIR2DL2 are responsible for its modulatory function.
Finally, we will characterize both the KIR2DL2 signaling interactome and the downstream events triggered
by its ligand interaction by immunoprecipitation and proteomic analyses. 2) Improving T cell performance for
the enhancement of adoptive cell immunotherapies (ACTs) by abrogating KIR2DL2 function. To prevent its
inhibitory effect, manipulation of KIR2DL2 expression and/or signaling will be conducted and adapted to the
current protocols for CAR-T cell manufacturing. Based on the anticipated results, we will link for the first time
the biological and molecular function of KIR2DL2 within therapeutic T cells. The proposed studies will
increase our mechanistic understanding of KIR2DL2 biology and will generate novel cell products with high
translational potential.",,Biotechnology; Cancer; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Immunotherapy,Immunotherapy,0.9096899628639221,Immunotherapy:0.909690; Primary Immunodeficiencies:0.899365; Topical Microbicides:0.898343
Molecular mechanisms of prostate cancer metastasis,Molecular mechanisms of prostate cancer metastasis,"Although locally invasive prostate cancer is nearly always curable, metastatic prostate cancer is usually fatal.
Our research is focused on elucidating mechanisms that promote metastatic progression and underlie
phenotypic heterogeneity of metastases. Toward this end, we have developed a series of genetically engineered
mouse models (GEMMs) that recapitulate the phenotypic heterogeneity of metastatic prostate cancer. The
centerpiece of this collection of GEMMs is the NPKEYFP mouse model, which develops highly penetrant bone
metastasis. This model is complemented by additional GEMMs, namely the NPMEYFP and NPp53EYFP mice, that
display distinctive metastatic phenotypes. We have performed transcriptomic analyses at the bulk tissue and
single-cell level of prostate tumors and metastases from these GEMMs to identify candidate drivers (master
regulators (MRs)) of metastatic progression and phenotypic heterogeneity. Furthermore, we have isolated
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from these metastatic GEMMs to study their heterogeneity at the cellular level. In
particular, we have established a pipeline to isolate and molecularly characterize individual CTCs as organoids
and to study the CTCs at the single-cell level. Our investigations have uncovered several themes that shape the
direction of our research. In particular, our findings support the concept that specific mutational events (such as
loss of function of p53 and activation of MYC and RAS signaling) as well as cellular plasticity are key drivers of
metastatic progression and phenotypic heterogeneity.
Thus, we will investigate our hypothesis that heterogeneity of metastasis represents the culmination of
molecular, cellular, and organismal differences, as follows: In Aim 1, we will study mechanisms of metastatic
progression by: (a) investigating the role of the histone methyltransferase NSD2 by analyses of a new GEMM
with gain of function of NSD2 in prostate tumors; and (b) studying cell-intrinsic mechanisms of metastatic
progression at the single-cell level in primary tumors and lung and bone metastases. In Aim 2, we will investigate
molecular mechanisms of phenotypic heterogeneity of metastasis by analyses of our GEMMs that display a
range of metastatic phenotypes. In Aim 3, we will examine cellular heterogeneity of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)
at the single-cell level using organoid models and single-cell sequencing approaches. Taken together, our
studies are highly innovative in their combination of sophisticated inducible mouse models, single-cell analyses,
organoid culture methods, and computational systems approaches to investigate a central problem in cancer
biology. Our studies of precision modeling of prostate cancer metastasis may ultimately help guide individualized
patient care.",,Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Clinical Research; Genetics; Human Genome; Prostate Cancer; Urologic Diseases,Prostate Cancer,0.9312940835952759,Prostate Cancer:0.931294; Pancreatic Cancer:0.922223; Lung Cancer:0.913310
Project 2: Investigating cell intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of prostate cancer bone metastasis,Project 2: Investigating cell intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of prostate cancer bone metastasis,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The objective of our research is to elucidate tumor cell intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that give rise
to bone metastasis and specify bone tropism. The foundation for our studies is the NPKYPF mouse model, which
develops highly penetrant bone metastasis that is well-conserved with bone metastasis in human prostate
cancer. Analyses of these mice enable investigations of the evolution of bone metastases during cancer
progression in the native microenvironment in androgen-intact and androgen-deprived contexts. We have found
that co-activation of MYC and RAS signaling is essential for bone metastasis, and that MYC activation is
particularly relevant in contexts of androgen deprivation. Our preliminary studies have identified ATAD2 as a
MYC-co-factor that is expressed in bone metastasis, particularly in contexts of androgen deprivation, and
necessary for bone metastasis. In a complementary genome-wide in vivo CRISPR screening based on human
prostate cancer xenografts, we identified CITED2, another MYC co-factor, as a cell-intrinsic driver of bone
metastasis that it is sufficient to promote bone metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, single cell sequencing of primary
tumors and bone metastases from NPKYPF mice has led to the identification master regulators (MRs) that are
candidate cell intrinsic drivers of bone metastasis, while analyses of the non-tumor components have shown that
primary tumors from metastatic NPKYPF mice are deficient for most immune cell populations, but highly enriched
for tumor associated macrophages.
 Thus, we will investigate the hypothesis that bone metastasis represents the culmination of cell intrinsic
drivers from the metastatic cells and tumor cell extrinsic factors in microenvironment of the metastatic bone. In
Aim 1, we will investigate the hypothesis that CITED2 collaborates with MYC to promote bone specificity. In
parallel, we will investigate candidate master regulators (MRs) associated with RAS pathway activation to
elucidate their potential roles in bone metastasis. In Aim 2, we will investigate the hypothesis that ATAD2 is a
co-factor for MYC in contexts of androgen deprivation, and elucidate the relationship of androgen status for the
evolution and underlying mechanisms of bone metastasis. In Aim 3, we will investigate cell extrinsic mechanisms
in the microenvironment of the primary tumor and metastatic bone, to identify relevant cell populations associated
with metastasis, to evaluate their functional role for bone metastasis, and to identify cell extrinsic drivers of bone
metastasis.
Integration: Our studies are highly complementary to investigations of the tumor microenvironment for
neuroendocrine differentiation (Project 3) and tumor progression (Project 1). Validation of candidate regulators
for human bone metastasis will require Core A. Further, our systematic analysis of bone metastasis at the single
cell level, complement efforts in Projects 1 and 3, while our ability to mutually benefit from these data will be
enabled by the data management component of Core B.",,Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Clinical Research; Genetics; Human Genome; Prostate Cancer; Urologic Diseases,Prostate Cancer,0.9221808910369873,Prostate Cancer:0.922181; Pancreatic Cancer:0.911982; Lung Cancer:0.909558
Preclinical analyses of advanced prostate cancer in genetically-engineered mice,Preclinical analyses of advanced prostate cancer in genetically-engineered mice,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Advanced prostate cancer represents a major cause of cancer death in men, usually as a consequence
of treatment failure, which gives rise to aggressive disease variants that are highly metastatic. Among the major
biological processes that are causally dysregulated in advanced prostate cancer are those related to DNA repair.
Notably, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are among the most frequently altered DNA repair genes in advanced prostate
cancer, and are also key targets for its treatment. To study their functions in prostate cancer, we have generated
genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) based on inducible loss-of-function of Brca1 and Brca2 in the
prostate. In preliminary studies, we have found that loss-of-function of Brca2 results in aggressive prostate
tumors with highly penetrant metastases, including to bone, that are coincident with increased DNA damage and
accelerated by androgen deprivation. In parallel, we have developed computational tools to elucidate the
molecular determinants of Brca1 and Brca2 functions in prostate cancer. We have also developed a new
precision oncology platform called OncoLoop, to computationally match individual patients to individual GEMMs,
and to predict and validate drugs that target specific patient-GEMM pairs.
 Leveraging these models and resources, we will systematically investigate the functions of BRCA1 and
BRCA2 in prostate cancer, guided by the hypothesis that defective DNA repair plays an important role in
prostate cancer progression and treatment, particularly in the context of androgen deprivation. In Aim 1, we will
investigate the consequences of loss-of-function of Brca1 and Brca2 in GEMMs, GEMM-derived organoid
models, and patient-derived human organoid models for prostate tumorigenesis, metastasis, and DNA damage
response. These studies will provide fundamental insights into the functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in prostate
cancer and elucidate the relationship of DNA repair mechanisms for disease progression. In Aim 2, we will
investigate molecular determinants of DNA repair functions in prostate cancer by identifying and functionally
characterizing master regulators (MRs) that represent mechanistic determinants of Brca1 and Brca2 loss-of-
function in prostate tumors and metastases. MRs will be prioritized based on conservation with human prostate
cancer, and functionally validated in mouse and human organoids. We will complement these studies by
analyses of tumors and metastases using single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) to identify MR signatures
associated with specific cell states. In Aim 3, we will leverage our GEMMs, GEMM-derived organoids and
allografts, and patient-derived organotypic models to pursue co-clinical investigations of DNA repair function in
prostate cancer. In Aim 3A, we will systematically evaluate drugs/drug combinations currently in or advancing

Investigating mechanisms of bladder cancer metastasis,Investigating mechanisms of bladder cancer metastasis,"The major cause of bladder cancer deaths is due to metastasis, yet to date metastatic bladder cancer
(mMIBC) has not been extensively studied and many salient issues remain unresolved. One of the major
challenges that has hampered progress in studying mMIBC is the lack of suitable models to investigate
metastatic progression in vivo. We have now generated novel genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs)
that develop highly penetrant mMIBC. These new are based on our established GEMM, in which bladder-specific
co-inactivation of the Pten and p53 tumor suppressors leads to invasive disease with a low incidence of
metastasis. Crossing these Pten; p53 mice with mice harboring loss-of-function of Arid1a, an epigenetic regulator
that is dysregulated in a high percentage of human bladder cancers, results in lethal bladder cancer with >80%
incidence of metastasis. In addition, treatment of the Pten; p53 mice with a low dose of the carcinogen N-butyl-
N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN) leads to mMIBC with >60% incidence. In parallel, we have implemented
state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to identify mechanistic determinants—master regulators (MRs)—of
metastatic progression in the GEMMs. MRs enriched in metastatic tumors in the GEMMs are conserved with
human bladder cancer, and are enriched for those associated with lineage plasticity. To identify drugs that target
these conserved MRs, we implemented OncoTreat, a computational algorithm that prioritizes drugs based on
their ability to invert the activities of biologically-relevant MR. To validate these drugs, we have generated an
extensive biobank of human patient derived organoid models. Leveraging these GEMMs, human patient derived
organoids and systems approaches, we are ideally poised to investigate the hypothesis that the transition from
pre-invasive to metastatic disease is driven by the sequential activities of master regulators, including for lineage
plasticity, which can be elucidated and targeted by studying metastatic progression in these GEMMs. We will
pursue three Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will leverage our GEMMs of mMIBC to systematically investigate the
biological processes and molecular mechanisms underlying metastatic progression in vivo. In Aim 2, we will
elucidate master regulators of metastatic progression, focusing on those associated with the transition from pre-
metastatic to metastatic MIBC, and/or that distinguish tumors from their corresponding metastases, metastases
to different organ sites, and, as feasible, pre-metastatic clusters from overt metastases. We will prioritize MRs
that are conserved with human bladder cancer, as well as those associated with lineage plasticity. In Aim 3, we
will seek to identify new drugs for mMIBC using the OncoTreat algorithm to identify compounds that invert the
activity of MRs of metastasis. We will prioritize candidate drugs that (1) target lineage plasticity mechanisms,
and/or (2) are inferred for patients that do not have evident actionable driver mutations. Altogether, our studies
will provide a comprehensive analysis of the biology, mechanisms, and treatments for mMIBC, with the
translational goal of identifying new therapeutic targets that may improve patient outcomes.",,Cancer; Clinical Research; Genetics; Urologic Diseases,Cancer,0.9164502620697021,Cancer:0.916450; Rare Diseases:0.916094; Prostate Cancer:0.914295
Cellular plasticity gives rise to phenotypic equilibrium in small cell lung carcinoma,Cellular plasticity gives rise to phenotypic equilibrium in small cell lung carcinoma,"ABSTRACT
Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is one of the most intractable human cancers to cure. It is an aggressive tumor
characterized by rapid growth, metastatic progression, and initial response followed by almost invariable
resistance to therapy. Studies to date have not resolved the extent that diverse genetic and epigenetic programs
drive SCLC and contribute to its lethality. We combined one of the largest and most diverse inventories of
patient-derived xenograft models of SCLC globally with an ex vivo culture system that maintains
transcriptional fidelity with matched primary SCLC tumor to identify distinct and dynamic phenotypic states that
differ in functional attributes within individual tumors. We show that human SCLC tumors display distinctive
equilibria in the proportion of cells in various phenotypic (not merely transcriptional) states. We also show that
SCLC states are highly regulated by multivalent cellular plasticity and we measure the kinetics of this plasticity
at the single cell level. Importantly, standard of care chemotherapies in this disease preferentially kill specific
cancer cell states. In this proposal, we posit that understanding the facets of SCLC's intratumoral heterogeneity
will: 1) contribute to our understanding of a poorly characterized aspect of cancer heterogeneity; 2) reveal how
stochasticity and/or ecological cues in single-cell behaviors promote phenotypic equilibrium in cancer
populations; 3) provide insight into the biological and clinical behavior of SCLC; and 4) advance desperately
needed new therapeutic strategies of epigenetic reprogramming in this recalcitrant disease. Our team of
investigators have content expertise in several computational, experimental, and translational methods pertinent
to this proposal including human-derived in vivo and ex vivo model systems, single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk
genetic and expression analysis, single cell fluorescence tracking, and mathematical and statistical modeling.
Our integrative approach is poised to formulate and validate a unified model of cellular states and program
diversity in SCLC. If successful, the characterization of malignant cell ontogenic programs (SA1), their plasticity
(SA2), and the advancement of new therapies designed to combat plasticity by epigenetic reprogramming (SA3)
will advance a unique scientific canvas for the study of this highly lethal disease.",,Biotechnology; Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Human Genome; Lung; Lung Cancer; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases,Lung Cancer,0.9230991005897522,Lung Cancer:0.923099; Cancer:0.921392; Rare Diseases:0.919976
A biomarker-driven strategy to guide the use of radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer,A biomarker-driven strategy to guide the use of radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer,"ABSTRACT
There is an urgent need to nominate biomarkers that are likely to predict the efficacy of radiotherapy and
accelerate their clinical translation. Efforts thus far have been limited in large part because the genetic features
regulating tumor cell survival and their frequency across and within individual cancer types had not been studied
on a large-scale. Our group completed the largest profiling effort of survival after radiation in cancer cell lines,
comprising a diverse collection of 533 genetically annotated tumor cell lines from 26 cancer types. To
complement this work, we recently initiated the systematic profiling of >1000 genetic variants that could
potentially contribute to the resistance of cancer cells to radiation. We combined results from our profiling efforts
to identify features that predict the resistance of lung cancer cells to radiation. The objective in this investigation
is to advance the clinical translation of two of the most important regulators of radiation resistance in lung cancer,
Nrf2 and Braf. The Nrf2 pathway is genetically altered in ~28% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) and cells with mutations in NFE2L2 or KEAP1 are the most highly correlated with resistance to
radiation. To identify genetic dependencies of Nrf2-active tumors, we used computational and experimental
approaches to demonstrate the frequent co-occurrence between Nrf2 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
alteration in NSCLCs. Using genetic and chemical means we show that antagonizing the catalytic subunit of
PI3K, p110 (encoded by PIK3CA), decreases Nrf2 activity and reverses radiation resistance driven by this
pathway. These results provide the rationale to advance a radiosensitization strategy for patients with Nrf2-active
NSCLC by targeting PI3K. Our profiling efforts also demonstrate a critical role for BRAF, which is genetically
altered in ~7% of patients with NSCLC, in the resistance of lung cancer cells to radiation. We show, for the first
time, that BRAF kinase domain mutations confer resistance to radiation in lung cancers and that they, unlike
Nrf2 pathway alterations, are almost invariably a minor component of the tumor (i.e. they are subclonal). We use
mathematical and experimental models to show that clonal architecture has significant implications for the
likelihood of response to targeted therapies and radiation. Together, these results provide a compelling rationale
to examine the role of Nrf2 and Braf alterations in predicting outcomes after radiotherapy and advance a
genomically-guided radiosensitization strategy for patients with these tumors. If these hypotheses are correct,
our results will demonstrate that radiotherapeutic sensitizers can be selected based on both the identity and type
(clonal v. subclonal) of genetic alterations identified in a patient's cancer, prompting an evolution in the use of
radiation from a generic approach to one that is guided by the genetic composition of individual tumors.",,Biotechnology; Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Human Genome; Lung; Lung Cancer; Precision Medicine; Radiation Oncology,Radiation Oncology,0.9459059238433838,Radiation Oncology:0.945906; Lung Cancer:0.938154; Cancer:0.937674
Regulation of re-replication in mammalian cells,Regulation of re-replication in mammalian cells,"Project Summary
Mammalian cells have evolved multiple non-overlapping mechanisms to ensure that DNA replication initiates
from origins of replications once and only once in each division cycle; loss of control over these mechanisms
induces genomic instability, an important driver of malignant transformation. Increasing evidence suggests that
origin utilization and activation in higher eukaryotes is influenced by epigenetic factors, but exact mechanisms
are largely undefined. Our long-term goals are to elucidate the underpinning mechanisms that control replication
initiation in mammalian cells and to understand how perturbations of these mechanisms provokes genomic
instability. The histone methyltransferase SET8 is emerging as a key regulator of replication initiation in
mammalian cells through its mono-methyltransferase activity on histone H4K20. The cell cycle regulated enzyme
is essential for origin licensing in G1 phase of the cell cycle, but is proteolytically degraded in S-phase; blocking
this step triggers reiterative replication initiation within the same cell cycle or re-replication. Both SET8 and
H4K20me, however, are also involved in transcriptional repression and in the repair of DNA double strand breaks
(DSBs), but whether these seemingly independent activities play a role in replication initiation or re-replication is
not known. Most importantly, little to nothing is known about the nature or characteristics of the re-replication
products that accumulate in cells with defective SET8 degradation, nor is there information on where in the
genome re-replication occurs or if certain genomic regions are more prone to re-replication induction. Our new
results show that re-replication resulting from defective SET8 degradation is not a stochastic process, with few
genomic sites exhibit large and significant copy number gains, reminiscent of genomic amplifications that are
seen in cancer cells. Additional preliminary studies suggest that re-replication may originate from DNA double
strand breaks (DSBs) that may spontaneously arise during replication, and requires the activity of genes involved
both in transcriptional silencing and in DSB repair. Our innovative preliminary studies and experimental
approaches are designed to thoroughly examine this alternative model of re-replication induction. In Aim 1, we
will determine the magnitude (copy number gains) and genomic distribution of the re-replicated DNA in bulk and
single cells with defective SET8 degradation and following the induction of DSBs at defined genomic sites. We
will also test if these parameters vary in different cancer cell types and in cancer vs. non-cancer cells. In Aim 2,
we will define the roles of histone H4K20 methylation, transcriptional silencing by the H4K20me reader
L3MBTL1, and proteins involved in the repair of DSBs in effecting re-replication. The successful execution of the
proposed aims promises to increase our understanding of the mechanisms regulating replication initiation in
mammalian cells, and lead to a better understanding of how perturbations of these mechanisms provokes
genomic instability.",,Biotechnology; Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Human Genome,Human Genome,0.9165555238723755,Human Genome:0.916556; Regenerative Medicine:0.911637; Rare Diseases:0.910931
Chemoproteomic mapping of the ligandable ribonucleoproteome using phloroglucinol meroterpenoids,Chemoproteomic mapping of the ligandable ribonucleoproteome using phloroglucinol meroterpenoids,"The long-term goal of the PI’s research program is to understand how RNAs exert their regulatory effects through
interaction with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and identify the basis for their therapeutic effects in human diseases.
RBPs interact with RNAs to form ribonucleoprotein complexes that that control the fate of nearly every transcript.
These roles are essential for normal human physiology, as defects in RBP function are implicated in autoimmunity,
neurodegeneration, cancer, and innate antiviral immune response.
The molecular mechanisms of RNA-protein
interactions (RPIs) that underpin gene expression and form the basis of numerous human diseases remain
obscure. Consequently, RBPs are rapidly emerging as promising targets for the development of chemical probes
and candidate therapeutic agents. The discovery of therapeutically tractable RPIs, however, remains a formidable
challenge. This proposal describes an interdisciplinary program leveraging quantitative chemoproteomics, natural
product synthesis, molecular biology, and biochemistry to exploit reactivity of proteinaceous lysines at the RPI
interface that modulate the structural properties of ribonucleoprotein complexes. Preliminary findings from the PI
demonstrate that phloroglucinol meroterpenoid natural products modulate RPIs through reversible-covalent
modification of RNA-binding lysines in RBPs. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that high occurrence of
reactive lysines at the RPI interface may provide an unprecedented opportunity in the development of precision
chemical tools with specificity for RBPs and on-target potency gained through reversible-covalent modification.
 The proposed research program embodies three integrated projects that address specific challenges in
targeting RBPs in human cells. First, the lack of traditional enzymatic pockets or functional epitopes renders RBPs
as canonically intractable targets. This proposal aims to overcome this challenge through reversible-covalent
modification of RNA-binding lysines at the RPI interface using phloroglucinol meroterpenoids. Second, the full
complement of lysines with heightened reactivity at the RPI interface remains unexplored. This proposal aims to
overcome this limitation by using innovative chemoproteomic methods to globally map lysine reactivity and
ligandability directly in human cells. Last, the functional consequences of meroterpenoid-lysine interactions remain
obscure. By leveraging integrative RNA pulldown and extraction methods with RNA-interactome capture and
immunofluorescence imaging, the proposal aims to identify advanced tool compounds that perturb RPIs through
site-selective modification of lysines in RBPs. Overall, the proposed research program is significant because over
the next five years it will deliver innovative chemical tools and proteomic methods that enrich understanding of the
pathophysiological functions of RPIs and identify the basis for their therapeutic effects in human diseases.
This proposal offers progress in a number of NIGMS major research programs, including fundamentals of
molecular properties and interactions (BBCB), coding and noncoding RNA mechanisms of action and function
(GMCDB), and new methods and targets for drug discovery (PPBC).",,Genetics; Natural Products,Precision Medicine,0.9120503664016724,Precision Medicine:0.912050; Lymphatic Research:0.910830; Prevention:0.909998
A dual-layer flat panel x-ray detector based on an engineered amorphous chalcogenide alloy for quantifying coronary artery calcium,A dual-layer flat panel x-ray detector based on an engineered amorphous chalcogenide alloy for quantifying coronary artery calcium,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Heart disease is extremely prevalent, with about one in every four deaths (in the US) being attributed to heart
disease. Early detection of cardiovascular events, especially before patients become symptomatic, has immense
impact in preventive healthcare, reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease.
Coronary artery calcification (CAC), a strong predictor for future cardiovascular events, is a component of
atherosclerotic plaque buildup in the arteries that supply blood to the heart, leading to coronary artery disease
(CAD). Identification of CAC is clinically important because it is used for cardiovascular risk and therapy decision
making. Currently, CAC is quantified by computed tomography (CT), however, CT-based population screening
is not widely utilized due to cost and radiation burden. Chest x-rays (CXR) are the most common medical imaging
procedure and have higher availability than CT in low-resource settings, lower radiation dose, and higher patient
throughput that could be used for screening purposes. Unfortunately, due to the lack of quantification in CXR,
only qualitative descriptors are possible. The objective of this proposal is therefore to bring much-needed
quantification to CXR, particularly for detecting and quantifying CAC by combining a new dual-layer x-ray
detector and artificial-intelligence based image processing. The proposed dual-layer detector utilizes alloys of
amorphous selenium (a-Se) that achieve favorable electro-optical properties (e.g., higher charge carrier
mobilities and higher gain) compared to conventional a-Se based x-ray detectors. This technology has four major
components: (1) a top layer direct convection a-Se alloys on an imaging backplane, (2) a bottom layer indirect
conversion a-Se alloy with intrinsic gain on an imaging backplane coupled to a scintillator, (3) top panel and
bottom panel integration into a dual-layer detector, and (4) a machine learning algorithm that enhances accuracy
of the quantitative information from the dual-layer detector. The detector development leverages a mature
platform from Varex Imaging, a leading manufacturer of x-ray detectors. We expect to show that the proposed
system has higher spatial resolution images and higher sensitivity to detect small, high contrast features
(calcifications) and to separate materials such as calcium from soft tissue. This approach will allow accurate
quantification of predictive factors and will have immense impact in proactive healthcare, improving the clinical
outcomes of patients, and reducing the number of deaths associated with cardiovascular disease. While our
focus is on CAC, we expect this technology to broadly improve CXR for early detection of lung cancer,
tuberculosis, and other diseases such as osteoporosis via quantification of bone mineral density.",,Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease; Lung; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Osteoporosis; Prevention,Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease,0.925406813621521,Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease:0.925407; Atherosclerosis:0.923029; Rare Diseases:0.915375

"Alcohol's Effects on Affective, Cognitive, and Behavioral Responses in a Virtual Reality Dating Simulation","Alcohol's Effects on Affective, Cognitive, and Behavioral Responses in a Virtual Reality Dating Simulation","Abstract
Approximately half of all sexual assaults involve alcohol consumption by the perpetrator, victim, or both. Self-
report surveys conducted with victims and perpetrators have provided valuable information about alcohol's role
in sexual assault; however, causality cannot be established from correlational designs. When participants are
randomly assigned to drink conditions in laboratory studies, causal conclusions can be made regarding the
effects of acute alcohol consumption on behavior. The major challenge for experimentalists is to develop
proxies for sexual assault that have strong construct validity and experimental realism. Virtual reality
environments (VRE) provide the opportunity for participants to become immersed in the simulated
environment; thus, participants are expected to behave in ways and to make choices that closely relate to their
behavior outside the laboratory. The goal of the proposed research is to build on the promising findings from
the PIs recent R21 grant (AA020876) that developed a dating simulation as a new experimental paradigm for
examining alcohol's role in acquaintance sexual assault perpetration committed by men against women. The
first specific aim of the proposed research involves enhancing the VR dating simulation based on insights from
our empirical findings and new technological developments. The updated simulation will be 3-dimensional, with
participants wearing head mounted displays that immerse them in the virtual world with their female
companion. Changes will be developed and evaluated in focus groups and cognitive interviews with male and
female participants to maximize ecological validity. The second specific aim involves systematically evaluating
the impact of situational cues manipulated within the virtual reality environment which are expected to evoke
the ""in the moment"" cognitions and feelings that are hypothesized to increase the likelihood of sexual
aggression among men predisposed to be sexually aggressive. The third specific aim involves examining the
effects of acute alcohol consumption on men's sexually aggressive responses in the virtual reality simulation.
Based on the findings from the studies associated with Specific Aim 2, situational factors will be manipulated
resulting in a 2 (alcohol condition: sober vs. intoxicated; target BrAC = .08) X 2 (high or low level of cue that
affects participants' perceptions of the woman's sexual interest) X 2 (high or low level of cue that affects
participants' sense of entitlement and anger after a refusal) design. Risk factors associated with sexual assault
perpetration will be assessed in a separate session and are expected to interact with alcohol and cue
conditions, such that intoxicated men who are predisposed to sexual aggression (e.g., high pre-existing levels
of hostile masculinity) and exposed to sexual interest and entitlement/anger cues are hypothesized to be most
likely to be sexually aggressive. Future studies can alter aspects of the simulation to increase generalizability
to different populations. The applicants’ long-term goal is to identify modifiable risk and protective factors that
can be used to develop evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions to reduce sexual violence.",,"Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health; Behavioral and Social Science; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Mental Health; Physical Injury - Accidents and Adverse Effects; Prevention; Social Determinants of Health; Substance Misuse; Violence Against Women; Violence Research; Women's Health Research","Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health",0.9184890389442444,"Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health:0.918489; Substance Misuse:0.912288; Prevention:0.906940"
