More specifically, a health disparity is a health difference that adversely affects populations who are disadvantaged based on one or more of the following health outcomes: 1) higher incidence and/or prevalence and earlier onset of disease, 2) higher prevalence of risk factors, unhealthy behaviors, or clinical measures in the causal pathway of a disease outcome, 3) higher rates of condition-specific symptoms, reduced global daily functioning, or self-reported health-related quality of life using standardized measures, 4) premature and/or excessive mortality from diseases where population rates differ, 5) greater global burden of disease using a standardized metric. Research on health disparities examines the influence of individual behavior and biology, clinical health care, physical and interpersonal environment, social determinants, and other underlying mechanisms that lead to differences in health outcomes. Research also seeks to identify evidence-based approaches to reduce the unequal burdens of morbidity and mortality among disadvantaged populations, such as racial and ethnic minority groups, low socioeconomic status individuals, rural individuals, and people with disabilities in the United States.&nbsp;",
